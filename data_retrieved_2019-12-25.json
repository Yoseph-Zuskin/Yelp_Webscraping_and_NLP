Everything looked picture perfect as though it was from an anime. I didn't have a chance to buy it, but their strawberry shortcake looked like absolute perfection. Perfect amount of filling etc. \n\nDuring this visit I got their vanilla custard cream puffs, matcha tiramisu, tiramisu and a matchacchino. \n\nThe cream puff was absolutely amazing. Light crispy out layer and a perfect amount of filling. \n\nMatcha tiramisu has a good amount of matcha. Not overpowering but enough to satisfy your matcha fix. Made me close my eyes after every bite.\n\nTiramisu was just your standard tiramisu. Good but nothing special. As for the matchcchino, nothing that stands out. Had better matcha lattes elsewhere.\n\nOverall, definitely returning here for other pastries. Once you try it, you'll make it your goto pastry store.", 4], ["The bakery shop is abit far from where I live but decided to give it a try because there is another Japanese convenient store close by. So I can visit two places while I am in the area.\n\nIn short this is a decent place and clean but I find that cake/dessert is a bit too sweet for my taste. However, their savoury sandwich is quite good. I like it! Please see my photo.\n\nWe also tried the cappuccino, but its average, to be honest, taste like the kind you will get from the nespresso coffee machine...\n\nThe staff is friendly also...\n\nTo conclude if you live around the area I would say this would be the place to go for bakery. But for me, it's a long drive to get there so I probably won't go there again soon.", 3], ["This patisserie is a hidden gem for japanese sweets. \n\nThe cream puffs are as good as everyone else says it is. It is so so light and fluffy, i think i could consume 10 in one sitting. it's that goodddd.\n\nThe houjicha pudding is the bomb. The roasted tea flavour is really strong and the texture of the pudding is silky smooth. \n\nThe Creme caramel is also a good choice if you aren't into roasted tea flavours. However, the texture is more runny and less firm compared to the houjicha. \n\nThe matcha latte wasn't anything special, so I probably wouldn't come  back for the drinks. \n\nI will definitely be back to try their cakes and other baked pastries.", 4], ["I am in love with their cream puffs. They are so light and delicious! I visited this bakery and bought cream puffs to go. The pastry was airy and flaky. The cream has a smooth consistency. These cream puffs are a lovely snack to satisfy your sweet tooth. \n \nThe bakery is neat and clean. The space is bright and inviting. Service was friendly. I will be back for more cream puffs!", 4], ["Mon K is a hidden gem in East York.  It is a cute little shop that serves Japan pastry and macaron.  Their cakes are well made, the monte blanc is a must try.  The vanilla latte is creamy, but the macaron is a little bit sweet and chewy, I am a little bit disappointed.  Overall, a great little pastry shop in East York. I would recommend this shop to anyone who loves pastry and cakes.", 4], ["Omg found this gem and I love their matcha desserts it was soooo good especially the matcha monte blanc.

Was craving for dessert, so I looked up yelp and found this place. Cute store. Yummy smell inside. Bought 8 different pastries - might as well, since I don't go to downtown area (i.e.anywhere with subway line) a lot. Tried 2 right away, OH SO GOOD!! Had to hold off eating the rest (cz I bought some as gift). Then as soon as I left the store, just realized I need to walk back 45min (in hot weather). Felt so worried with my green tea cheesecake on my way. Anyway, cheesecake changed its shape due to heat, but STILL taste delish!! Gave 2 away to colleagues (after debating for sometime to give it away or not) , and they all love it. This means, for real, EVERY single DIFFERENT pastries I bought is GREAT! They are not too sweet. Not too 'heavy'. It's perfect! My husband (who doesn't like sweet) love it too.", 4], ["I love cute little desserts: a perfect way to indulge without overindulging. \n\nThings I tried:\n\nYuzu (a Japanese citrus fruit), Earl Grey and a Green Tea Macaroon - $2 each for a two bite sweet treat with a crisp, fragile shell and a soft chewy center. Not fond of the flavors I chose; next time I'll try the other flavors and pair it with tea or coffee.\n\nJapanese Souffle Cheesecake - The owner said it is a similar recipe to Uncle Tetsu's but while Uncle Tetsu's is more spongy, hers is more like a traditional cheesecake. More cheese than cake, it tasted better with the fresh fruit.\n\nCookie Choux a la Creme (Cream puff) - This was my absolute favorite for the divine custard whipped cream flavored with real vanilla. It was so light but amazingly rich in flavor; can I just have a tub of this to go?\n\nImportant note: paid parking in the front and it's head in diagonal parking. Wouldn't be so bad if Coxwell Avenue wasn't so busy all the time: pretty dangerous backing out in traffic. You might want to bring a friend along to help you spot cars or take the bus. Also according to Evo X there's free 1 hour parking on Lankin M-F 9a-5p if you don't mind the walk.\n\nI would definitely come back to try more of their desserts if I was in the area.", 3], ["I was drawn here by the grey reviews and because it was listed as a top bakery on blogto. I was in the mood for matcha and ended up getting both the matcha creampuff ($3.50) as well as the matcha tiramisu ($5.95).\n\nThe tiramisu was not really what I expected. The cake consisted of layers of green tea sponge cake and mascarpone and cream cheese mousse. Sadly, the matcha flavours were overpowered by the flavour from the cream cheese. The mousse itself was quite good and had a creamy consistency but when neither the matcha or tiramisu flavours come through, it seems the dessert has missed its mark.\n\nThe cream puff came highly recommended by others on yelp and as expected, had a nice velvety custard with an authentic matcha flavour. I was quite impressed with the amount of custard in the pastry but I did find the puff itself to be a little on the harder side. When I compare it to the cream puffs from Bibble and Sip in NYC, it comes up a bit lacking. Nonetheless, still a a good cream puff and definitely satisfied my matcha craving.\n\nA few flavours of Cream Caramel did catch my eye while I was there and since I was quite impressed with the custard in the cream puffs, I may be back to give this place another try.", 3], ["I lovvvvvvve this place.  It is now my usual lunch place on my workdays.  I'm so glad my work place is located nearby.   \n\nI love their croissant sandwiches.  It is simply because their croissants are the best I've ever had, and ingredients are fresh.  All of the bakeries, including croissants, quiche, baguettes, dessert cakes, macaroons, apple turnover, cold brewed green tea, espresso, etc etc are good.  I love their decoration.  The two Japanese ladies (I bet they are cuz they speak fluent Japanese lol) are very friendly.   All these combination make this place such a fabulous Western and Japanese fusion bakery and cafe.  It is just the style I like and enjoy.  \n\nI know I should give it a five star but the service is a bit slow when people come at the same time.  Therefore, how about 4.5 stars?

There are a lot to choose from. \n\nKuro Goma Pudding ($3.20) - Light and Smooth, I do love Black Seasame\nChestnut Pie with Almond Cream ($3.20) - Rich and Buttery, I do love Chestnut\nMizudashi Sencha ($2.20) - Cold Brewed Green Tea, high in antioxidant \n\nSince I was having everything to go, the staff did package them securely for me.

I paid $37 including tax for this lovely cake. It serves 8 people generously, but I think you can serve up to 10 people. \n\nThe chestnut was very fresh and the cream in the middle was light, airy, and fluffy.

Had the Salmon dish, probably one of the best salmon dishes I've had, from the amazing crispy skin to the risotto, a flavour extravaganza as you find yourself discovering more than you thought.

I went in at about 8 PM on a weeknight, it was 2/3 empty.

I repeated to the waitress that I had hoped to enjoy the cocktail first; she said she had told the manager that but he insisted that fast service was good. I overheard her go back to tell him that I was not pleased with this, and he yelled at her that it didn't matter and fast service was good.\n\nThe chickpea and carrot pur\u00e9e was good; the edible parts of the lamb were too, but it was half chunks of fat and gristle. I wasn't interested in dessert after that, but the table beside me seemed to be enjoying theirs. If you want to be in and out in 20 minutes, go to a food court where it will cost you a quarter the money and you'll probably get less attitude. If you want great food to savour, go elsewhere. Konjiki ramen next door is amazing, the fast turnover is more appropriate there, and you'd pay half as much even if you had the lobster ramen special.\n\nBad service happens, but pros will apologise and try to make it right, not yell at the waitress and ignore the customer.

The plate presentation was beautiful. The cocktails were quite nice. We ordered the lavender bees knees drink and the savage sour. Both were wonderful.  Every table got sliced bread and a tomato like spread that's really delicious. For appetizers, we got the charred octopus and a hummus/tahina spread. You can tell the hummus is of high quality and the first taste you get really shows you that. I got the strip steak with was served with a mushroom barley risotto. Now that is something you don't see everyday. The risotto was quite nice and the steak was cooked to perfection. The dish you should get though is the lamb chop. It was an excellent dish.

The eggplant dip was good but I wish it came with more potato crisps as it seemed to lack balance. The french fries were wonderful, not too oily but still crispy. Finally, we ordered the nutella cheesecake for dessert. They put a candle on it and one of the servers sang happy birthday to my boyfriend which was a pleasant surprise. The nutella cheesecake was to die for. I would put it up there in terms of best dessert I ever had next to the Keg's Billy Miner Pie.

After a bit more browsing of the pictures, menu and the good reviews, I decided to try this place out. \n\nI came here on a Friday evening with 2 others and it didn't start off too well. 3 servers greeted us when we entered as it looks like their computer/cashier station is right by the door. That was fine. One server stated we can sit at the table right in front of the door entrance. Mind you this place was not busy when we came in.

To which we agreed and was seated around the corner on the other side.\n\nNext, our server who was helping us didn't seem quite there. We had asked for clarification on the ingredients of a couple of dishes as we weren't sure what they were but our questions were not answered so we just gave up and made our orders...service here I have to say from this experience was average at best.\n\nAs for the food, it was good. We ordered the Baby Kale and Arugula Salad, Charred Eggplant, Butternut Squash Risotto, Barramundi and the Beef Carpaccio. The only thing for the Beef Carpaccio and the Barramundi was that they used a bit too much olive oil (?) so you could see the glistening layer of it on both dishes...my friends also said they could taste/feel the oily-ness. The risotto, however, tasted wonderful. It was too bad that they didn't have the Wild Mushroom Risotto with the duck confit that I saw from the Yelp pictures that I really wanted to try. But oh well. I think the salad, charred eggplant and the risotto were the better picks of our entire order.\n\nI'm sure this place is wonderful with their food and service given the 4 star reviews.

They had amazing decor with interesting wall art. \n\nWe got the pork chops and the Lamb Shank and both were delicious. The lamb shank was very tender and melted delicately in your mouth. It came with lentils and sauce and it was an overall amazing combo. The pork chops was delicious as well with some grilled veggies with it. For drinks I tried the Apple tree and thought it was ok. I didn't really taste the mango or the mezcal and felt it was diluted in flavor.

It was pretty good, but nothing special.  Maybe a touch under seasoned.\n\nThen I had the burrata salad which was phenomenal.  Truly.  The cheese was a large ball and the dish was flanked with roasted garlic cloves, a delicate pesto, crispy shallots, roasted cherry tomatoes, micro greens and wonderfully toasted bread.  Fabulous.\n\nAs a side (which I didn't need b/c the aforementioned salad was generous), I had the crispy cauliflower.  It was served atop house made labaneh, which google tells me is just yogurt (essentially), but it was delicious.

I just lifted my bottle once and called him, he didn't answer but brought water a few minutes later. Overall, he was very nice and friendly. \n\nWe ordered one lamb stew and daily special. Actually we waited for a really long time and felt a little disappointed. They provided bread and butter before served the main dish.

I got a nice, beautiful salmon belly and was stuffed after eating the whole dish without even starting on my sweet potatoes! I absolutely had no room for dessert although I really wanted to try some. If you're going to get appetizers, don't order any sides with your main dish! \n\nOur waiter was super friendly and was glad to help us take many pictures of us for the ocassion until the end of our meal. After rejecting dessert, he was curious as to why we came here for dinner and we told him it was my friends and I birthday. We asked for the bill and it took him quite a while to bring it to us. We didn't really noticed since we were just talking and catching up until he came out with two desserts for us!! He sang happy birthday and gave it to us on the house (ofc, we gave him much more tips!)\n\nReally great experience and  service, will come here again for sure.", 5], ["The veal special was outstanding!!  As was the salmon.... everything was perfectly cooked.  Blue cheese mashed are amazing!!    Delicious!\nAmbiance was comfortable,  casual.  Not too loud, not too bright.  \nOur waiter, Sean.  provided excellent service.  He was friendly and personable.   Above and beyond expectations!\nLove this place!", 5], ["Elm tree had amazing ambience, courteous service, and decadent food at a steal of a price!!\n\nWe had the scallops for appetizer and it was perfectly seared and paired with a fruity sauce. \n\nFor our entrees, we tried the duck confit and Chilean sea bass! Duck confit came with perfect al dante risotto. It's not everyday that you see Chilean sea bass on the menu so it's a must try!\n\nDessert was also superb. We had the poached whole pear with mascarpone cheese and cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Poached pear was the highlight! They also offer sticky toffee pudding which will be tried next time. \n\nOverall, the great decor, gorgeous plating, and flavour profiles are all reasons why we'll be going back for more soon!", 5], ["We had our company lunch at this location. When we walked in, I felt it was pretty tight but the place feels chic. Nice casual decor. \n\nThe options are fairly limited but for what they do have, it is flavourful. I did have the Morrocan lamb shank whose foods are known to be flavourful. Needless to say, I was satisfied, price and portion wise.\n\nThey could really have more beer options, but I guess it's more of a wine place.", 4], ["It was a busy night for the restaurant and we appreciate that they gave us a table even though we did not have a reservation. My daughter and I had the cornish hen and the lamb shank, which we shared. Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked and were very enjoyable. Plus the yummy crispy fries. But my favorite part of the meal was the summer salad. It's hard to make a salad with wow factor but this salad had it. The presentation was artistic, the components were a perfect complement, and the dressing had just the right amount of acid and fat. Note that most of the offerings on the menu are rich and heavy - it is not the place to grab a lite dinner. Service was very professional.", 4], ["Attentive awesome service and every bite was flavorful and amazing. The filet mignon cooked rare was a glorious experience.

The service was impeccable and very friendly. We decided to share an octopus as an entree and as themain course, the wild mushroom risotto and the beef tenderloin. All three dishes were marvelous.

Service was good", 5], ["I had a great experience at The Elm Tree this past Sunday night. My friend and I had just finished at the Elmwood Spa down the street and walked in with no reservations this long weekend.\n\nFood - I was very impressed with the dishes for the price served. My friend and I shared the Calamari w/ Ratatouille, while we bother ordered the Duck Confit w/ Risotto. The calamari was one of the smoothest I've ever had, and complemented the spices in the ratatouille. The duck confit w/ risotto was very creamy and ended up being a very heavy dish. They also served bread w/ hummus throughout the meal, which was a nice Mediterranean touch.\n\nService - Excellent service. Our waiter constantly refilled our bread and hummus throughout the meal and was attentive. \n\nAmbience - The restaurant was slightly dim and had a nice ambience to it. Would recommend for a date or gathering with friends.", 5], ["The duck confit is their specialty, you must get it. It's a smaller portion but it was extremely tasty. I asked for my duck to be extra crispy and they delivered. The crunch was a perfect compliment to the risotto.\n\nThe rib eye sandwich is a really good portion, it came to the table and everyone was eyeing my friend's ribeye. The fries were good and I tried the sandwich and it was good too. Nothing memorable though, still preferred my duck confit.\n\nAnother friend got the orzo pasta. It was alright for $18. Still preferred my duck confit. My risotto was so much better than his orzo pasta and I got a duck on top of it. Very little seafood in it too. \n\nA shared app was the beef carpaccio. Extremely tasty! Amazing appetizer, glad we got it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste for people who aren't accustomed to eating raw meat. But it's the same as sushi to me - glad I got to try it.\n\nApart from the beef carpaccio, the restaurant also offered some sort of p\u00e2t\u00e9 ?? as a complimentary pre-dish. The table was unsure what it was, we assumed it was a beef p\u00e2t\u00e9 served with some good bread. But honestly it tasted more like an olive p\u00e2t\u00e9. Way too much olive taste, but hey if you like olives! \n\nI'm not a beer fanatic but thee general consensus on the Hopcity Hopbot IPA was two thumbs up! Not a fan of the beer but I could at least describe it as having a strong floral taste? I hope that paints your imagination and feel free to try it, wasn't my cup of tea but everyone else loved it.\n\nThat atmosphere was lovely, the washrooms were clean, the service was wonderful and despite going with a big crowd for a going away party (15 people) - our waitress handled us perfectly. It was a good size place and we didn't feel like we overpowered the rest of the diners.", 4], ["Before my visit, I've watched multiple stories from Ozzy's Instagram. While waiting for my burger, I heard a distinct voice and I knew I recognized that self-generated hypeman voice.\n\nI came here on a Thursday evening; I've been holding off my visit because I wanted to go with my Ozzy's hypegals. They said \"better than Burgers and Fries\" and \"best in Toronto.\" It was up to me, who they refer to as a foodie, to make the final decision. \n\nI tried the \"Purple Rain\" and the \"BLT\". Both were hamburgers decorated with pineapple and guacamole, and with classic BLT toppings, respectively. \n\nAside from unique toppings, the foundations of the burgers, namely the bun and patty, met my expectations. The bun had a sweet taste and was soft to bite into, yet not too soft where it wouldn't be able to hold up the burger. The patty was juicy, seasoned, and compact. While it did not melt in my mouth or oozed at first bite like some of the patties do, the eating process was not as messy as I expected it to be. This specific location was quite small and can get packed during the winter months due to additional coats and bags. \n\nOverall, a great, quick burger joint with many accessible locations across Toronto and the GTA.", 5], ["Note:  This place is very, very casual.  You order at the counter, then they bring you the food once it's ready.  There is also some picnic tables outside.  I don't think there's a bathroom.\n\nI've had this place bookmarked for quite some time, but finally got to it today!\n\nWhenever I'm trying out a burger place, I literally order the most basic item because 1. It's usually the cheapest option and 2. It's easier for me to taste the patty without all the fancy toppings and sauces.\n\nI ordered 2 classic burgers ($6.99ea), 1 with combo (+$4.99 for fries/drink).  When you pay with a machine, it's quite close to the person so they'll probably see whether or not, and how much, you tip.  Food does take a while to roll out.\n\nVerdict?  Patty wasn't dry, but cooked through, some juice did come out from my first coupla bites.  Onions weren't quite caramelized, just sauteed, but flavourless.  Both patty and fries were bland.  Meat wasn't seasoned at all. \n\nOverall, it wasn't quite the 4-5* as per the ratings.  Overrated.", 2], ["Had the \"son of a bun\" burger here. \n\nThe burgers were all pretty good. Quality beef, fresh toppings...\n\nLicensed to sell alcohol? I don't think so, which is a drawback for me - I like to have a beer with my burger. \n\nWe came late and the staff were really pushy about us ordering in a hurry. They were clearly annoyed that we showed up. They would have been better to turn us away because it soured our experience. I also think they added a generous tip to our bill before handing over to me. $60 for three burgers (2 of which were with fries and a drink).", 3], ["I came here with friends tonight, and the burgers were some of the best I've tried. All of the specialty burgers looked great, but I ended up getting the classic cheeseburger with beef bacon. The bacon was cooked perfectly, not too crisp.

The onion rings were crisp but again lacked any seasoning.\n\nThe \"caramelized\" onions (on the patty) felt as if were taken off the pan very early in the process. Sorry, but caramelized onions are not white/pale and tasteless. \n\nBut as with everything subjective, to each their own I guess. We just would not be returning any time soon.\n\nService: The girl at the counter was friendly and service was quick-ish. \"Mr. Ozzy\" paid a visit to each and every table around but ours. Not that this matters to us but may matter to some.\n\nFood: freshly made but no real flavour. Tasteless and meh.", 2], ["We got the Classic Cheeseburger with a side of Cajun fries.

The Paradise City is absolutely massive but surprisingly didn't make as much of a mess as I thought it would. \n\nThe owner Ozzy is so full of life and really takes care of his customers.

In the warmer temperatures, the patio is open so there's extra seating outside. \n\nThe staff brought the burgers to our seats and they looked phenomenal. The vegetables looked fresh, the sauces were dripping, the cheese was perfectly melted - it was just a beautiful burger. My first bite of the Purple Rain was out of this world - the savouriness of the burger and the guacamole with the additional sweetness of the pineapple worked so well??!!! I took a bite of the Lamb burger and it was also really good but personally I preferred the Purple Rain! \n\nAlso, you know a burger is good when you need a GIANT STACK of napkins - every bite need a few napkins and in the end the mountain of napkins spoke for itself. \n\nDon't sleep on this place like I did for so long - get here now! Yes, even in the snowy conditions; it's so worth it. Can't wait to come back and try the double patty cheeseburger!", 5], ["Delicious burgers in a dope neighborhood!\n\nI went with the lamb burger which was packed with flavor.

We wanted both.", 5], ["During a visit to Kensington Market, we grabbed a bite to eat here at the recommendation of a friend. The woman taking our order was pleasant, but the wait time was pretty steep. Overall the food itself was okay. I ordered the poutine as I know it's a Canadian dish, but it was quite flavorless. The chicken sandwich was pretty good due to the sauce, but the steak sandwich was also relatively tasteless. It had everything to make it good (steak, peppers, lots of cheese), but it didn't really make an impression. The portions were good, but for the amount we paid ($40), it could have been better.", 3], ["What's not to love about Ozzy's? All the meat is high quality - beef is ground in-house.

Oh, also, it was huge. \n\nThe owner is jovial and warm, and he greets many people that come in; it's obvious that he's well-loved in the neighbourhood.

Not to mention, they use AAA Canadian beef which is ground fresh in house. \n\nMenu options will run you between $6-17 and there are quite a few choices, including vegan burgers and chicken or steak sandwiches. Sides are available and you can make anything into a combo for an extra $4.99.\n\nThe size of the diner is on the tiny side, but has enough space for about 16 patrons.

The hand formed patty is similar to a Burger's Priest patty, but where Priest is more smashed and compacted, Ozzy's is somehow both thicker and has an airy, more voluminous texture. The thickness and air pockets in the texture of the ground beef make for a burger that is soooo juicy and flavourful, cooked to absolute perfection - it's just so damn good.

Fries and onion rings were served ridiculously straight from the oil hot, which could be a good thing, but they were placed scalding hot right in front of children, which is a very bad and dangerous thing. They definitely need to rest these fried items before serving, should be a no brainer. There were no less than SEVEN staff just forming burgers in the back, which was impressive, but there was also a manager talking loudly on his phone who never greeted us or smiled or anything.

There are street tacos which are smaller in size for about $4 each and there are a few options like chicken, pork, beef, fish, and vegetarian. There are also gourmet tacos which are more of the stars of the menu here since they are bigger in size and there are many more options that the street tacos. Check out the menu as there are too many to name! The gourmet tacos range in price from around $7.99 - $9.00 depending on which one you order. There's something for everyone!\n\nWe ended up getting the combined chorizo and beef gourmet taco, as well as the braised pork and pork belly gourmet taco. Both were filling and delicious but the chorizo/beef taco was slightly more flavourful. Complimentary nachos are provided while you wait for your order as well. I also loved how this place has a salsa bar of about six different salsas with different levels of heat. We enjoyed each one but I particularly liked the creamy habanero one. This place is definitely worth a visit!", 4], ["One of my favourite Mexican restaurants in the city. The menu is mostly tacos but don't judge it's limited appeal.... the tacos are mouthwatering. I had the Pescado (fish) Street tacos and the Cochinita Gourmet Tacos. I would highly recommend the Cochinita Taco even if you're not into pork. The way the pork belly is cooked will have it melting in your mouth. Topped with the braised pork, this taco will leave you wanting to come back for more.\n\nThey also make all of their sauces in house which you'll find towards the back of the restaurant. There's quite a variety so ask the chefs nearby what they would recommend with the tacos you order.\n\nOh and fair warning, their taco sizes are huge especially their Gourmet Tacos. I had one Gourmet and one Street and I had a hard time finishing both. One Gourmet taco or two street tacos are probably a good portion size to have.", 4], ["Ordered the chicken and fish street tacos. Delicious. Probably the best tacos I've actually ever had. Very fresh, well seasoned, not oily. I'd give this place a 5/5 except service was slow and the restaurant is cramped and very cold. Our server was friendly. Washrooms were pretty clean. I'll come back for the tacos hands down.", 4], ["Two types of tacos:\nGourmet = two tacos with cheese in middle with loads of stuff inside. About $8 each. I'd say they are better and more complex than the latter, but at $8 is a bit steep.\n\nStreet: More simple one tortilla tacos. Still really good and about $4 each.\n\nI'd say in general the tacos are really good. \n\nThe service is quick, though when we were there, there was only one other person so the chef made ours immediately.\n\nThe complimentary chips were made on the spot, I saw her frying them while we were there in preparation. Though if you ask for more, it is another $1.50.\n\nThe sauces, and get yourself were delicious. I really liked they Mexican mud and the green one, forgot the name.", 4], ["This is, hands-down, the best mexican food place in Toronto! And I would know!  I live in Cuidad de Mexico, DF, and have travelled (with locals) pretty much every corner of Estados Unidos de Mexico!\n\nIn Toronto I've tried every single mexican restaurant in the core (no suburbs), including Los Colibris (high end), Caballito, Grand Electric (fusion), etc. etc.\n\nNONE of the above places are as good as this one. None, even the pricey ones! \n\nCinco is a very small restaurant and it gets really busy around brunch on weekends. They have a special brunch menu, but their regular one is also available.  The best items on the menu are tacos and they come in two varieties: specialty (lots of goodies) and regular (simple).  Specialty tacos are around $8 - two are enough for the average guy (150lbs), while the regular are around $5 and you'd probably need three to feel full. They also have a 'salsa bar' with different heat salsas - but they are all sooo goood!!!\n\nThe service is good but not servile.  When it gets busy sometimes they forget stuff (no free chips), but just remind them. The flavors of the pork belly and specialty pork are to die for!  I pity the people who don't eat the tastiest meat out there because they are missing on an amazing flavor and texture experience.  The chicken is also good, but the pork is waaay better.  In DF, pork Tacos al Pastor are the main street food, and here they are replicated almost exactly.\n\nNow a word for vegans (one nasty review down the screen, scroll down, you'll find it) - JUST KEEP MOVING!  This is not a restaurant for you!  I can't believe the lady who wrote the review ordered the tacos without meat AND without cheese!!!??? What's left? NOTHING - that's what!  The slow cooked meat with it's juices and mixed with the melted cheese, both soaking into the corny (see what I did there) tortilla is the essence of the food experience here.  During my time in Mexico I didn't meet a single local vegetarian/vegan.  That should tell you about the essence of the cuisine. \n\nDo yourself a favor and come to this restaurant and eat the dishes as they are written in the menu (no substitutions!) - your taste buds will thank you for hours.", 5], ["I had a wonderful lunch at Cinco during the Cinco de Mayo gourmet taco special. I arrived just before the lunch crowd and the server was very nice to explain all the specials to me. I ordered both Al pastor (pork) & Marisco (seafood) tacos. Both were very good, packed with flavour and very balanced. Pro tip, try all the different sauce in the back with the tacos. The extra heat makes a big difference.\nI will come again for their brunch specials.", 5], ["The decor, the food, the service and the hardworking owner and staff made this a place we will never forget. Tons of amazing salsa, super authentic food and a cozy home feeling. Top notch and a definite go-to!", 5], ["I honestly don't know why it took us so long to come and try Cinco! We've seen it on yelp and google reviews so many times but finally decided to try it for lunch on Sunday. Located in Roncesvalles is this homey Mexican restaurant. As you walk in, you are pleasantly greeted by the hostess and the chefs. Restaurant isn't too big, and they really only have a couple of tables, i think with the largest table seating 8? Menu is also fair in size, but they have Sunday brunch if you're interested in eggs rather than tacos! We came here specifically for their tacos and salsa bar! \n\nHostess/waitress was great in explaining their menu to us. They have 2 types of tacos: Gourmet and Street taco. Gourmet tacos are two tortillas stuffed with cheese in between and then their taco ingredients on top. Street tacos are your typical tacos but with only 1 tortilla. We opted to try one of each. I had the seafood gourmet taco (fish, squid and shrimp) with slaw on top and also the beef street taco. The beef street taco is AMAZING. So flavourful and filled with onions and cilantro on top!! The seafood gourmet taco was good but was nothing overly special in my opinion. My hubby got the rotisserie chicken taco and that was SOOO good. I was first skeptical because rotisserie chicken and tacos together didn't sound appealing, but the sauce, the ingredients, the toppings all combined so well together. Mind you they are not stingy on their meats. They give you a heaping amount and you get really full after one gourmet taco!! The waitress also recommended their churros as they are homemade and lightly dusted with cinnamon. We tried the chocolate filled churro and it was sooooo goood. it comes out pipping hot and with chocolate oozing out. \n\nService was also fast and great. They also serve free nacho chips and a help yourself salsa bar which was fun! They had salsa ranging from mild to really spicy. and also had this jalapeno guac that was my fav. I can't wait to return and try their other options!!", 5], ["First time at Cinco and we were not disappointed. Lots of great things on the menu, so we will definitely be coming back to try more. Also, they have a great salsa bar with a variety of options worth trying. Lively atmosphere, but the service was just a bit slow.\nFor this first visit, we started with the lime margaritas (FYI that these are frozen, but very good) and the chicken taquitos (good; the shells felt a little tough but all the fresh toppings made up for it).\nThen we got the Pollo con mole gourmet taco (very good!) and the enchiladas (3 per order, we couldn't finish it). Trying a different salsa with each bite gives each a unique flavour profile. The morita salsa was my favourite, and the jerk flavoured one is good too.\n\nThey also do brunch, and the menu says their cocktail menu is coming.", 4], ["What an absolute gem! Had been meaning to write a review and have been here three times so far. The food is incredible. I have Mexican food in LA more often than not and that stuff is amazing ... so I'm always sceptical about what I have over here actually being good. This place is equal to most of my favourites and superior to a few others I have been to over in LA which is saying a lot. \n\nI really love the diversity of the plates, like whatever you order the sides not only compliment the food but they are plentiful in choice. They even have a salsa bar. \n\nMy only tip would be if you love salsa as passionately as I do ...bring a little plate to the bar so you can load it up with the little salsa cups. \n\nLong live delicious food!", 5], ["[Good]\nFood - Can't really go wrong with any of the taco selections here.  Go for one gourmet and one street taco to get a sampling for both that should fill you up adequately for lunch.  The pork in the Al Pastor was a little dry but flavours were good.  The fish was great as well.\n\nSalsa bar - I really like this unique feature.  There's a selection of different salsas that you can scoop from.  Try them all and decide which ones you want to add to your tacos to enhance the flavours to your liking.  There's such a good variety here from creamy to mild to super spicy.  It's good to try them with the complementary tortilla chips while waiting for your food.\n\nService - Service is prompt and friendly.  It was our first time and the waiter gladly suggested items on the menu for us and also directed us to the salsa bar.\n\n[Worth it?]\nIt's pretty good food for a decent price.  I say the food here is better than Grand Electric so if you're a fan there, you definitely need to try here.  I'd come back to try their rotisserie chicken.", 4], ["Popped into this place around noon and it was absolutely packed. Had a quick look at the menu and thought it was quite nice. We were doing a little food tour on Roncy so didn't want to consume a full meal before we had a chance to sample all of the beautiful offering that the local shops had on offer. \n\nWe walked the stretched and managed find find a few small things to munch on. \n\nAfter the walk back, I suggested we get some tacos at Cinco. \n\nWas provided some awesome tortilla chips at no cost. They had a wide selection of salas at no additional cost as well which was very nice. \n\nBefore I forget, the waitress was exceptional. She had notice that we had popped in earlier and was surprised to see us back a couple hours later. \n\nThe food was spectacular. I ordered the mixed pork 'gourmet' taco - consisting of pork belly, loin and some other delicious ingredients ~$8 and change. My SO ordered the three for $10 and got the fish (2) and beef (1). \n\nQuite honestly, the food here is delicious and worth the wait. Yes we were there off peak hours and so not everything would have been prepared quickly - so there was a bit of a wait - but it was really delicious (almost as good as Seven Lives in Kensington Market. \n\nThe decor was also very nice and just generally a great experience.", 4], ["Amazing lunch specials. They have a very good salsa, you will be impressed with the flavors. Really enjoyed it, will be back and definitely recommend.", 5], ["Excellent Mexican food, great prices, service is amazing ! So happy we had dinner at Cinco and can't wait to go back. Fish tacos and calamari were our favourites. Churros were delish !", 5], ["It's tough for me to give out five stars but this place is just so great and to top it off (and earn the 5th star) is good value. The flavour in the meat is amazing. Our group had cochinita pibil, beef & carnitas, and fish. Everyone was super happy. Their salsas, a key measure of any Mexican restaurant, are great. \n\nBest tacos I've had in Toronto, one of the best spots on Roncesvalles. Can't wait to return. It'll be a Ronny staple for our family.", 5], ["The hype is totally worth it..the gourmet tacos are awesome , authentic . And rotisserie chicken was very flavourful and meat fell of the bone .. and last but not least the churro stuffed with chocolate is a must have .. he place is small /quaint and casual and feels like a taste Mexico .. make sure you make reservations", 5], ["Terrific taco lunch today!! Excellent food, staff, and ambience. Will definitely return.", 5], ["I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.\n\nFood: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. \nI left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. \n\nService & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.\n\nPrice: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos. This restaurant is a welcomed addition to Roncesvalles!", 4], ["First time visiting this neighbourhood space after watching them renovate for quite some time and eagerly waiting for their opening.\n\nWe arrived fairly late in their service and they were happy to seat us. The interior is very comfortable, and it might make a great casual date spot (although they really need a liquor license). The service was very friendly, and tour server was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu.\n\nWe were informed that they were unfortunately out of the gourmet seafood (marisco) taco, so I ordered the gourmet vegetarian tacos, while my partner ordered a sampling of the smaller street tacos. All of the ingredients were high quality, and everything seemed fairly fresh. We also appreciated the salsa bar and enjoyed sampling several varieties. We ultimately weren't blown away by the tacos. They were all tasty, but a little bit more subdued than many of the other tacos you might find in the city, with fairly standard toppings. Our sides of chips and guacamole and fried potatoes were both quite good. Prices were reasonable and the portions are substantial. \n\nA nice restaurant, but I have to admit that a liquor license would improve the experience substantially. This is a cozy casual place I would have loved to hang out and enjoy a drink and a few tacos at over an hour or two, and while the tacos were good, I felt there was just a slight missed opportunity here.", 4], ["Amazing food! Love it! Great service! Great tacos. The fish tacos and the quesadillas are really good", 5], ["Delicious tacos, the salsas are amazing too! You can get your own selection of unlimited salsas, they taste like real Mexican ones. I recommend it. The service is on the slow side but they make it up with the delicious tacos! Price wise is so so, $8.00 for one taco is a bit much.. they are good though!", 5], ["I've been here 4 times now, and I really want to love this place. But unfortunately, my experiences have been underwhelming overall. We always order the vegetarian tacos with no cheese, a side of fries and refried beans. Although we have asked that they add a little guac to the tacos in place of the cheese, they always just send an order of guac ($4 for a tiny ramekin, eek!) and then charge us for it, not mentioning it. At first I chalked it up to a language barrier. The second time I specifically said, \"please add the guac instead of the cheese, but not a full order.\" Again, we received a full order, and a $4 charge on the bill, which I disputed and the manager/owner reluctantly removed, saying he'd do it \"this time.\" You would think that restaurants would be accommodating, to keep customers coming back, but I guess not. So the third and fourth times I went, I didn't even bother asking about the miniscule amount of guac, but instead just bit the bullet and ordered a side of guac, along with the refried beans. Last time we went, despite saying \"no cheese\" on any of the food, the refried beans arrived with cheese all over the top, so we had to send it back. They were happy to swap it out but come on. Pay attention.\n\nThey offer free chips and salsa while you wait for your food, so last time I asked for a few more (as we had salsa leftover). The waitress brought five more chips and later charged us $1.50 for them. Didn't mention it, just added the charge to the bill. When I asked about it at the end, she basically shrugged and said that's the way it is. Despite the mixup with the cheese on the refried beans, the fact we didn't have any cheese on our tacos, etc., they still had to gouge us on the five tortilla chips. Nice.\n\nOn top of this, the tacos are nowhere near as delicious as they were in the beginning. They have changed the tortillas to blue corn, which have a stronger taste, and the veg filling in the tacos is more bland now. Maybe it's tastier with cheese? I will never know.\n\nOverall, this place is mediocre at best, and the service is hit and miss. On top of that, the place leaves your clothes smelling like the food, for days. I had to wash my winter coat because it smelled like taco meat.\n\nDespite this place being in my neighbourhood, I don't think I'll be going back here unless I just want some fries as a quick snack.", 2], ["The tacos were fantastic! Some of the best I have had in Toronto. You can see them cooking everything fresh and the chef even recommended certain salsas. Gourmet Choken Mole Poblano was heaven.

Very friendly staff.", 5], ["Authentic, no frills, no improvisations- just a straight reminder of Mexican street food at it's best. All ingredients are actually shipped directly from Mexico. Must try!", 5], ["We went there for dessert & had the churros. We tried both the caramel & chocolate. I liked them both but my friend preferred the chocolate. The only thing is you get 3 little pieces for $6.99 which I think is on the pricey side. I don't think I would come back to get it for that price.", 3], ["My friend and i were exploring the Roncy neighborhood on our way to High Park. We were looking to eat something chill, fresh, and not too expensive. We walked pass this Mexican joint and went right back in when we saw how cute the restaurant was and loved the chill vibe! Nachos come to your table complimentary, get the quac, you won't regret it. Selection of free salas at the back for your tacos. We tried the fish, chicken and pork street tacos. Super amazing and fresh and the taco was super loaded! Full off of 2 tacos. Would absolutely recommend this place. Perhaps the best tacos in the city, and I've tried a lot of tacos...", 5], ["Although I went here for dinner a few weeks ago and they did not have any chicken ready, I was happy enough to try other items in the menu and I was not disappointed! Good, authentic Mexican street tacos. I was happy to see they use two tortillas for each taco, not common at many other taco joints around Toronto.\nThe salsa station is a great touch and good way to flavour your tacos to your liking. \nChurros for dessert were delicious and a great way to end the meal. \nWill be back for sure!", 4], ["The tacos (both street and gourmet) ... and the rotisserie chicken. Tired the mango jalape\u00f1o and coconut pineapple sauces - both so delicious. A large dinner for 4 with half a chicken leftover came out to about $20 per person. My favourite new taco spot.

We will definitely be regulars. Looking forward to them getting a liquor license.", 5], ["Live in the area and finally came in to give it a try.

For the place being very small and quaint unfortunately the server seemed to be unexperienced and all over the place confused leaving us with no drinks for an extended period of time and as well as never being checked in on to see how it was going. Unfortunately I believe the food can be great but without good service it's not enjoyable.", 2], ["Awesome hidden gem at the south side of Roncesvalles.

Just saying.", 5], ["I came here for their omakase and I thought it was okay.

This was pretty good considering it was shared between 2 people. Normally it's around $100/head at other places but the quality here is not compromised. \n\nThe upgraded lobster did have a lot of batter on it as it was deep fried with (what seemed like thousand island sauce) a sauce on top of it. The soup came in a small container and two small cups to refill which was nice and the flavour was great. \n\nWe were sitting on the other side of the restaurant (expansion unit) which was more updated and they prepared a small birthday cake for my wife and sang her a song as well as hand prepped sign with her name on it (very nice touch). They dimmed the lights as well which was also nice.\n\nIn the end, they also gave us a $10 coupon for up to a year to use which was totally unexpected and made us feel like valued customers. \n\nDefinitely recommend this place if you're looking for quality without paying the premium of decor and downtown locations.", 4], ["74/100\n\nIf you're looking for a quick traditional sushi fix, Aoyama has been in Scarborough for years. I personally find the shari a little too neutral-flavoured for me but the seafood quality is fine for the price and the nigiri is well made. \n\nIt's a fairly small establishment with cutesy washrooms and kind service. We were offered a complimentary matcha service that I enjoyed, the cooler weather of November means a hot drink is always welcome. \n\nSome of my friends actually just order the standard sushi omakase course ($110) for themselves, but it is definitely shareable between two people no problem.

Usually I hate it because it's super briney and the sushi rice only sort of dampens that but this uni was excellent. Not too briney and it was actually palatable going in. I was suggested to wash it down with sake but I tried it and it wasn't my jam. Dunking it with soy sauce was good but I wish I didn't have to dunk so much.\n\nTheir mango cheesecake was BOMB.

The seafood soup tasted good however there might be too much msg in it since I kept drinking water until next day. For me, sushi tasted okay. I wonder if it's because at the end of the day the sashimi became not so fresh? The shrimp tasted rubbery, the color of toro looked a little bit weird, so were the the shapes of sushi....I am no expert in sushi but TBH for me their sushi is definitely not worth going back again (the lobster is lol) it's only my opinion but I did have high expectation in their sushi with the set cost us nearly $170.", 3], ["During the weekend, Aoyama offers a \"sushi set upgraded weekend special\" ($125) that comes with a more sushi and luxurious appetizers, compared to their regular option. To begin, there's a sharing platter of small eats containing chawanmushi (a savoury egg custard), lobster tempura, yakitori skewers, other small nibbles, and a pot of seafood consomm\u00e9.   \nl\nNormally, chawanmushi is served hot. At Aoyama, it's cold so ends up being denser and almost the consistency of a savoury flan. The temperature and jellied soup takes some getting used to, but it tasted good, the dashi (?) flavours seeping through. Finishing it with a teacup of the umami-filled seafood consomm\u00e9 is a nice combination.\n\nPlump pieces of lobster tempura is dressed with the all-colour-no-heat spicy mayo. Nonetheless, the lobster was cooked nicely, it just needed a bit of salt or something else to dip it into. Surrounding the dish were pods of dry edamame and tempura burdock root that was cold but tasty to nibble on.\n\nWhat makes yakitori skewers delicious is when they're hot off the grill and you can smell and taste the smoky caramelized glaze. In the platter, the chicken and scallion yakitori were cold (having been brought over from the other store) so the chicken became hard and the sauce congealed and lumpy. Really, Aoyama should consider replacing these with a starter that doesn't need to be hot.\n\nSomething to consider when you make a reservation: what is important about the meal for you? Is it hot food or a comfortable sitting environment? While the VIP room is spacious and has an ambiance of a brightly lit piano lounge, there isn't a kitchen so food is transported over in a non-insulated metal container arriving lukewarm to cold. To get the best of both worlds, you'll want to order cold items when sitting in the VIP area.\n\nLuckily, the huge plate of sushi that's part of the set menu can withstand the frigid journey. That evening, it contained two types of tuna, the fattier toro and the regular blue fin variety; sweet soft pieces of unagi (barbequed eel); surprisingly clean pieces of aji (horse mackerel) that's further topped with tons of ginger and green onions; tried and true kampachi,  salmon, and salmon maki; a decent take on tamago (egg) that had the flavours but not the lovely layers; as well as generous portions of hotate (Hokkaido scallop), ebi (raw shrimp), and uni (sea urchin).", 3], ["After reading the reviews was very excited to try out this restaurant.  When we got there the menu was very limited but we were able to get a last minute reservation.

My daughter requested an avocado roll and they more than accommodated the request.\n\nWe ordered the sushi set omakase which was meant for two people.  It was served with soup that you can pour into these tiny bowls and had a bit of a kick to it, definitely not your traditional miso soup.  They also served some edamame, chicken yaki tori and another dish.\n\n\nThe main dish came out and the sushi was fantastic but for everything we got the price was a bit steep.  I really enjoyed the uni and some of the fish was flown in from Japan.  The time it took for everything to come out was relatively quick.  \n\nThe reason I only gave it a three was the price point and the ambience.

You'll definitely be hungry after eating it. My friend had a piece of scale in his sashimi.\n\nThe rolls were meh, not worth the price at all. I've had better for half the price. The rolls were so loose that it just fell apart and it didn't look that great. Didn't taste great either. \n\nThe funniest thing is my friend ordered the salmon teriyaki for $13, it was literally a piece of fish lol, we didn't know it didn't even come with rice... So that was that. We all left hungry and wondered if we should go to kfc next door :P. We ended up going for a midnight meal instead after our next activity.\n\nThe service is pretty good, the waitress doesn't speak English well though but they're very nice.

And I would say they were pretty spot on.  First off this place is small, so reservations are a must, especially on a weekend.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgable of the days specials.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are craving real japanese sushi without having to go downtown.", 4], ["I used to come here regularly and really enjoyed it. But over the recent years, prices have gone up a lot, yet quality declined.\n\nWe ordered the sashimi house plate for $69 and everything was fresh especially the prawn and scallop.

At the price they were charging, you'd think they would give you better fish.\n\nWe were still hungry after the items we ordered so we got a grilled Hokke and ATC roll that took THIRTY minutes to arrive. The ATC roll was so ugly, there were finger indents in the rice like the person who made the sushi was angry at it. It was so poorly rolled! And nothing special either. Sushi Bong quality but double the price. Very disappointed.\n\nWe spent over $100 for dinner tonight and the experience was extremely underwhelming.\n\nWe had their omakase last year for my husband'd birthday, and even then it was not great, or good. Again, very common sashimi fish that was not worth the money we paid. Might as well go to Taro's Fish.\n\nTons of other authentic Japanese restaurants options now. Will never spent another hard earned dollar at this establishment.

So naturally for her Bday, I took her here to celebrate!  If you're thinking of coming here, always make a reservation.  We came on a Wednesday and every table was reserved when we got there.  Chances are you will be turned away if you don't make a reservation in advance.\n\nAoyama has a wide assortment to choose from on their menu.  We settle on the Omakase sushi set.  According to the menu, they only serve 5 of these per day so we were in luck when we ordered it.  We ordered a salmon for teriyaki for our little ones as they don't eat raw fish yet. \n\nThe sushi set comes with an appetizer which consists of edamame, an egg dish and some chicken yakitori skewers.  All three were pretty good and a nice setup into the sushi after.  The omakase set came later and it was laid out beautifully.  It also tasted as good as it looked.  You don't need to be a sushi expert to know the taste is a cut above your ordinary all you can eat variety. The meal itself was very enjoyable.\n\nPrice wise is the only gripe I have.  The omakase set was $89.  So it's 20 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of a salmon roll for almost a hundred dollars.  Value wise, it's a little off putting for me.  I probably won't be ordering it again if were to come back.  The sushi was excellent, but the big eater in me thinks what other things I can get for $100.  The salmon teriyaki was $13 and didn't even come with rice as well.\n\nAs with all Japanese owned businesses, the service was fantastic and always on point.  I'm never disappointed by service by a Japanese owned restaurant and Aoyama keeps up with the streak.\n\nI would totally recommend Aoyama for a special event for sushi fans.

My favorited would definitely be the ootoro, scallop, monk fish and lobster sushi.

A course special salad!\" I was surprised that this was the most memorable salad ever.\n\nUsuzukuri: Was ok, a new experience, but somehow it was not for me.\n\nThe sashimi consisted of salmon, tuna that was either maguro or medium toro or somewhere in between, sweet shrimp, and what may have been kanpachi (forgot). Overall decent, but I sort of expected more exotic variety (some Uni, Giant Clam, or Scallops) like on the omakase sushi set.\n\nButter fried Lobster and Shrimp tempura were very good.\n\nThe sushi was over all decent (see picture), but I somehow expected more exotic variety. This time there was Uni, but still not on par with the omakase sushi set.\n\nThe final was a choice of dessert, and I chose the black bean ice cream. It was also good.\n\nThe Verdict:\nVery good food overall, but I feel the omakase sushi set is in general a bit better in quality (come on, there's toro!)\n\nThis visit for this 65 dollar omakase course, 9/10 for quality, 9/10 for the service, 8/10 for the value. 8.5/10 overall (not an average). \n\nPlease see my previous review on the omakase sushi set.

We especially liked the egg custard for its unique taste and great texture. The other 2 were average. We were also served a seafood (scallop and shrimp) soup in a cute kettle to be poured into shot glasses to enjoy, which tasted excellent. After that, the sushi came.

The female manager/owner here is a joke and absolutely has 0 customer service skills.

We already told her they made a mistake bringing the omakase's first course, why would you even have made the 2nd course??

To make matters worse, she said \"i have done nothing wrong, we don't need you to pay and don't come back.\" We paid what we ordered, cause sure as hell we aren't letting her think we came for a free meal.

Sounds so but it makes for such a fabulous cocktail and it's like magic because it's basically clear with just a hint of yellow. \nFlowers for Bae was lovely and Titanic was such a fun cocktail right down to the garnish of jackfruit chips.\n\nYou need to go. Get the cocktails and try a bunch of them!", 5], ["Full disclosure, I came for the happy hour and it was so worth it! \n\nThe cocktails are definitely all on the sweeter side, with a big emphasis on Asian flavours! The best was the Garden Geisha, which was a nice and light drinks with floral and cucumber notes, the monkey see, monkey do, which was a nice twist on a gin and tonic and not too sweet, the Yokozuna's G&T was a little sweeter, but had a beautiful oolong undertone that was super original, Cameron's kick was reminiscent of a Shirley Temple, and definitely on the sweeter side, but enjoyable the way juice is enjoyable! \n\nThe Baos were tasty and a nice spin with the classic filling, and the crunchy bun (personally I still like the steamed white bun versions the best), but these were a super tasty spin on a classic. The octopus was super tasty as well with lots of different sauces, and perfectly cooked! \n\nI would definitely come back for the drinks and a snack! The happy hour cocktails are a hit! PRO TIP: the bar for happy hour opens 30 minutes before the kitchen if you want to maximize your happy hour cocktail time!", 4], ["Great Asian Fusion restaurant with cool decor. Loved the Korean Fried Chicken. The other main dishes we ordered were good as well. The desserts could use some work.", 4], ["Really like this place  Try the Peking duck if you get a chance, but to ensure you get one call ahead of time to reserve one. Everything I've tried here is really good including the 20oz steak and we always order the fun gao :)", 5], ["I've been here a number of times and it keeps getting better and better. Last night my gfs and I came for after work dinner and drinks and were seated right away without a reservation (you can usually find some kind of seating without reso for small groups but may have to settle for sitting at the bar). Amazing dishes here - beautiful presentation, quality, and FLAVOUR. Wow! Can never complain about a lack of flavour at R&D! \n\nMy personal favourites are the mapo tofu and vegetarian bibimbap. The mapo tofu they use is crispy and the sauce is perfect. Not your traditional, average mapo tofu. As with every dish here, expect an Asian- western, R&D only spin :) If you're extra hungry, get the bibimbap because it is packed with vegetables with a runny yolk egg on top. My favourite part about this dish is that they actually use black rice. Usually at Korean restaurants they use purple rice, which is like, 80% white rice and 20% black rice. Black rice contains more antioxidants, protein, and fiber than even brown rice, so is healthier for you.\n\nThe seafood chow mein was also a winner. The sauce again was perfect, on the sweeter side. The seafood pieces were a bit small, but otherwise another large tasty, filling main. If you like seafood, try the tuna tartare on shrimp chips. It's a smaller, appetizer size dish, but the tuna is so well marinated and flavourful, a must try. Finally, we loved the sous vide kalbi (Korean bbq beef short ribs)! Comes with 6 pieces of tender, juicy, well marinated ribs on a small bed of marinated kale, purple cabbage, and Korean rice cakes. \n\nThe drinks are $7 before 7 o'clock, so be sure to take advantage of that. \n\nLast but not least, the service is always wonderful. Why are all the staff so photogenic here? Lol. They also split our bill and even remembered to add our drinks separately to the correct person - hey, a lot of restaurants nowadays no longer offer to split bills. \n\n100% will be back", 5], ["Came here with a group of friends, the waiter came and explained the menu to us about what was the favorites. If you want the Peking duck you must reserve it in advance. We called a week before to make the reservation for the duck. We order a number of dishes that included peking duck , fried rice , korean fried chicken , tar tar and the lo mai gai. Overall after trying everything, the duck was quite delicious with the baos. However its 80$ just for the duck and when you order additional baos it costs more. The service is pretty good at the restaurant however the price of each dish is quite steep considering what is given. This was a one time visit for me, glad that I tried it but will be looking for new places around Toronto. The bill worked out to about 70$ a person.", 3], ["Full disclosure this review reflects - coming here during dinner service ($33) during Winterlicious 2019. My girlfriend likes MasterChef, so she's been dying to check this place out. Let's get straight into it. \n\n1. Decor - hip and trendy, hipster faux Chinese - with some Mao's cladding the walls. Pretty chic!\n2. Kitchen - open! In our visit we peered in and saw Eric Chong working the line\n3. Menu - Winterlicious set of 3. I had the lettuce wraps (a little spicy, but good!), seared salmon belly (silky like butter, a little salty for my taste), and apple tart (an instant classic). Delicious!\n4. Beverages - even during the promo they had drink specials which is uncommon. $7 cocktails - I got the garden geisha (nicely balanced, sweet with a light bitter finish)\n5. Value - Definitely good value, great ability to taste a bit of everything!", 4], ["Great Atmosphere and Wonderful Food! \n\nMy partner and I wanted to try R&D ever since we found out they serve Peking duck. We made reservations for Friday evening, specifying that we were interested in the duck. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated at the back portion of the restaurant, with a nice view of the open kitchen. Service was slightly slow, as it appeared only two waiters were working in the area (serving larger groups). \n\nWe ordered several cocktails, mainly Sake based, as well as some appetizers. The tuna tartare & CSB were really good. The tartare was slightly over seasoned--a little too acidic for my liking.\n\n\nNow for the duck. The servers brought it to us prior to carving and explained how it is cooked. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium rare with crispy skin. I am not the biggest fan of duck (due to the fat content), but my partner loved every bit of it. The dish is definitely meant for at least four people. We took half of the duck home. \n\nThe overall experience was great. There are certain points, such a slower service and slightly over seasoned food, which stop me from giving R&D five starts. I will be returning for more great cocktails and some fusion cuisine.", 4], ["Got the sweet and sour pork which was yummy but didn't significantly wow me. It was a plate full of meat! I was hoping to pair the sweet and sour pork with some sides but there was only a tiny bit of coleslaw on the top. I eventually had to order white rice infused with coconut to go along with the pork.\n\nThe rice was sooooo good. One of the best rice over ever had! Very fine and coconutty. \n\nI can't complain when there's a lot of pork but I suggest them to add some white rice on the side. \n\nAll in all, I didn't thought the sweet and sour pork was mediocre but I will definitely try their chicken and waffles next time!", 3], ["I'll keep this short and sweet. 1. Great, relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for lounging with drinks. 2. The food was okay. I was expecting more and left disappointed. 3. Service was okay - the restaurant wasn't busy and I had trouble finding  our server. \n\nI don't say this often, but the flavors were too strong. My drinks were over spiced and too aromatic , some dishes were too salty, sweet or fishy. I would have preferred the flavors to be toned down a little bit.", 3], ["Nice decor and great place to have nice chats over dinner  with friends. The food is generally Hong Kong/ Chinese and Western fusion. My friend ordered their version of the gin and tonic and was really good. The BBQ Pork Buns were quite good too but the rest of the food we ordered were just so so. Maybe because I am from Hong Kong and I know how those dishes are supposed to taste, it just didn't quite impress me.", 3], ["Me and my boyfriend went there for the first time and we had their Winterlicious menu plus Madai sashimi.. \n\nThe service was good, our server was really friendly, and see he didn't come to over table and ask how the food is or if everything is okay! I LOVE IT! I hate it when the server keeps coming to the table and asking how the food is, and sometime even before we have the chance to taste it.. If we have an issue with the food we will definitely call you over for that.. So that was a plus for me.\n\nIn terms of the food quality, overall it was good. I can understand that the quality of the Winterlicious is just so-so since they are mass-produced.. For entree I ordered the Japchae, and it was mushy... However, I felt like the Madai sashimi was a bit too ginger-y... The spice from the ginger overpowered the freshness from the fish.. I was a bit disappointed on that..\n\nOverall I liked this experience, and I would probably come back for their regular menu.. Plus, I would love to have a picture taken with the head chef Eric!! He was too busy tonight", 4], ["This place was unreal.\n\nFirst off, the ambiance is unreal. It's a dope bar with intimate seating. The vibe is very cocktail bar-esk.\n\nWe started off with a cider (collective arts), and the CSB. The bao was stuffed with some delicious savoury roast pork, and stopped with Mexican sugar.\n\nNo lie, these buns were the BEST bao I've ever had. Ever. Hands down. They were reminiscent of The Tim Ho Wan, but honestly better. If you come here, you could get JUST these and be happy.\n\nNext up was Grandpa's Fun Guo. Chicken, truffle and bamboo stuffed dumplings. They were good but very heavy on the truffle, so if that's not your flavour you might not love them.\n\nFinally, we got the short ribs with duck fat sou vied potatoes. They were tender and delicious with a slight korean flavour. They sat atop rice cakes, and some vegetables. Amazing. The potatoes were fatty, and sweet, and sticky. A great pairing.\n\nGive this place a shot. We didn't get it but next time we're going to try the duck. It looked amazing.", 5], ["Given the reputation of the chefs and the many Instagram photos of the food, I was expecting great things at R&D! To be honest, the good was hit or miss. It was food, but not spectacular. We ordered off a combination of the summerlicious and the a-la-carte menu.. the mapo tofu was spectacular and probably the best thing we ordered. The fried rice, with  lap cheong and tilapia was also good and the beef tataki was beautifully done! The Mac and cheese, supposedly with satay sauce and lacked the wow factor and the shumai was also ordinary. Desserts were the saving grace, I could eat their Korean pancake everyday! The third star was given for the fantastically attentive service with the right amount of banter and the deliciously innovative cocktails! The best part of my evening was the oolong tea, lavender infused G&T. All in all, a fun experience! Go for the cocktails!", 3], ["I really really wanted to like this place! After walking past its doors at least a hundred times, I've always envisioned this place to be like the Hogwarts 9 3/4 platform where inside was a magical place with really really super tasty food.  #Gryffindor4Life\n\nH*ll to the no! While nothing really technically \"bad\", nothing is really \"good\" either. Full disclosure, they were trying out their new menu, so maybe it was an off night? I apologize if i can't remember all the fancy pants names of the items. \n\nFood: \n\nTuna Tartare & Cerviche: Best dishes of the night. Great start! Tuna almost reminds you like a poke. Keep on ordering these! \n\nPork & Bao: This is where things started to go south. Bao was good, but the pork was a tad dry, leaving you with a stringy feel to it. \n\nChow Mein with Shrimp?: tasty, but nothing next level. Great flavour development and there were bites of something sour that woke up the entire dish. The only grippe I would have is that there is no \"wok hay\" (essence of wok?) that usually comes with great chow mein. Shrimp was cooked perfectly. I kinda felt like asking them if they had XO sauce?\n\nOctopus with asian Chimichurri, miso paste on eggplant: Let's start with the octopus, apparently it was first steamed and then seared for some Malliard browning goodness. That's cool, except it really over done and lost one of the key elements of amazing asian fare-\"freshness\" and it just turns out to be rubbery mess. The other components however were OK? \n\nFried chicken and waffles: Chicken thats been brined and has heavy traces of five spice and apparently waffles with condensed milk? Pros: Chicken is crunchy and crisp. Cons: the five spice is really overpowering. Once you put the 2 parts together, you realize there's nothing bridging the two distinct elements together and you really just have a piece of fried chicken and a waffle. \n\nService: It was orite. I just don't think they cared. After the \"chow mein\" came the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Yay! Except that the chow mein had so much excess sauce that we had to pour it out into an empty bowl before we tried the waffles. \n\nOverall: great place to lounge out and impress, but if you're like me, where the stars need to be greater or equal to the dollar sign on the review, I would stay away.", 1], ["Kind of expensive. R&D is the kind of restaurant where you really need to know what you'll be getting before ordering. They have some great dishes and some that are just so so. CRISPY PORK BELLY is must to have. Skip VENISON CHILI SPRING ROLLS. SCALLOP CEVICHE is my favourite. LAKSA SEAFOOD CHOW MEIN is nothing special. BEEF TATAKI is excellent. The wine selection is limited. Notice it's cheaper to order wine in glass than in bottle.", 3], ["To start off, the service was horrendous. We had a reservation for 8 guests and we had one extra person show up. We asked the server for our table if she could bring another chair and but instead of providing any solutions - she merely told us that we had a set reservation, there were no extra chairs and we could not block the aisle. That was our mistake, having an extra person so we let that go and squished into the spot. Then, when she asked us what drinks we wanted, we asked for some water whilst we looked at the drink menu and she merely gestured to a water jug at the center of the table and said \"the water is right in front of you.\" Even though we had no glasses in which you pour said water into. The entire night, our multiple servers were either curt or rude. \n\nWe thought that the food would redeem the restaurant as it was started by some celebrity masterchef. We were quite mistaken. The food was mediocre at best - overpriced and all the \"fusion\" dishes were just covered in hoisin sauce and were much too salty. We tried the following dishes (ordered for 3 of us at the table).\n\n-Crispy Pork Belly Bao (so-so, very fatty and didn't have much flavour, but at least wasn't salty)\n-Grandpa's Fun Gao (tasted bland but we were glad it wasn't overpowered by any sauces as it was steamed)\n-Beef Tataki (probably the best thing we had all night though the meat quality was tough but the flavours were good)\n-Kalbi Pork Short Ribs (the sauce that was used to glaze the meat wasn't thoroughly cooked and had a weird mushy consistency. The rice cakes and apple sauce on the bottom however was very good)\n-Stone Bowl Bimbimbap (worst dish of the night - I have absolutely nothing good to say about this dish)\n\nWould not recommend to anyone.", 1], ["I have used Yelp for years but never had a reason to create an account until now.\n\nI finally caved in to my girlfriend and took her here. I should have known better when I walked in and saw the place empty except for maybe 2 tables at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. The decor was nice though, and the staff was enthusiastic. I had no idea it opened by the winner of Masterchef Canada, so when he mentioned that, I got pretty excited.\n\nWe ordered 3 items to start: grandpas' fung guo (recommended by the waiter), ceviche, and the curry. The lobster chow mein was also recommended, but I wasn't too hungry nor was I too keen on spending $25 on a tapas dish. \n\nThe fung guo was bland. There is nothing more to say about it. At $8 for 3 pieces, I expected it to taste better than the frozen dim sum I can buy at the grocery store.\n\nThe ceviche was disgusting. My girlfriend always orders ceviche if it's on a menu, so I have had my fair share. This was just diced up shrimp and scallops on top of guac. It was too sour for us to even eat half. \n\nThe curry was pretty good. My dining partner thought it was too salty but I thought it was decent compared to the garbage that was my 2 previous dishes. She also ordered a cosmo which she did like though.\n\nOverall, the bill came to $70+ for 3 tapas dishes and a drink. I had to eat again a couple of hours later. $70+ for a snack is ridiculous given the quality of the food. There are so many better similar restaurants out there, and this one seems to be putting random ingredients together and calling itself \"Asian Fusion\" in attempt to cash in on the hype right now. \n\nIt could be possible I just didn't order the \"right\" items, but I will never find out.", 1], ["I've been to this place twice.

We had so much fun!! \n\nOur server this time, Christina, is very attentive, funny, and professional. She is also very patience with our table and took the time to explain and suggest the food.

Their chow mein could be improved tho...and their duck....i could not even begin to describe it!!! It is the \"best duck in the city!!\" And dont even get me to start on their csb....i could eat that pork bun everyday!!\n\nMoving on to drinks...their wine list is terrible!!!!

Some gave it raving reviews and others not so much.  I wanted to see for myself what exactly this resto had to offer so my husband and I came here for lunch yesterday.  \n\nWe ordered: \n1) Grandpa's Fun Guo - Flavourful is the word I would use to describe it.  Expensive for 3 pieces of dim sum (esp when down the street you can get it for 2 dollars).  But I do have to give it credit, this is probably the best thing we ate while here.  My husband felt that the cashews/ nuts needed to be a bit chunkier to give it more of a texture.  Otherwise it was fine. \n\n2) Poutine - Not good.  It's essentially cubed potatoes and sweet potatoes topped with some cheese, silken tofu and some sauce.  The potatoes were inconsistently cooked - some were clearly underdone.  The flavour profile is interesting....it's not spicy, not savoury, not sweet.  It's not really appetizing. \n\n3) General Sander's chicken platter - This was a relatively large dish for 25 dollars.  I think we got 6 pieces of dark meat chicken in total and an HK style egg waffle.  Let's start with the chicken.  The chicken was good.  Good crispy exterior albeit slightly dark in colour and perhaps slightly overdone.  Thankfully they give you dark meat otherwise I think it would be terribly dry.  Next, the dipping sauce.  One of them is a sichuan maple syrup.  It is absolutely atrocious.  It's not spicy...it's not sweet...it didn't enhance the flavour of the chicken.  The only word I could use to describe this is terribly unpalatable.  After dipping my first piece of chicken into it, I could not bear to touch it again...it was that awful.  Next are the HK style egg waffles which are actually a shade of dark brown.  They looked overdone.  But when you actually eat it, it's actually UNDERDONE inside! What?? How is that possible...it looks near burnt but inside is actually a thick underdone batter.  If anyone has ever had HK style waffles they're actually quite light and loose inside.  \n\nWe actually told the hostess or waitress about the underdone yet seemingly overdone waffles.  Her response was \"Ok.\"  Nothing was done to address it and we're not asking for a discount or a free meal or anything but we really just want them to be aware that this is not how HK style waffles are supposed to be. We're not even sure if the message got passed along to the kitchen.   \n\nWe also asked for sparking water which I'm fairly certain they keep on tap and make themselves.  For this water, we were charged 5 dollars.  Ok, I get it if you have to open up a bottle of San Pellegrino or Perrier or something but you didn't.  You just added carbon dioxide to your own tap water! Some restaurants give this for free (i.e. Pizzeria Libretto).  So why are you charging me 5 dollars for not even opening up a bottle of anything?  \n\nWhen this first restaurant opened, I wanted to like it.  I occasionally watched the first season of Masterchef Canada and watched Eric cook and to be honest, I was kind of rooting for him since not many Asians win and he also went to my alma mater. Not only that but when I was in Hong Kong earlier this year, I wanted to try Bo Innovation but couldn't because I couldn't eat a lot of the food they were serving as I was pregnant but had heard good things from family and friends who ate it.   Unfortunately this restaurant was not good and overpriced.  The one word I would use to describe the food is unpalatable.  I think that speaks volumes unfortunately.  We did see Eric come in during our meal and he was carrying a huge bag of rice and some other things.  Seems like he's putting a lot of hard work into the restaurant but as much as I would like to like it, objectively it just wasn't good.  So I really hope things change.", 1], ["I'm going to keep this brief because this place isn't worth too many words. \n\nDECOR: Gorgeous\n\nFOOD: Meh\n\nSERVICE: Snarky\n\nPRICE: Way overpriced for the food and the service but I guess they have to pay for all the fancy decor\n\nLOWEST POINT OF THE MEAL: On the menu, it says the Pork Baos were made every hour. The snarky server said that they only make it when there are enough customers. I guess a table of 7 does not constitute enough customers. We wanted to order the Chicken and Waffles. The snarky server said that the waffle maker was broken so they will just add extra chicken. We expressed our continued disappointment that again what we wanted wasn't available. Snarky server says \"WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ORDER IT!\". That sealed our impression of this place. \n\n\nOVERALL: Pass on this. This place is essentially lipstick on a pig.", 1], ["We came here for dinner, and food was mediocre. Majority of the dishes we ordered (grandpa's fun guo, tom yum salmon and their recommended fried rice) were okay, nothing special. However, staff was beyond friendly and made dinner that much more enjoyable.", 3], ["It's true, the pork buns are incredible.  We also had the lobster chow mein, little dragon buns, grandpas fun guo and bibimbap. \n\nWhen it comes to the food (especially the mains) there was no presentation, these dishes all were presented exactly as they would be in a regular dim sum restaurant.... and they came out just as fast, which means that with the food we ordered (above) we were all done in 30 minutes.  IF the flavour blew us away, then it would have been great, or IF we had no other chinese food in Toronto it would have been great and different--but it was no better than  a regular chinese restaurant (except for those pork buns, those were awesome) combine this with average service and R&D is an unfortunate disappointment.\n\nSo why two stars??  For the price we paid, we felt quickly churned out, nobody rushed us at all but it was like a \"okay we're done all of our food already....now what\".  Toronto already has great Chinese food at terrific prices.  R&D should have done more to differentiate their product in a city that already produces comparable food for the same or less.  I can get a bibimbap in Korea town for less than 1/2 what they are charging, the price would be palateable if the bibimbap was 2x as good at R&D but it just isnt....it was just a little different.\n\nThe table next to us ordered a few different items, yet we heard them joking about the cost as well.\n\nI do not suggest lowering prices.  Work on the menu and improve the customer experience along with it to validate the prices.

Alvin Leung, three Michelin-starred restaurant chef/owner of Bo Innovation in Hong Kong and London, meets Eric Chong, winner of the premier season of Master Chef Canada. \"We grew up in the same part of Toronto,\" says Leung, \"but at different times.\" It's a culinary marriage made in reality TV heaven, transformed into the reality of an exciting new Toronto restaurant called R&D.\n\nThe Rebel and The Demon threw everything into the pool and developed a menu that is liberated from any parameters. It is Chinese cooking that explores the global community of its neighbouring Kensington Market.\n\nStart with Duck Bak Kut Teh soup with a matzo ball. This is not my bubbie's matzo ball soup, but then again, she never knew about five-spice seasoning. Follow up with\n\nsome modern dim sum. Grandpa's Fun Guo steamed half moon dumplings filled with chicken and black truffle are a rarity on a Chinese menu, but a staple in the Chong family kitchen. An order of slim, delicate eggrolls, like fine rolled cigars, gives us a uniquely crisp texture and intensity of chicken and pesto.\n\nThe menu is so diverse but each dish is a winner of Master Chef quality. Ceviche of bay scallops, spot and tiger prawns pickled in Szechwan wine and soy sauce, and enrobed in\n\na jolo butter from Shanghai is a mellifluous medley of east and west and south that cannot be pegged as any one cuisine but reflect the finesse and range of imagination in this kitchen. Chargrilled octopus with choy sum chimichuri and eggplant is reminiscent of a wonderful fresh Latin American oceanside dish but with urban sophistication and flare. Roasted beets in a goat cheese vinaigrette bedazzled with crisp fried lotus root, candied walnuts and ginger bread shows off textures and colours with sweet and tart notes in a dish that knows no culinary borders.\n\nAfter tasting the ingredients of China town, Mixologist Robin James Wynne has redefined the Pina Colada by infusing chai, as well as toasted coconut shavings and tapioca pearls for a multi-textured beverage that delivers us to the tropics...of Asia.\n\nAdmiring the dramatic d\u00e9cor in what was once a Spadina Avenue factory, original floorboards (oh if they could speak), a refined wood ceiling, and a long bar and lounge invites us, but it's the dining room that has wow factor. Two murals convey the personalities of R&D: on the north wall, an interpretation of Eric, \"The Rebel\"; while the south wall belongs to \"The Demon Chef\", Alvin. Perfectly lit, not too bright, not too dim, and energetic music that is not thumping so loud we can't hear ourselves think. It's just very cool.\n\nGeneral Sanders Chicken catches my eye. Neither Tso nor the Colonel ever had it so good. Served on a wooden platter with a dusting of five spice and dips of kung pao and Sichuan maple sauce, we devour the generous portion of tender chicken and HK egg waffles. We love the dish that won Eric the Master Chef competition. His lobster chow\n\nmein of hand-made chitarra noodles and plenty of wok-fried lobster is clean and bursting with flavour.\n\nHoly duck! Chef Leung introduces us to the 76-hour Peking Duck. \"I want you to taste the meat, not just the skin, so we're doing it slightly different...but you would expect that from me anyway,\" he laughs. Served with steamed buns and three slaws of cucumber, scallion and hoisin; mango asian pear and plum; cabbage, carrot and ginger; we've never tasted duck so meaty and tender. We can only guess at the slow three-day cooking infusion that could elicit such flavour.\n\nThere is so much more we want to order from this smart menu. It's inventive, with influences and ingredients from across Asia and around the world that showcase the deftness and attitude of these two chefs. For dessert we indulge in smoked-milk fried crisp with malted milk ice cream and a lemon zest. There is a selection of Chinese teas from Pu-erh to the house-made Spadina Blend. We look over and see Eric in the kitchen beaming his signature smile. He is happy, and so are we.

Old rap music plays in the background as very perky and enthusiastic weight staff proudly summarize the menu. \n\nThe polarity in this restaurant's theme is also evident in the food. There were some good and not so good dishes.\n\nI started with 510 caesar which had an Asian twist including mushroom infused vodka and a nori garnish.  It was smallish in volume so it didn't last very long.  \n\nThe star was Eric's curry mainly because it was ingeniously different.  The sour and heat of the dish pushed the envelope as it would expect mosted dishes here to do.\n\nThe general sanders' chicken was also delicious. It was crispy outside and most in the middle.  The waffles were a nice touch but more a garnish than a key component of the dish.  \n\nThe tom yum dragon buns could be better described as soup dumplings. The thai flavours were smart.  \n\nThe beef tartare was an interesting twist on the traditional dish with the addition of the son in law egg.  \n\nThe octopus was good. In particular, the choy sum chimichurri was quite intelligent. \n\nI would expect nothing less than gimmickry for a place who's origin stems from a reality cooking show.  The CSB buns, which are as supposedly as  rare as a compliment from Alvin Leung himself, are made hourly and one can consider themselves lucky to score a pair.  The bread was amazing although the filling was a wee bit scarce.  \n\nOne of the most expensive dishes on the menu is the lobster chow mein ($25).  It had a decent portion of the crustacean but was otherwise unremarkable and almost boring.\n\nThe scallop dish was unbalanced regardless of whatever combination of the greens, hollandaise or chili sauce I used.  It was too bitter and the heat wasn't balanced with anything. The scallops were not overdone but were missing the good sear I was hoping for.  \n\nIn the end, it was a decent dining experience.  Prices were a little on the high side but to be expected given the celebrity status.  Eric may drop you a hello but like on the show, exhibits a methodical and stoic demeanor more indicative of an engineer than a flashy television chef.\n\nCall it a weak 4 for a strong 3 depending on how much Alvin Leung irritates you.", 3], ["Bland tasting, small portions and expensive.\n\nHad lunch with two other friends here. We ordered Shrimp Toast, Poutine and the Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs.\nThe server assured us that the plates would be more than enough for the three of us.\n\nThe Shrimp Toast was basically 3 small toasts with shrimp on top. \"13 dollars for 3 toasts\", we thought they would be substantial, but that was not the case. One bite each.\n\nThe main plate, Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs, were small but OK tasting. Nothing special.\nThe pineapple ginger slaw that goes with it didn't quite fit the plate and none of us took more than a bite of it.\n\nThe Poutine was also (surprise) small: it had a few pieces here and there of food in the bowl. And, also, tasted bland.\n\nThe three of us agreed that every single item that we ordered was too expensive for the value (be it taste or substance) it provided us.\n\nWe left the place hungry and ended up getting some food to complement our lunch in another restaurant down the street.", 1], ["The meal started with a hit, CSB (cha siu bao - bbq pork buns topped with a sweet and crunchy pineapple bun topping. They openly admit that it was inspired by Tim Ho Wan's bbq pork buns, and they do a pretty good dupe.

We were two of many people seated around the bar, but the service from our bartender cum server was always attentive and personal. From the hostess to the servers, I would give them no less than 10/10 for service.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the starters were 'meh'. The oysters reflect what are normally used in chinese cooking,  meaty but fishy.  The tom yum little dragon buns had a strange combination of tastes, and a hardened/dried dough at the top.\n\nMoving onto the entrees, the grilled salmon belly and beef brisket curry were an improvement, but both had very singular flavour profiles were lacking in presentation. The banana split dessert was a treat for my sweet tooth, and a generous portion. However, the coconut whipped cream and the strange ice cream flavours were a mish mash of discordant flavours, reminiscent of a kid dipping his finger in all the flavours in the candy shop.\n\nLuckily for R+D, they have quite the drink menu for those who are adventurous. If you're up for a drink or two, each has a slight asian twist while staying true to the original mix.\n\nAll in all, would I go back? Probably.\n\nThe General Sanders chicken and the duck duck bao seem enticing,  and the drinks and the service are enough to bring me back.

You gave us great recommendations, and you could tell that he spoke from his own experience in trying all of the food for himself!  He even got us a tableside visit from Masterchef Eric for the special occasion and he stayed for a quick chat and wished my mom a happy birthday, which was really sweet.\n\nAs for the food, we were also super happy with what we got.  We tried the char siu bao and curry bao to start.  Both were really delicious, light with nice subtle flavours.  We also went all out and ordered the Peking duck which is really a phenomenal dish.  They brought the duck to the table for us to see before they carved it up.  The meat was moist and tender, and the skin was perfectly crisp.  I have probably eaten over 100 Peking ducks, and this was one of the best ducks I have ever eaten.  My only wish was that they would also serve the regular steamed wrappers and the pan-fried wrappers.  But still no complaints, that duck was an A+++.  We also got the Laksa chow mein (spicy with great seafood flavours; a definite yes!), the cauliflower curry (I could have drank that sauce on its own... yum) and the Kalbi short ribs.  The short ribs were alright, but a touch salty and tricky to eat.\n\nCocktails from the $7 cocktail menu were also really tasty (the Oolong G&T and the Melancholy).\n\nOverall, a totally wonderful birthday dinner for the family.  Would love to go again!", 5], ["I have heard such great things about this restaurant and finally got to try. \n\nWe were warmly greeted at the door with big smiles. Since it was our first time eating Tibetan, I had some questions regarding vegan options. It turned out all but two of their veggie momos are vegan. I also asked if their golden tea could be made vegan and the owner said coconut milk option was coming soon. \n\nWe ordered chili chicken with ting mo (steamed buns recommended by owner) for Mr Leny and half plates of beet and portobello mushroom momos for myself. \n\nMr Leny chose spicy for his chili chicken and said there was a definite kick. He enjoyed it immensely and said the ting mo were perfect for sopping up all the sauce. \n\nThe veggie momos were both delicious. I would definitely order again. There were four sauces on every table:  tomato, soy, smoked chili and hot chili which was very spicy. My favourite was the tomato which was slight sweet and mild but quite flavourful. The owner suggested mixing the chili sauces with the tomato to bring down the heat. \n\nIt was a wonderful meal with prompt and friendly cheerful service.

Came for a late lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant itself is really cute, with some Tibetan chants playing softly.\n\nOrdered beef and lamb momos, and chili chicken. The momos come with a soup, so we got one beef, one vegetable. Also ordered a bhod cha (butter tea).\n\nThe tea came out first and this was my first time trying butter tea. Even though I knew it was butter, I still found it surprisingly salty and creamy. Might not be for everyone, but I did find it quite appetizing.\n\nI liked to use a combination of the 3 sauces for the momos which gives it an extra garlicy, smokey (from the roasted chillies) flavour. The momos themselves are seasoned nicely and wrapped in a nice chewy wrapper.\n\nThe service is amazing. We just wanted to know more about how the sweet tea would taste, and the waitress came out with a half-cup sized sample. Very friendly. Would definitely come back.", 4], ["Loved the momos and hospitality here! This rustic, homely place was almost empty when we walked in on a weekend for a late lunch and the owner cheerfully gestured for us to take a seat anywhere. The interior was simple but comfortable and spacious, perfect for spending a lazy afternoon.\n\nThe menu was short and straightforward, but of course the restaurant is most famous for their momos, some of which had quite unique ingredients which I've never seen before at other Tibetan places. We picked two types of meat momos and two types of veggie momos, and everything was delicious! I was particularly impressed with the latter - who could've know that butternut squash, broccoli, and non-dairy cheese could make such a delightful filling? The food tasted very healthy and looked charming too, these delicate and colourful parcels arranged in a bamboo steamer. On the other hand, I did find the portions to be a bit small given the price - $6-7 for 5 momos is on the expensive side.\n\nThe experience we had here is also worth mentioning - the owner (and his wife) were so welcoming and genial! From introducing the items on the menu, to answering our questions about the sauces (there was a wonderfully spicy one, may I add), to just chatting with us as we paid the bill, we were made to feel right at home.

Our dishes came with a choice of soup and we chose bone broth which a bowl full of comfort food! They also provided some sauces to eat with the momos which were very interesting and flavourful.

The restaurant is family-run, and just watching the staff interact with each other is a pleasure onto itself. The ambience is very relaxed. The white painted exposed brick walls and solitary column near the front give a very cool, safe retreat from the heat of summer.\n\nOn to the food. Once in a while, you come across a dish that you know was made with love - and not in an abstract way. You know food was made with love because you can see and taste the difference. I had three half plates of momos: the shrimp, mushroom, and beet. The first thing that strikes you is the quality of the ingredients, which you can immediately appreciate because there's room to let them shine. These aren't packed with salt and fat. They actually all taste quite healthy, which is a nice addition to their also tasting phenomenal. The shrimp is densely packed and meaty, the beet was bright tasting, and the mushroom had an earthy flavour that was perfectly matched with the paneer. \n\nJust as a last note - the hot pepper condiment is an absolutely unique experience. It almost has a tobacco, smoky essence that is worth just trying on its own. It is spicy though, so watch out. \n\nWill definitely be back with family and friends!", 5], ["A good experience. The most impressive features were the warm service and beautifully decorated and relaxing ambience. You can tell the owners put in real effort to create a welcoming environment. \n\nChecked this place out with a friend because we really wanted momos without traveling to Parkdale. \nIt happened to be \"Momo mania\" (mon and tues) which means the menu is different and focuses only on momos. The regular menu is available but only on a limited request. \n\nThe Food:\n- the food (especially kale salad and soup) tasted very fresh. We tried quite a number of items on the list and what stood out the most was probably the cabbage momos (3/5).\n- overall, The momos simply did not have the pop of flavour that I was used to from my numerous haunts through the Tibetan restaurants in Parkdale. This is despite lathering on the sauces and tasted somewhat under-seasoned. They also seemed slightly on the small side. \n\nOverall, although I wasn't blown away by the dishes we tried, I'm happy Tibetan food is now an available option on the danforth.", 3], ["Located on the Danforth and easily accessible by TTC (only a few minutes walk from Chester subway station), Momo Hut & Gardens is one of the best Tibetan restaurants in the city. It offers a wide variety of uniquely creative vegan and vegetarian dumplings, with filings such as potatoes, kale & curry, paneer, spinach & vermicelli noodles, beets & avocado, mushrooms, cabbage, and non-dairy cheese. Most momo & dumpling restaurants only serve 1-2 kinds of vegetarian dumplings, but Momo Hut & Gardens' impressive selection makes it a gem for plant-based momos / dumplings.\n\nNot only do the momos look pretty and nicely presented, they also taste very delicious. The momos seem to be crafted by hand, each one with intricate design and arranged nicely in the bamboo basket steamers. Each of the vegetarian momos tastes unique - our favourites were the mushrooms and beets dumplings.\n\nYou can order the dumplings in half-order (5 pieces) or full-order (10 pieces). Each dumpling is perfectly sized (not too big and not too small), so you can order a variety to try.\n\nEvery table comes with 3 different sauces / garnishes for the dumplings: spicy chili, soy sauce, and tomato & garlic (really good to go with the mushroom dumplings). The dumplings come with a small salad (sometimes cucumber slices, sometimes pickled daikon... depending on the day) and soup (you can choose between meat or veggie broth... I chose the veggie broth, and it came with a few slices of mushrooms).\n\nThe Crispy Cauliflower appetizer is another favourite dish at Momo Hut - it's not breaded and fried (so it's healthier), and the garlic sauce tastes so good.\n\nFor dessert, there are Fried Bananas and Sweet Lhasa (fried momos filled with apple, barley, and cinnamon, served with 2 big scoops of vanilla ice cream, strawberry slices, sliced almonds, and strawberry sauce).\n\nThe ambiance is casual, and the background music and interior decorations (Tibetan flags adorning the ceilings, Tibetan scenic paintings on the walls) add to the authentic feel of the restaurant.

We ordered the beef and chicken momos, the chili fries (similar to Lisa Marie's pad thai fries but less spicy), and the chili chicken + rice.

Who doesn't like dumplings?", 5], ["Momo Hut is a great spot on the Danforth to some delicious Tibetan food outside of Parkdale. I went to Momo Hut & Gardens with a group of about six people and we got to try a lot of the different momos here. If you have never had momos before, they are Tibetan style dumplings. The wrapper is a bit thicker and chewier than Chinese style dumplings and the dumplings themselves are bigger as well. One thing I loved about the ones at Momo Hut were how each type were either wrapped in different shapes or had a different (naturally) coloured wrapper.\nAll the momos came out steaming hot in bamboo baskets and they were perfect for sharing. \n\nMy favourite momos were surprisingly the non-traditional Beet Momos which also had cauliflower and avocado. The filling was really creamy and it has a slight earthiness from the beets but not too much. I also really liked the Beef Momos which were very beefy and quite juicy. On every table at Momo Hut there were little dishes of their house made hot sauce and their garlic tomato sauce to accompany the momos. I highly recommend trying both since it really enhanced the flavour of their dishes. \n\nI didn't particularly like the mushroom momos because the taste was very strong and the mushrooms were not as tender as I had hoped. However many of my friends still enjoyed the mushroom momos so it could be a matter of personal taste. We also order a dish of chili chicken which was flavourful and definitely a crowd pleaser.\n\nFor drinks, I tried their Sol-Ja Ngarmo, a hot Tibetan sweet tea. The tea reminded me a bit of English black tea with milk and sugar but lightly spiced with cardamom. I much preferred this over their Bhod Cha which was a salted butter tea that was milky and just slightly salted. Regular soft drinks are available too but it was fun to try some traditional Tibetan beverages.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance was fairly simple with white walls, wooden tables and a few Tibetan decorations on the walls. The service was incredibly hospitable and welcoming and it felt like I was eating food made with love. The prices were also very affordable with their momos all under $10.

However, I'm confused as to why this restaurants have so many positive reviews.\n\nWe ordered the pork momo and the mushroom momo. I ordered pork momo because pork is usually the most flavourful protein to have in a dumpling. I'm also the first one to complain when a dish is overly salty. However, I feel like they didn't add any salt to the pork at all! Salt would've brought out the flavour of the pork. I really did not enjoy the mushroom momo but I think it's because of the soy bean. Since this is due to a personal preference, I can't really comment further on the mushroom momo.\n\nThe food isn't cheap either. It's $10.49 for 10 pieces of pork momos and $11.99 for 10 pieces of mushroom momos. You can't really argue that it's handmade so it justifies the price. There are handmade dumplings in Scarborough for $8 max and you can get 12-15 pieces of dumplings (New Northern Dumplings). The rent is probably more expensive on the Danforth than Scarborough but for the price of dumplings, this is definitely on the high end.\n\nThe service was also lacking. They didn't give us the menu so we had to go up and get it from the cashier. After we ordered, they forgot to bring us the soup so I had to ask for that as well. By the end of the meal, I decided to just go up and pay because it took forever to get their attention for the bill.\n\nI feel like people are giving this restaurant five stars because we don't have many Himalayan/Nepalese restaurants in the city and also because this restaurant is family run (of course we want to support small businesses).

The nice thing is that if you order a half portion (5 in a half, 10 in a full order) you can easily try 4 or 5 different types. We tried the lamb, chicken, spinach & feta, and shrimp. All delicious, honestly I couldn't choose a favourite. The momos also come with a clear broth and a salad which consists of tomatoes and cucumbers. \n\nWe also ordered a few apps, the crispy cauliflower and crispy deep fried pork. The cauliflower was not really crispy but the sauce it was drenched in was so flavourful. We actually ended up dipping the momos and crispy pork in it!  The crispy pork was a little too crispy.

Tibetan momos are made in house & comes in steamer baskets with soya, chili & chutney dipping sauces on the side. There are both meat filled and vegetarian momos to choose. I ordered 10 beef momos ($16) which includes a salad and soup of the day. The momos were juicy and tasty on its own but the momo chutney dip & chili (very spicy) made them even better. It was a very filling and satisfying meal and the owner was very gracious.", 4], ["We tried this spot during the ritual $1 meal deal and were blown away.  The attention to detail, service and quality of food were all amazing.  Nepalese food is not the first thing you think of when you think of the Danforth, but this place didn't fail to impress.  The momos were tasty and fresh, and the side of edamame was huge and tasty.", 5], ["Good spot for U of T students or others in downtown! I ordered the pork original with thin noodles and garlic oil. The broth was good, and I definitely recommend adding garlic oil if you love garlic like I do! I also got the house lemonade; very refreshing and not overly sweet.

Finally I got kind of pushy and went to the back where they were putting together the orders and they finally found her ticket (was it lost in the mix?). They weren't rude about it they just didn't really care or own up to it. \n\nThe ramen itself was pretty good tasting but they don't come with many toppings so you end up spending an extra 5-6$ for basic toppings like bean sprouts, egg, and nori .", 2], ["Amazed with the taste of the soup and the egg.

The rich black sesame broth is absolutely amazing, so good that I wish they have it as a regular broth.

We got to try all 3 of hair special desserts, and we LOVED the black sesame soy milk pudding! The soft and smooth texture melts in your mouth with the a fine punch of the amazing black sesame! Their roasted green tea pudding is not super sweet, but balanced the tea flavour really well! As well, the matcha cheese cake is really dense with strong cheesy flavour.

Literally, the bowls seem to be getting smaller and same with the ingredients in the dish. For example, the Miso comes with corn and lately its been more and more difficult to spot the corn in the broth.  The only thing that is getting bigger is the price. Once listed at $10.99, a bowl will now set you back $12.99.\n\nThis place was my 'go to spot for Ramen but has now slipped into second place. I hope they can regain the number one spot again!\n\nCheers.", 3], ["Kinton used to be my go to for ramen, but with so many other ramen places in Toronto, this one just doesn't stand up. \n\nI do enjoy how they cook their noodles, and the service was and is always great.", 3], ["There are little things more satisfying on a cold, wet evening than a big bowl of tonkotsu ramen.

Pro tip: order extra pork and add an egg. \n\nHad to dip into a friend's order and try her original chicken ramen. Imagine home made chicken noodle soup taken to the next level with a deep, intense and complex broth - almost the most chickeny thing I've ever tasted.

However, I wouldn't recommend it as a place for catching up as the service is pretty fast and the restaurant has a pretty high turnover, making it difficult for you to stay for long.\n\nI enjoyed the Spicy Garlic Ramen I ordered. I normally don't find Japanese spicy ramen soup spicy, but I could actually taste the spiciness! I ordered the thick noodles and fully enjoyed the texture of the noodles. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time at Kinton Ramen. However I still can't decide whether it's better than my favorite ramen place in Toronto- Ramen Isshin.", 4], ["This Kinton is really busy around lunch! There's always a line and the turn over for each table is about an hour! You have to ask for water multiple times when they're busy. \n\nTheir flavours are always consistent.

It comes with 4 pieces. Not sure if it's dependent on the size of the piece, or what. \n\n\nThere's a lot of street parking around, but it can be tough to find a spot.

The seasoned egg was not fully cooked, which is my favourite for hard boiled eggs. The takoyaki, however, was soggy (makes sense since it was in the broth) but it contained a few diced octopus pieces. The meal was almost good but the size was small and I would have preferred if the broth was richer. I've had Kinton's other ramen bowls and they are small too so it was no surprise. I think Kinton strives for quality more than quantity but it's important in case you want something to fill you up, not just a nice photo (I'm guilty!).", 3], ["Pretty decent but I don't think I'd come back.

I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions\n\nLook, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed \"fine dining\" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  \n\nFor starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the \"octopus\" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant pur\u00e9e.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  \n\nOn to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  \n\nThe ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  \n\nOverall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver", 3], ["I love this venue so much. We rented out the entire place for a VIP dinner after a conference, and they made our group feel like royalty. I wasn't the main coordinator of this event but ended up playing a part in the execution. Every staff member from the bouncer to the bartender was helpful... our guests commented on that, too!\n\nThroughout the evening, the Blu staff proactively looked for guests that needed coat check and showed them the way. We didn't even ask them to do that. Nothing was \"below them\" in terms of customer service. My colleagues and I sat at the bar for dinner because we were tired from event production. We were well taken care of in terms of food and drink.\n\nI had the beet risotto for dinner and tiramisu for dessert. I can't remember my appetizer, but it was similarly amazing. Such flavor and texture. I was floored. Love the prix fixe menu with a few options per course. Not sure if we branded them or they did, but it elevated the experience, and everyone enjoyed their time here. \n\nWe had a projector for some announcements but didn't use it because  conversations were too loud. Good problem to have at a private networking dinner! I can't think of a single thing I would have changed. The restaurant got crowded, but that's probably because we invited too many people. On Blu's side, it was perfect.", 5], ["Fantastic service and wonderful dishes. We arrived on a Sunday night at 6pm and shared the entire restaurant with two other tables.

Honestly I don't know why I didn't know about this place until recently! Will definitely refer people to this place.", 5], ["We had the Prix Fixe menu and the Lamb was sooo good. I also enjoyed the carpaccio which was a step out of my comfort zone. The Rabbit Terrine was not that good and we had a bit of the seafood linguine which had nice seafood (the shrimp was so good) but the pasta seemed like you can make it at home with $1 box of pasta. The dessert we had was the Zeppole, Coconut & Lime Cannoli, and the Basil Lime Panna Cotta, I pretty much disliked all of them (still ate it anyways though). Would come again for the Lamb! I usually don't like lamb but this was so good and juicy. I also tried some of the steak which was tougher and a bit burned.", 4], ["Excellent food, exceptional service, great cocktails and wine.

Very appropriate for a business dinner, such as the one I attended.  I can see it being a great date night spot, as well.  The lighting is low, the color palette rich and luxurious, with a little urban vibe throw in for good measure.  Not too quite, not too loud.  The worst part about Blu is not being able to decide what to order.\n\nThe table started with a carchuterie plate, which went around pretty quickly but was right-sized for the table of 8.  Lots of bread and butter was consumed.  I wanna say the butter had some kind of unique flavor.  I would have preferred regular, good old fashioned butter but this is just a minor detail!  Lots of cocktails and wine were consumed before our plates came out.\n\nMost people ordered something different.  I don't exactly recall (after a few drinks) what I ordered but I remember it being delicious!  Everyone was very happy with their selections.

Now, granted, I did go during Winterlicious, so food/service is bound to be less than perfect, but it just felt very rushed.  The servers were fine really.

We asked our waiter for the bill, instead of bringing our bill right away, he went around cleaning tables, coffee makers, chatting with other waiters, pretty much anything BUT bringing our bill.

Very different but good and although the octopus tentacle was pretty thick it was amazingly tender, could cut with a fork. Server told me it was vacuum sealed, placed in waterproof bag and then placed in a machine. Never heard of this but as someone who likes to cook would love to find out more. For the main course had a ravioli stuffed with salmon and a mild cheese (not sure which kind) in a lemon beurre sauce. I was a little disappointed with this dish as it was hard to taste the salmon and overall the dish to me was bland. I think had the salmon been more prominent the dish would have been better.

It wasn't as good as the Shameful Tiki Room, but it offered the basics that Shameful nails in spades: bamboo-laden walls and furnishings, dark corners to zombify happily, a teensy corner where bands can overwhelm the otherwise mellow vibe, and the occasional Volcano bowl gong-and-mist celebration, an all around fun time. All of this cleverly hidden, Toronto style, just inside a banal street side front door that I didn't hardly notice, walking by.\n\nLike I said, we had one of these hideouts in my city, and after college I never stopped in, I just took it for granted.

Plants brush my cheek, a rumble from a distance volcano, music old and familiar can be heard. My eyes adjust, and I am greeted by a girl with a big smile, wearing a happy Hawaiian shirt. \n\n    I ask to sit at the bar, I have been transported back to a Polynesian paradise.

Yes the menu! Here every concoction from a Chi Chi to The Zombie, each drink as delicious as it is lethal. I order, \"A Jet Pilot.\" It was perfect.

The guacamole and chips were delicious though I must say.

I'd say it's appropriate for a date! \n\nTo start off, we ordered the 'Mystery Bowl' which consisted of a mixture of \"juices, rum, and secret spices\" as put on their menu served in a fancy frog bowl with very longgggg straws. The drink was quite fruity; a lot like fruit punch. The bowl may make this drink look plentiful but, half of the bowl was filled with ice. Upon it being served, you'd hear a loud rumble and the entire staff chant \"MYSTERY BOWLLL!\". It definitely lightens up the atmosphere and gets you amped up for trying this drink. It's perfect for 2 but, doable for 3!\n\nAs for food, we ordered the 'full' Shameful Tiki Platter instead of the 'small'. Six items for the full platter and three for the small. Here are the 6 items and my two cents:\n\n1) Tiki Corn: basically popcorn drizzled with what I thought to be butter but, it was really coconut oil. (No wonder I tasted a hint of sweetness in them!)\n\n2) Teriyaki Fried Broccoli: pretty much your broccoli tempura served at a Japanese restaurant served with a sweet sauce. \n\n3) Crab Rangoo: deep fried wonton stuffed with cream cheese and crab served with a mustard sauce. Tasted the cream cheese in one bite however, not so much for the crab.\n\n4) Volcano Wings: it 'looks' very yummy however, I've been deceived. Wings were very tiny and lacks flavour. You'd get most of the flavour from eating the skin. As for the meat, it's kind of dry and quite bland. (These wings will definitely come to life if they were submerged in the marinate for a longer period of time!)\n\n5) Loko-Moko Ball: out of all the items, this is my fav. Love the texture and spices in this thing. A ball of sticky rice with a ground beef core and topped with mushroom gravy. YUM!!! \n\n6) Cocoughnuts: don't be fooled by its appearance. This stuff feels rock hard on the outside as it took some effort for us to pierce through them with our forks. They're pretty much timbits but on the drier side.. Not much of a satisfying dessert for us.. ):\n\nOverall, food and drink was mediocre. I'd say this is definitely a novelty-kind-of restaurant. Service however, was superb. Servers were very knowledgeable about the items on the menu with a very approachable and conversational attitude.", 3], ["Definitely one of my most favourite bars in Toronto. I'm so obsessed. I first came here in late December. I love the kitschy & authentic vibe in here. It's the best little city escape because no matter what time it is or what type of weather, the front is completely blacked out, so you're able to truly escape. I also LOVE the theatrical aspects from the delivery of their specialty bowl beverages(for sharing or ambitious folks). The food is all pretty good as well. \n\nI would recommend making a reservation for a larger party to avoid disappointment as this place fills up quickly, especially on a prime night.

My husband ate a chili in the sauce and regretted it, but still thoroughly enjoyed them. The whole branzino was perfectly cooked and seasoned. And of course the pork side ribs to finish - we order them every time and this time they were the largest I can recall.\n\nService was great and enjoyed our cocktails.

I don't know about other people but I don't have an issue with servers stopping me from ordering more because I feel like the establishment isn't out to get my money and just wants me to have a good dinner and not waste food.  Thanks, appreciate it. \n\nMy friend chose this restaurant because it was recommended to him. The menu wasn't available online so he wasn't able to check out the food. When we got there, we noticed quite a few of the dishes were spicy and I cannot eat spicy at all. I'm weak! When we got our food, dishes that we didn't expect to be spicy were spicy. This was surprising to us because we purposely went through the menu ordering dishes that we didn't think would be spicy. I didn't end up eating very much that night and ordered more oysters which were pretty good. I had a bit of everything we did order though and the food was cooked fine.\n\nSo clearly this isn't a restaurant for people like me which is fine. Not going to complain about that because that's just a preference and not really an issue BUT FYI FOR ALL YOU OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME.

We're pretty far from this place so when we got there on Sunday and found it was closed on Sundays, that was extremely frustrating. Let me just add that we were freezing and starving. Sure, we didn't check to see if it was opened on Sunday but at the same time, if we're speaking to a worker there, I would think they should know the hours?! Not cool.", 3], ["I originally planned to eat somewhere else in the area but the original restaurant I wanted to dine at had a long wait for a table. I walked around and passed by Foxley and decided to give it a try. \n\nThe restaurant was surpassingly quite empty for an evening on a Saturday. My group was seated immediately. \n\nService:\nThe service could have been better if the staff was more attentive. \n\nFood:\nThe food was alright and the portions were really small. There wasn't a single dish that impressed me. The hanger steak came out to be dry. \n\nGiven their prices, I rather visit other restaurants for Asian fusion tapas.", 2], ["Vietnamese fusion?  I wasn't so sure about that since I'm Vietnamese and fusion restaurants rarely live up to the hype.  Foxley is basically a small bar turned restaurant with a hip vibe.  The tables are small, so not good for groups.\n\nThe blue crab avocado dish had all the right flavours and textures. \n It was fresh yet had all the exotic Vietnamese flavours (including fish sauce).  This is something you must order if you come here.  The rest of the dishes were great too, but that was the highlight.  Coming in for an early dinner, there was no wait, but as we sat there chatting, I could feel a bit of pressure to leave.  There was just under ten people waiting in line and so all were eager to have our table cleared.", 5], ["A charming and underrated spot in the middle of Ossington. Our visit was off to a sour start when one of the female servers gave us attitude about standing in the way of the entrance while waiting for our table. Nonetheless after killing time at another nearby bar, our table was ready and we were promptly seated.\nOur server was wonderful at explaining in great detail each unique dish- we went with his recommendation and ordered the tuna ceviche (I could not stop embarrassingly licking the plate). Other items we ordered were the frog legs, sea bream ceviche, lamb and duck proscuitto dumplings, chicken wings, pork belly, beef short ribs, hanger steak and the sauteed asian greens. All dishes arrived in really awkward intervals. Some mains were served first, some appetizer orders had to be gently reminded and our forgotten sauteed greens arrived 20 minutes after we finished our meal. It appeared they were pumping out the dishes as they were made, but it made the dining experience annoyingly tantalizing. Next time I would pass on the dumplings (not worth writing home about as you can only taste the flavour of lamb), the hanger steak was dry and tough, the frog legs were quite soggy (while the sauce was amazing), and the sauteed asian greens (baby bok choy with bland sauce)- other mentioned items were delicious and I would recommend them. Service was great, drinks were constantly refilled and empty dishes were swiftly taken away. \nDrink list was just alright, we ordered a red for the table and a few drafts of Estrella beer. Wish they had some better drink options but our dinner was pretty solid.", 4], ["We went on Friday after 6pm and we were the first customer for this restaurant.  There have only few tables and find the space is very tight.  I personally don't like going dining where I feel like I am pack like sardines.   \n\nI find the food nothing special or I would say wow.   I try the avocado and crab salad which one of the reviewer said it was good.  I just find I can make it at home.  Cut the avocado in half and open a can of crab meat with some dressing and voila.  I bet it taste much better than the one I had.    I did like the kale salad with cheese.   I think the cheese make the highlight of the kale which was worth ordering.    Beef ribs was ok.  I think they could have marinade the ribs longer to let the flavour develop more.   I think it was like three slice of ribs in total which I find the price was over rated.  I could have gone to Korean restaurant and order a whole plate for same price.\n\nI have two servers and they both looked very gloomy.   One of them taking our order and when I  asked him a question he was looking somewhere else.  It was a bit odd because they were no new customers.  Didn't find staff friendly or attentive during our dinner service.  \n\nPrice is over price.  Would I bring someone or recommend this place?  No.  There are lots of good restaurants along the Ossington areas that serve better food.", 1], ["Really good food and really good service.  Tried 7 dishes ranging from crab and avocado to all types of ribs and fried chicken and still having a hard time deciding which was my favorite!\nI like the concept of not having a standard wine list but there's room for better wine choices.  \n\nHad a second visit here and it was great again! Can't say if the wine list was improved but definitely our choice was better suited to their food offering.  Keep on hitting it out of the park guys!", 4], ["A cute, relaxed spot for fantastic food. The kale salad converted my kale-hating friend, and the hanger steak with chimichurri was like being punched in the face with flavour, but in a good way. The pork short ribs melted right off the bone with the fainted brush of a fork, and the sauce was rich and sweet without being cloying. I'll definitely be adding this to my list of favourite local restaurants!", 5], ["Had dinner here Saturday night with my boyfriend. We had several plates and had some cocktails followed by wine.

I love sitting at the bar because water service is frequently on point, you can observe the on goings of the open kitchen (if there is one), watch the bartenders in action and converse with the servers. Also, I love to sit right beside my company. \n\nProtip: bar seats are great if you're on a date, an accidental thigh bump or intentional arm graze helps heat up the evening. \n\nWhat we ate: \n\n- Lamb and duck prosciutto gyozas (4/5) - Boiled then pan fried Asian style dumplings. The lamb has delightfully gamey and the soup inside the dumplings had a sweet tone. Minor bump in rating because two of our dumplings had punctured skins.\n\n- Salmon tataki with avocado salad (5/5) - A special for the night; my saliva glands are raging as I'm recalling the tastes in this dish. Thick slices of salmon with perfectly seared edges and a raw middle served on a bed of arugula salad mixed in wasabi mayo dressing. I'm underselling this dish, there was a gingery kicker in the salad dressing and all I remember was the party happening in my mouth. Order this if you see it on the special's menu.  \n\n- Grilled hanger steak with chimichurri (4/5) - Solid piece of meat. Chimichurri was a nice topping to the meat. Tender cut of steak, however a few slices required a few too many chews.\n\n- Grilled pike mackerel (5/5) - We love mackerel, this was grilled and seasoned simply. Our server helped us debone the spine before diving in. It was light and flaky. \n\n- Ginger molasses pork side ribs (5/5)- There were so many great choices on the menu we couldn't decide and asked our server to pick a meat dish for us. This was our \"surprise\" dish from the kitchen. Sweet, gingery molasses smeared on fall off the bone pork side ribs. It was the perfect sweet and savory way to end our meal. These bad boys aren't on the menu, so put in a friendly request! \n\nOur server Yvan (not pounced Y-van or E-van, but Yvan like Ivan with a French flair), was absolutely fantastic. He helped us decide what to order, provided killer recommendations and surprised us with special dishes when our taste buds were indecisive. We ended the night off with trading a list of our favourite eateries. Can't wait to try these next. \n\nEat here!\n\nSummary:\nFood (4.5/5) - See ratings above. \n\nService (10/10) - knowledgeable, friendly, entertaining and warm servers - restaurants should follow the hospitality of the servers here at Foxley.\n\nAtmosphere (10/10) - Hip interior design with an exposed brick accent wall. Lots of tables for two, great for a date spot.  Groups of 2+ are possible, could be a slight wait for groups larger than 4.  \n\nOh did I say...Eat here!", 5], ["I've been to this restaurant several times over the years. It has always been a staple in my choice of restaurants in the downtown core. The food is reliable, creative, fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is casual and I think it's quite reasonable. The chef has opened a number of restaurants in the downtown area over the years. I've been a fan of all of them.", 5], ["Upon entering this restaurant, I thought \"Wow, what a charming little place\"! It was warm and inviting; our group of 8 happily found ourselves in a comfortable little nook by the bar.\n\nThe food menu was fairly lengthy and was hard to read. For someone who typically loves perusing the menu for what to eat, I was frustrated to look at the crowded one-page list they'd compiled. I wanted to have a mix of cold and hot tapas so went ahead and ordered a veritable selection of items, including some \"specials\" off-menu.\n\nAfter tasting from a total of 15 dishes, all I can say is... everything tastes like yuzu. Don't get me wrong, the first few bites were AMAZING because I love anything with a citrus profile... but after a few dishes, it just got downright boring! Arctic char ceviche was served with an apple slaw and yuzu vinaigrette... Grilled quail was over a mango salad and yuzu vinaigrette... Salmon tataki ... served over greens and yuzu vinaigrette. I actually got so sick of that same flavour that I stopped eating before I was full. This is not to say that the food was bad, by any means, but I don't believe their menu is well-rounded and the preparation does not do the ingredients much justice.\n\nAnother disappointing factor was the abysmal service we received. The waiter (tall, blonde) did a decent job at taking our food order but there were a few rounds of drinks that took more than 20 minutes to arrive at our table after the order was placed. My friend ordered a glass of rose that had over-oxidized (I tasted it to verify) so she politely asked the waiter if she can have another glass and he rudely told her that \"she needs to cleanse her palette\". I understand that everyone has a different opinion on how wine should taste, but I would think that since we were a large group ordering more than $450 of food/beverages, he would at least entertain the idea of catering to her request a TINY bit. After 2.5 hours since our first food order, he nonchalantly brings out a plate of ribs which we were all confused to see. We looked around to ask one another who had ordered it and he mentioned that it was originally placed during the first round of our order. We ended up packing it up to take home, but I thought it was a really unprofessional way to respond to the situation on his part.\n\nThe food was OK, but will not be coming back due to bad service.", 3], ["Followed a recommendation from friends of mine to check out this little spot. I was dining solo and it really was the perfect place to do so. Foxleys is very easy to miss as the lettering is fairly small and being a bistro it's pretty tiny in size as well. Street parking only. I had to do four loops around the block on a Thursday night around 8 and was able to parallel across the street. The entrance way was a tad confusing. You couldn't see in through the front door and when you did open the door up, you had to guess which way to turn. I ventured to the left and was enclosed in this black curtain. At first I thought maybe they were closed because I couldn't understand why a place would have guests walk into an enclosed curtain. I literally felt like I was in a shower or behind a stage and just didn't know where to turn to break free or break in. I kind of poked my finger around and found an opening, thank goodness. For the claustrophobic out there, you would not have been happy with the situation. Immediately after finding my way, I saw a sign that said, 'Please wait to be seated.' A gentleman immediately noticed me and I asked if it was okay to sit at the bar, at which point he said of course and I took a seat. There were about two other two tops seated and one other person at the bar when I arrived. The interior is beautiful, but very small. Exactly what I would have pictured from the description my friends gave me being a bistro with tapas. I was given a wine list which was extensive for bottle purposes but I was wildly underwhelmed with the selection they offered by the glass. Only four reds to choose from, none of which really tickled my fancy. That was a little disappointing to start off the night. If you are dining with friends however, enormous selection. I went with a glass of Sangiovese, too fruit forward and acidic for my palate, my own fault though because that's exactly what a Sangiovese should be. It was $13 for a glass. I was eager to check out the menu, as the place was described as, \"Asian Fusion.\" Was it? I didn't really think so. \n\nThe gentleman assisting me was the same who greeted me at the door. He was very friendly and thoroughly described all of the specials to me in detail. There was another man who didn't utter a word to me the entire time I was there. I don't know if he was the manager or another bartender but I was alone, in a chatty mood and it wasn't being reciprocated, oh well. I took a look at the menu and it was too much to handle. It was a giant list of \"tapas\" but no organization, no classifications, no grouping, just one giant list. It was overwhelming. I wish it had been separated into you know, 'salads' 'ceviche' 'meat' something like that. I was all over the place. They had tapas for 9 bucks and some for 22 so I was curious about the different sizes. The bartender told me that most people go with 2 or 3 tapas. I inquired about the seaweed salad and the bartender told me that the kale one was better. Awesome. I love a good recommendation. I got the kale salad and it was ready within 5 minutes. It was BIG. I was shocked at the size of it, biggest small plate I had ever seen. It was a mountain of shredded kale topped with a hearty amount of pecorino romano cheese in a lemon dressing. It was also topped with some fried onions. The salad was TO DIE FOR. Seriously unbelievable combination of flavors, filled me up too, I just wanted more and more and more. It was served with chopsticks, which may have amused others if they happened to catch a glimpse of me mid bite. The bartender tried to push the ceviche on me in a completely polite way. He said that's what they were known for but I wasn't feeling that adventurous. Again, I didn't know where to go next, chicken? short ribs? pork? skate? veggie dish? There were so many options, which sounds great, but needed a little organization. Menus need to be visually stimulating to guests I think and this wasn't. I kept looking at the guy sitting at the bar next to me to see what he was ordering because he looked pretty content. Turns out he had chosen the pork side ribs with a caramel shallot glaze. I'll have what he's having. The pork took a long time and then some to come out. There were so few people in the place I was surprised it was taking so long for one dish. Finally they came out and they looked unbelievably delicious. Turns out, they weren't great. There were SO many bones and hard pieces at one point I actually swallowed one and was praying someone knew the heimlich for when it caught in my esophagus. Thankfully with the super attentive bartender who was on his water refilling game, there was enough fluid for it to go down. The sauce was great but there was WAY too much of it, couldn't catch the real flavor of the pork. There was probably only an ounce and a half of actual meat I was able to eat. Most of it was incredibly fatty. \n\nOverall experience was good enough. Restroom not handicap accessible, located in the basement.", 3], ["Following the recommendations on Yelp, we decided to take a gander at Foxley.

I almost didn't even want to eat my next meal because I felt nothing could top this. \n\nFoxley serves up some great sharing plates, which is my favourite way to eat a meal. Who doesn't love to eat a bit of everything and share it with some great company? \n\nWe had the Wahoo Ceviche with a spicy mango salad, Inari with shitaki mushrooms, asian greens, steak with chimichurri (my favourite !!) , and duck & lamb dumplings.\n\nHonestly every bite was so goood!

However, I  absolutely loved the spicy crispy shrimp and definitely ate more than my share. The scallops were also good but wished they were colder. \n\nUnfortunately, the ribs and wings were both salty - the latter so salty that we couldn't eat more than a bite. We informed our server and she said she would let the kitchen know. No one came back with an apology, or new wings, and they were on our bill. Not the biggest deal but just kind of dampened the service, which otherwise was pretty good.

What is there not to love about Old School? Benny & the Jets with Pork Belly was just PHENOMENAL. The hollandaise sauce was deliciously sweet and topped off the egg benedicts extremely well. The pork belly was not dry at all and was packing in flavour; it was very sweet, yet savoury at the same time. These two flavours were very complimenting. I also didn't notice that there were english muffins underneath everything! They were getting a bit soggy towards the end of my meal, but that is to be expected as it was at the bottom and I also eat very slow!\n\nI assumed the home fries were ordinary french fries, but they were in fact, potato cubes. These home fries were surprisingly very enjoyable to eat. There were salted on the outside to give it a nice salty kick, and they were very crispy. There were a lot of mixed greens on the right side of the plate, with vinegar sauce (I think?) drizzled on top. The sauce made the vegetables a bit sour, which is a huge plus as the mixed greens will be very plain without it! For those who cannot afford a mobile data plan, this place has free wi-fi! \n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and it made waiting for the meals to come not a problem.

Don't forget to smother with the brown sugar butter.

I'm a sweet&savoury type of gal, so the blueberry+bacon+brown sugar butter combo sounded divine! As expected, the bacon in between the pancakes deliciously broke up the sweetness from the blueberry compote piled on top. The pancakes themselves were buttermilk ones that were a normal thickness & fluffiness, which I'm not opposed to since it didn't feel too heavy in the tummy. I liked how they had additional maple syrup on the side so you can choose to add more, but I found it perfect the way it was !\n\nMy Name is French...Toast (2.5/5) - disappointing for me because the toast was pretty dry.

Service was friendly but nothing remarkable to note. \n\nFor food, we ordered the chicken and waffles and a steak breakfast plate. I enjoyed the taste of the chicken and waffles but I found the plate was a little lacking in portions of chicken. It also could have been more visually appealing if they had added fruits or some sort of colour to the plate? I ordered the hot chocolate which was quite disappointing in flavour, it was quite watered down and I just do not recommend it. The latte wasn't too bad. But, I do note that the drinks and food are quite pricey for what you get. To me, I didn't find the price to be worth what I got from the overall dining experience.

Unfortunately I received a can with mold on the rim. It was promptly replaced and the waiter apologized.\n\n\nFoodwise I ordered the Steak and Fries (Steak my Breath Away) $21.00.

The steak was served with garlic parmesan fries. They were so good! Crispy, Salty and a nice hint of stink from the parmesan.\n\n\nThe rest of the table enjoyed their meals as well. I was able to sample my girlfriends Fried Cauliflower.

They are certainly \"Instagram Worthy\" and they bring the wow factor to your brunch table! \n\nMy friend and I met at the restaurant and I quickly added my name to their online waitlist through Yelp. Super convenient! Unfortunately, the system wasn't working - so as we sat waiting, several people who arrived after us were seated before us. When I checked in with the host, he quickly seated us and apologized for the wait. Luckily, it was only an extra 10-15 minutes or so. Once we were seated, we also had to wait quite a while before someone came to our table, so I ended up flagging someone over for coffee and water. Our server was really nice and apologized for the wait when she came to take our order. \n\nWe ordered the blueberry pancakes and smoked salmon benedict and split them between us. I liked how they added bacon in between layers of the pancakes, as it brought a nice savory kick to balance the sweetness of the blueberries and brown sugar butter. We both enjoyed the food, but I have to be honest and say that (so far) these pancakes are the second best I've had in Toronto. I have yet to try a few more places that I've bookmarked, but the number one spot for me belongs to Sophie's on Bayview. (Sorry, Old School) \n\nThe restaurant itself is nice and spacious, and we didn't feel too squished, although I did see a few tables that seemed a bit too close to each other. I always worry I'll knock something off the table beside me trying to squeeze past. Despite the fact that it was super busy and a bit noisy, we could still have a normal conversation without shouting at each other. \n\nService was super friendly although a bit slow, but it seemed that the staff were all working their butts off to keep everyone happy.

They handled a bunch of yelpers asking questions, and taking pictures very well and made sure everyone got to try all the foods that came by. Special shout out to the bartender/manager Orlando who was very friendly and knowledgeable yet valued our feedback and opinions. \n\nThe first dish I got to try was the mushroom and goat cheese arancini. It was absolutely incredible! Crunchy outside with a flavourful inside. Melted in your mouth and served perfectly warmed throughout. So good I had seconds! Tied for my favourite dish of the night! \n\nThe second dish I got to try was the poutine. I found it very salty but then noticed mine had very little gravy. I did like how the cheese curds were incorporated throughout and not just placed on top. My boyfriend's poutine had a generous portion of gravy so I tried his. The gravy made all the difference! It was good and cut down on the salty taste. Overall I found the poutine good but not amazing. \n\nNext up was the pulled chicken slider. The sauce was flavourful and delicious. It helped prevent the sandwich from being too dry. I also appreciated that the bun held up to the sauce and didn't get soggy.\n\nThe soya sauce cauliflower was tied with the arancini for my favourite dish! We were told it contained soya sauce so I was expecting something salty. Instead i rated a Sweet honey flavour with a touch of salt of the soya sauce. I had seconds of this as well, just couldn't resist!\n\nThe Big Mac slider was a bit disappointing. I do give them points for including a pickle but the burger itself was quite dry. The sauce on it was good but it just didn't work together as well as the pulled chicken I found. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was the most disappointing dish of the night. It had a good amount of sauce which I enjoy, but the whole dish lacked flavour. I did notice that it is regularly served with both orange and white cheese and this was all white so Mabey that's why?\n\nThe last food dish I got to try was the Caprese salad. I'm not a big fan of caprese salad in general but this one was pretty flavourful.

I'm not a gin person but the Grapefruit fizz had such a strong grapefruit flavour I enjoyed it. I didn't notice I was even drinking gin, it tasted very fresh!

And among the 3, the best one for me is the Pan-fried Pork. The skin is not thick and just right and not doughy, the soup is flavourful  and hot and the filling is cooked which is the opposite of the Steam Pork Soup Dumpling.

First set of drinks alone took nearly 30 minutes. Rock shrimp tempura was a joke though, literally no seasoning used we had to dip it in soy sauce to salvage it. You could also count the tiny pieces of cut up wagyu in the fried rice which was hilarious. \n\nThe must try's definitely blew us away with how much flavour was packed in each dish, particular the Kasa Moto roll and fried chicken. If you want something a bit spicy, tangy and saucey but not too heavy the fried chicken is a must! Comes with 6 boneless pieces so although extremely saucey, it's easy to eat neatly. The Gimme Moto was recommended by the server and the egg whites made the most velvety texture that brought this peach whiskey sour to another level even guys were double ordering this drink. \n\nService\nOur server was in charge of maybe 6-7 tables in one area which was not practical on a Saturday night. She never came to our table nor did she remember what we ordered so she didn't realize some dishes had yet to come after we finished everything. I didn't appreciate how many times she felt the need to ask us the few times she did come by if we wanted another round of drinks when we were no where near finished our current drinks. \n\nNot the best experience, regardless if it was a birthday or not.

Nice because you get to try everyone else's food. But still, I wish they had some sort of bento box option where you actually get a coherent meal. I find the shared plates a little bit of a mish mash. We ended up having edamame, roasted peppers, beef, and I think fish or chicken. I can't remember. Each dish ok on its own but um not really what I would call a great meal. Oh yes, we also got a small bowl of rice to share...and there was still some left over.

The sake sangria was way to sweet, I added soda water which made it drinkable but by no means delicious. The rock shrimp tempura was too salty and rich. There's a mayo dressing which makes it a bit too heavy with the breading. The lettuce wraps were also really salty and had bits of lemon or grapefruit which I took out.

The appetizer only had 4 thin slices of salmon. The main course was just a few diced pieces of the lamb shoulder on a bed of A LOT of rice. I had an impression that it would be with a side of rice to be honest - but the ratio of lamb and rice was like getting fried rice at a Chinese restaurant. The main also had an onion cut in quarters, which seemed a little odd to me. Onions have such great flavour, but it looked like the chef only used it as a garnish. Finally, the dessert was the size of a 2-bite brownie. I finished it in exactly 2 bites so I would know. \n\nTo add to my disappointment was how the main course tasted. The lamb shoulder had the WORST gamey and greasy taste. The first bite of it I could tell it wasn't right. The overwhelming taste of the meat was too much. I just couldn't finish it. It tasted like it came straight from the farm and I didn't like that. \n\nOn top of it all, I only saw the server when he came to bring the dishes.

I've heard some mixed reviews about Kasa Moto - mostly about how it is overrated with \"mediocre food\" - that is only half true. I do agree with the part where everyone says that Kasa Moto is overrated - it is - but food isn't all too bad. It's just okay. Drinks are good though. The calamari and matcha cold noodles that we had were quite good. I was more so disappointed in the wagyu and the salmon sashimi. The two pieces of sashimi was like $12 - so one piece of normal sized sashimi is $6. 6 fucking dollars for a sliver of sashimi supposedly shipped fresh from Norway. I was hoping to get something more substantial - like maybe get two more pieces of sashimi to justify for the $12 but IMO, the sashimi that I had was only slightly better than the sashimi I would get at an average AYCE sushi restaurant. \n\nService was okay.

I had great expectations for this concept. Immediately after learning about what was going to open in this building, I felt that they were building a Toronto version of Nobu. Clearly, Nobu thinks Toronto would not be a good fit for their beautiful concept which they've opened all around the world, so somebody else had to do it. I've most recently been to the Malibu location...and let me say that the people behind Kasamoto have clearly been to Nobu Malibu as well. \n\nWe arrived for an 8:30 reservation on the patio. An outdoor staircase takes you up to this beautiful area, beautifully embellished with wood detail everywhere. There are tables and chairs all around, but we opted for the more relaxed environment - sofas. The sofas are low and have a coffee table. Very comfy. The attention to detail at this place was incredible.\n\nThe server that helped us was very friendly and accommodating. She was very patient in explaining some dishes on the menu and even changed our order when we decided we didn't want something a few minutes after we ordered it (sorry).\n\nThe food was great. Not amazing but very well done. I'm sure the menu will evolve as they learn what people like and dislike, so I can't really review the food until a second visit in a few months. The soy butter rice was too greasy and tasted somewhat bland. The sushi rolls are very good. \n\nSome people will find that it's too expensive. You're coming here for the environment and experience. A meal for two will usually hit around $200 or more with tax and tip. \n\nNow the thing I wish they would improve: the alcohol. The alcohol list was lacklustre. In particular the rum. When I asked about dark rum, they only had Bacardi Black and Havana Club 7yr. These are OK rums. If you work at the restaurant and you'd like to please your rum-drinking customer, please get Diplomatico rum, or at least something decent found at other restaurants - Goslings.\n\nNow in an effort to not ramble...the whole experience was good for an opening week visit. Big patio, great service, and interesting food. This restaurant will be a great success, but it needs to work on a few things...which I'm sure it will. \n\nFor now...it's a somewhat decent version of Nobu in Toronto - from the way that the menu is organized to the way your chopsticks rest on a stone on the table when you arrive, and even the wood paneling everywhere.

They're just missing the ocean behind the railing.\n\nGet a reservation while you can.", 4], ["Freshened up patio with great wait staffs.

Our appetizer - inari (rice ball from the sushi bar) arrived after 45 mins as the waitress told us there was miscommunication. We saw every table has a hold up and was wondering why. The exact reason is the sushi chef screwed up the rice.  The rice is soggy.  As a high-end Japanese restaurant, the rice is crucial. Our main course- chirashi (which is Japanese raw fish rice bowl) arrived half an hour later.  The fish is good but the rice is still soggy.  When the chirashi arrived, I already told the server please have the dessert ready.  We still have to wait for another 10 minutes for the dessert to come.  I ordered mochi which has ice cream inside. The ice cream already melted when it arrived the table.  My friend ordered strawberry shortcake, it hasn't arrived until I finished the mochi.  The waitress is very unprofessional there as I can see her swearing with the f* word with another waitress.  I understand they might be overwhelmed with the situation - raining and the order took long and lots of customers are complaining, they need to keep their professionalism. Yes, I understand I went there just for summerlicious but I won't be going back again in the near future even if it is free.  The one hour fourth five minutes lunch is really unbearable.

The noodles didn't seem to be cooked well as some of them were much shorter pieces than they should have been. I also wish it had more of a charred flavour.

It is still the best tai food you can find between Sheppard to steels, but not the best quality. I think they're best dish among the 4 we ordered, was the green curry, no complaints on that.

I found their food was a ok, but it's more authentic than commercial Thai restaurants and since there aren't any good Thai restaurants around this neighborhood, I didn't mind paying little extra for better food.\n\nHowever, I recently went there and was shock with their changes. Place was still the same old disorganized small fast pace take out family restaurant with bored and occassionally sassy servers. But they made changes with the menu and now they are charging mediocre beef curry for almost $20. I mean.. do they think they are Pai restaurant? Sure, economy is tough and all but their recent changes just doesn't make any sense to me. There are no change of recipes, no ingredient upgrade, no changes of ambience, no upgraded customer services or change of house system for better service. So I'm not sure what made them think they are $20 price range restaurant but I can confidently say it is not. \n\nI'm giving extra star for being little more authentic than other Thai restaurants around the neighborhood but they seriously need to have reality check with themselves. \n\nDefinitely not going to return.", 2], ["One of my favourite French places in Toronto.

After the appetizers I expected the rest of the meal to follow the same grade. However it started to decline after that. I had the beef tenderloin which was done steak frites style. It was tender cut with a good sear. Green beans and frites really basic frites. Felt like a regular steak anywhere. Gnocchi didn't come out looking great and taste was consisted with its basic presentation. My table had other appetizers, smoked salmon, octopus kale salad, fois gras, and mains venison, pork knuckle. Consensus was acceptable but not outstanding. They really missed the mark on dessert.

Sometimes the revamp works; the mushroom soup ($10) was enriched with earthy mushroom flavor instead of heavy cream, the way it would've been in the pre-coronary-awareness 1970s. The chicken liver parfait ($12) was a light, delicious near-foam served with croutons, and tangy cornichons and four-grain mustard, both made in house.  So far, off to a five-star start.\n\nIt's when the entrees arrive that the revamping seems more about the chef's conceit than delivering what diners want. Like with New Coke and words like \"hubster,\" why do you mess with the originals if your version isn't a marked improvement?\n\nThe S.O.'s boeuf Bourguignon was deconstructed to the point of ridiculousness; chunks of braised beef were served on a plate--a plate, not a bowl!--with dollops of pomme puree and Chinese cloud ear mushrooms with barely any stewing liquid in sight.

I order my steak medium-well and in this case, I'm wishing I ordered it medium-rare. It was well cooked, but a bit tough. And we were given butter knives for our steaks. It was very awkward physically cutting my steak in a room of nineteen silent people. There was a bit of a giggle and our server came to our rescue with the knife.  I finished with the cr\u00e8me brulee, which was torted just enough to reach so I could devour its gooey centre. \nI would come back and like to try their basque chicken, duck confit and filet mignon.

The food was excellent (as expected: gorgeous duck confit), the wine selection very broad and the staff is superb. The one failing point I found was the decor, which did not present so much as authentic French, but as a chain restaurant version of French. There were some very lacklustre and cliched art choices, an overall lack of warmth and no sense of the history or patina which would have amounted to a very romantic bistro experience. Keep the herringbone floors and the lovely zinc bar, but add a few more layers.", 4], ["I had the pleasure of dining at Biff's Bistro during the most recent Winterlicious. I found the atmosphere captivating, and the service very friendly and professional. My wife and I opted in for the drink pairing, and were blown away by the quality of the food.

They ended up educating us on the various marine life we didn't know much about.\n\nThankful for the experience and staff here, I would visit again.\nDefinitely a MUST DO, when in the Toronto area.", 5], ["A definite must do for anyone visiting the Toronto area! This was an unexpectedly large and robust aquarium with a variety of rooms and aquatic species. They do a great job of making you feel immersed in the tanks, with moving conveyor belts through the large tank area, that slowing take you through the area to observe the various animals in there. They also have kids areas with touch and feel tanks, a play area, and some interactive button and screen areas. \n\nIt can be pricey if you buy it one-off, so do the city pass, and get more bang for your buck. The gift shop has some fun and cute offerings as well, so check that out before you leave.

Really fun for adults and for kids. They have a cafe and snack stands inside. They have so many beautiful sections to explore, my favorite was the large tank where you can watch turtles , various types of sharks big and small swim above your head or right up to the window ! I can't say I have been to an aquarium yet with such a large selection of sharks big and small , it was so impressive to see them so close up. their jellyfish section was beautiful as well. Each section was fun and educational as well as beautifully set up, you can even see the section where they have all the water tanks for each type of climate and breed, with an added interactive element for children or your inner child ! I was very impressed with this whole experience and I highly recommend checking it out for yourself", 5], ["I've been to the New England Aquarium in Boston many times, and a friend recommended me Ripley's saying it is way better than the NEA. Having now been to both: I prefer Ripley's, though I find myself wishing for penguins.\n\nYou start off with various smaller tanks that have specific fish communities, and placards telling you what you're looking at. This is merely a preview to the awesomeness you'll see next. Particularly memorable was the electric eel exhibit, and there was an octopus, it was just hiding from me. \n\nSoon you're passing through a large glass tunnel. Along the sides are cards telling you what kind of fish you can expect to see. When in there you are virtually surrounded by everything. Plus there's a moving walkway (only an option, it's quite small for those wishing to walk themselves) which slowly takes you through the tunnel. The \"tank\" is quite large, and water is crystal clear. \n\nAfter the tunnel you get to see the jellies! At the very end you get to see the systems that keep the water flowing cold and clean!\n\nOverall; an awesome value, great for those looking to learn a little bit, see a bunch of ocean life, or just to see a shark swimming over your head.\n\nAquarium is also open quite late!", 5], ["Small aquarium but nice to visit while in town.

The beautiful tunnels of aquatic life and views from multi levels make the steep price worth it. Visit if you want to feel like Ariel under the sea!", 5], ["This was awesome!

We made our way through the aquarium in about 45 minutes. The displays were beautiful and the tanks were large enough that multiple people could be crowded around the aquatic animals at once. We saw lots of fish, turtles, sharks, and sting rays. The jellyfish exhibit had gorgeous light effects that drew us in. For the kids, they had a crawl area in which they could experience the animals from a different view and they also had a few interactive exhibits. The moving walkway was a hit with the kids and the adults.\n\nThis is a very nice aquarium that happened to be across the street from our hotel. I loved the fact that they make Friday nights more of an event rather than just a destination.", 4], ["I'd have to say this is one of my favorite aquariums I've been too. It's a lot smaller than most but it's full with things to see. I loved that you can play with starfish. I loved that at the end of the aquarium it's open.

And I missed the shark tanks - or I couldn't find them. I would definitely return to the aquarium - but in off season. Maybe in October when it's not so hot!\n\nBut the inner geek in me loved the displays I did see. It was the tourists that ruined the experience for me.\n\nFood: I knew it was going to be bad.

The coolest part was a live squid I believe (that cleans your hands), no more need for soap! Just get yourself one of those! Lol!\n\nDrinks and finger foods were included in the price!

This area is a little congested with play area and good so close together but we made it work.

They have lots of cool exhibits with beautiful scenery.\n\nWe went on a Tuesday afternoon and didn't have to wait long at all with the City Pass. We were able to bypass the longer line with the pass.

It can be a little slow moving since you are on the moving floor; however, you are also able to walk on the side if it is going to slow for you. I really loved it. It feels like you are under the water. However, it is important to note that my fianc\u00e9 has motion sickness and started to feel a little queasy. The jellyfish was a feast of psychedelic lights.

Of all the exhibits, I think the shark tunnel was the most memorable. I thoroughly enjoyed the way the entire room was set up as it allows you to admire the marine animals from every angle. They also had this convenient conveyer belt located on the left side of the room which you could stand on giving you the option to slowly make your way through or you could walk at your own place on the right side. I honestly couldn't bring myself to leave this particular exhibit as it was just breathtaking. \n\nAlong with the shark tunnel, there were also a few interactive exhibits that allowed you to interact with the animals.

I can't even imagine this place on a weekend. \n\nAnd all those spots where you can \"pet a shark/stingray\" kinda things were packed with screaming kids the animals were so freaked out they weren't even swimming. It was legitimately sad for the animals. \n\nIt's also SUPER small. Like we walked through it and were like \"is that it? Did we finish it?\" Went upstairs, goftshop... yea... that's it.\nJust don't bother honestly. The staff was nice enough. The bathrooms were surprisingly clean.

The Aquarium itself is pretty big! It has two levels but it's easy to navigate. \n\nThey have some truly amazing displays. The tanks are tall and wide and gives you a gorgeous overview of plenty of different sea life roaming about. The Jelly Fish tank is illuminated by changing lights and it's one of the nicest ways I've seen of displaying jellyfish. \n\nTheir overhead tunnel where you can stand on the electric carpet that moves for you is also quite long. You can just stand still and look around you.\n\nIt does get busy so make sure to plan your visit on a good day. We went on June 30th and there were no schools or large groups so the visit was really relaxed. \n\nIt is a very kid friendly place but you can also enjoy it even if you don't have kids. They actually have a lot of crawl spaces for kids to make it look like they are in the tank and those are cool! I didn't care if they were for children though, I'm pretty small and made myself fit in there! \n\nFor some reason I never read any of the signs when I go to places that explain stuff (museums/aquariums/zoos) so I didn't personally learn anything during this visit but I still had a great time fish watching!\n\nThey also have an amazing gift shop!\n\nIt's a must see for anyone who loves aquariums, is visiting Toronto, has the city pass. \nI recommend doing both the CN Tower and the Aquarium on the same day (you can also squeeze in Casa Loma if your trip is short and you want to use up all your City Pass coupons.)", 5], ["We spent almost 100 dollars on tickets for three and this aquarium was overly crowded!

Oh well....hopefully you learn your lesson.\n\nDespite it being really crowded on a Monday, we truly enjoyed it. They have a huge variety of underwater creatures, including jellyfish, sting rays, and sharks. They have talks throughout the day, which are nice and there is a pretty good chance that you can see the animals being fed if you come during the day. The displays are pretty good, but my absolute favorite part has to be the moving walkway. It is the longest moving walkway in North America and it takes you through a giant tank filled with all sorts of underwater sea life. I loved it because although on a crowded day you may stand in line to get to this moving walkway, once you are on it, you no longer have to fight with people to see lots of fish. This is truly what made me bump my review from 3 to 4 stars. In sum, worth coming to if you can avoid the crowds.", 4], ["Staying at the Intercontinental Hotel on Front Street, we lucked out with our assigned room because it had a great view overlooking Ripley's Aquarium of Canada as well as the CN Tower.

Eventually, relying on directions from hotel staff combined with Google Maps pedestrian mode, we arrived at the entrance.\n\nWe love going to aquariums because watching the sea life slowly moving through the water is sort of relaxing, almost allows you to tune out the sometimes noisy kids.  Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is no exception!  They have a layout that you follow and see almost everything in 60-90 minutes if you don't feel the need to see and read everything.  But if you have the time, you could easily spend half a day here.\n\nA portion of the route has a slow moving walkway that you can stand on and always have a front row view as you are moved through the exhibits.  Of course, you can step off anytime but I like how no one can park themselves at the front blocking the view for extended periods of time.\n\nThe exhibits have a good variety of sea life to see and knowledgeable staff to answer any questions you may have.  There is a cafe or snack bar about halfway through that makes a convenient place to take a break, especially for those with little children or grumpy seniors.

I think this aquarium is better suited for 5 and up basically a child that is self-sufficient and can enjoy the interactive exhibits. Went here on a Saturday around 3pm and it was busy! We had to wait on line to buy tickets, but here is a tip: BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE even as you wait on the line. You will save yourself 30 min and get your tickets on your phone. We did this while waiting and we cut about 15 people in front of us. So it's not an open exhibit where you can walk or pick which one you want to see, you are guided through one exhibit at a time. It's kind of claustrophobic and with the crowds, it can be quite overwhelming for a toddler. This aquarium is not a relaxing one since I think the goal is to get people quickly through the museum. There are no seats or much open space to stop and take a break. It wasn't until the end before the gift shop that I was able to sit down. The best exhibits are the underground tunnel of fish which we walked through and the jellyfish. The moving platform was a line to get on and I don't think changed the experience. My toddler's favorite part was buying a shark plush animal. It was too crowded and dark to let her run around so I had to keep her in a stroller which changed the experience. I gave it three stars because of the overall experience (some highs, lots of low) and the price was really expensive for two adults $85. This is something fun to do once, but I will not be grappling to come back here again.", 3], ["I really like this aquarium.  Lots and lots of tanks.\n\nBeautiful displays.  Well thought out building layout.\n\nThe jellyfish are the best part of the show for us, but the tour through tanks to both sides and above us was pretty awesome as well.\n\nWe spent a good hour and a half in there.  \n\nHaving said that, I've been twice and the biggest struggle is that it can get very busy and congested.  It can be hard to see some of the displays because of the volume of people in front of tanks.  That and people stumbling around like drones and blocking people getting past them.\n\nI would give this place a 5 because it really is an awesome set of displays, but the sounds of giddy children and yelling adults can be a bit overwhelming if you are expecting a peaceful tour.  Better to go during off times.\n\nDefinitely an amazing experience that you don't want to miss.  Probably better to get in early and to prebuy your tickets to cut down on congestion.", 4], ["A must-go if you are in Toronto. This was the highlight of my time here.

We'd heard of it for a long time but had never visited. We were disappointed. It cost $35.99 plus tax for an adult admission, even though we visited on a day when it was quite slow. For the size of the aquarium and the number of exhibits, the cost of almost $40 for admission was very steep. \n\nOne upside was that they had a whole section dedicated to Canadian marine life. The irony, of course, is that you got to see all the fish you might also find on your plate! \n\nThey also had several exhibits that had very interesting tropical fish, including \"Nemo\" and \"Dory\"!\n\nThere were a lot of kids there the day we visited, but also a lot of adults without kids. I definitely think it's more designed for kids, which is fine, but I would have really liked to see more exhibits aimed at adults. \n\nSome downsides:\n- It's fairly small, so you'll get through it in less than 2 hours. Even quicker if you don't stop to read the signs. \n- I'm not sure if they have any educational presentations, but there were no talks or presentations when we were there. \n- There are very few benches or seats, so there's no way to sit and enjoy the exhibits for a longer period of time. \n- The gift shop has mainly toys and ecologically incorrect stuffed animals and statues. There were also no \"serious\" books available. If you were truly interested in the ecology of the animals, you wouldn't be able to get anything to help you at this shop. \n- They had nothing but fish. This may seem like a weird comment, but I've been to multiple aquariums with marine and freshwater mammals like ducks, otters, penguins, seals, sea lions, etc. This aquarium had nothing that couldn't fit in a tank of water. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend a visit unless you were able to get a significant discount.

Two giant sawfish sharks, the female weighs about 500 lbs!!! \n- Planet jellies--the jellyfish are so mesmerizing and beautiful to watch\n- Cleaner shrimp--tickly shrimp flock to your hands to eat necrotic materials plucking pieces of with their tiny tiny pincers and stuffing it in their mouths at lightning speed om nom nom\n- Little squid--it's super cute and adorable looking\n- Shark petting--definitely try this out!! \n- Dive show--diver goes into the Rainbow Reef with a lettuce and the fishes swarm around him\n- Shark feed--happens only twice a week so time your visit!! \n\nDefinitely recommend going whether and adult or kid.

This was a beach themed event but I will focus this review on the aquarium itself. This is a decent sized aquarium given that's it's not located on a body of water I can understand the limitations. However they seemed to have done a decent job with the space they have.

I LOVE spicy, and I can handle my heat../ but this place one day it's the perfect spice but the next time you go it's unbearable to swallow. They add so much spice to the point you don't even taste the chicken or any other ingredients. Last time I went was a total JOKE. Me and my friends were all so disappointed and we did not enjoy our chicken tacos. We had to chug so much water down with our tacos that we didn't even bother finishing them.

My counterpart had the tuna ceviche, which had a very strong onion-y flavour - something I personally quite enjoyed.\n\nThe restaurant itself is on the smaller side, so you might be waiting for a table during peak hours.

Also with that we got chips and guac which was great, the chips were made inhouse with the guac. The tacos itself were really good, the portions were small but it was the standard size for tacos.

That said...\n\nThis place is definitely worth coming to! My recent lunch visit made me committed to coming back to try more of the menu. I was given a complementary basket of chips & pico de gallo (not sure if this is a usual thing, or as an apology for being so busy that day), and it was something I'd totally come back and pay for - the chips are crunchy and have great structural integrity, and the pico de gallo has a REAL kick to it.

What was great about it was the hint of lime.  Was literally a hit or miss though but when you do get one with a hint of lime and just enough salt, it was pretty addicting.  4/5.\n\nBaja Fish Taco - So each taco order came with 3 tacos, so if you're with a few people, I'd recommend ordering a bunch of different ones to try out more.  The shell was nice. Didn't fall apart easily unlike some others.  The fish was a pretty good size and wasn't greasy.  Lacked a little bit of flavour but the garnishing did a great job adding flavour.  5/5.\n\nBeef Cheek - A couple of cons (for me) were the amount of oil that oozed out after each bite. The meat was a little bit on the dry side and their guacamole was incredibly watery that I originally thought that it was a sauce.  Overall though, it was really good.  Was very different from the fish taco so my tasting was pretty balanced because of that.  4/5.", 4], ["We had the opportunity to try Grand Elecric's Carnitas tacos and Guacamole & Chips. The carnitas tacos had confit heritage pork, pickled carrots, salsa verde, onion, and cilanto. The tacos weren't the best or the most traditional tacos i have had. The pork was dry and underseasoned, I had to put a lot of salsa verde and hot sauce on it. Also, it might have been easier to eat if the carrots were julienne (just a very minor issue i had lol ). The guacamole and chips were the highlight of the whole meal though; the chips were perfectly fried and salted and the guacamole was creamy and tangy.  The restuarant itself is a bit of a small fit with limited seatings and had a very loud atmosphere (mostly from the servers).

This is seriously unacceptable behavior. We spent quite alot here. Almost $200.00 on tacos, and alcoholic beverages. \n\n\nThis place I will say is the best tasting tacos in Toronto. However not the BEST tacos.\n\nThe alcoholic drinks were more bitters and light alcohol + watery. \n\nThe Squid and their Shrimp Taco would be the best out of all the items on their menu. The shrimp taco was nicely balanced with sweet, and crunchy. This goes the same for the Calamari. \n\nGuacamole dip was over seasoned with lemon leaving it to taste extremely sour. \n\nTheir chicken taco, mushroom and fish all were too sour. The do not get the right balance of flavours with these 3. \n\nOverall I would never come back again because of the rude way we were all treated.

Can get loud so drink up and yell at your guests if need be. \n\nMENU DESIGN/READABILITY: written on a chalkboard above the bar, same with alcohol. You can virtually read it from anywhere in the restaurant. \n\nFOOD QUALITY: Phenomenal. Some of the best tacos you'll get in Toronto no question. They double up the soft tortillas too which is a good look. My favourite tacos in order: Beef cheeks, fish (typically baha), and pork tinga. If they have the miami ribs on special get them they are outrageous. The crispy brussel sprouts are also among some of the best items I have gotten here. Ceviches can be hit or miss, but overall very tasty and well executed (I'm a ceviche snob). On the table is salsa verde and a Mexican hot sauce which I believe is called Valentina, I put both on everything including intermittent squeezes of fresh lime wedges. In house guac is fresh and tasty I'd also recommend ordering the guac + chips to start. \n\n**check the pics for the Fried Squid and Peanut-Hoisin Rib special pics, they will have you sold!\n\nBOOZE: Tons of Bourbon, tequila, beer, wine and cocktails. The house cocktail GE Sour is incredible: Vanilla bourbon, agave, egg whites, lemon. Unreal, I can crush through 5-6 without realizing it. \n\nPRICE POINT: Fair price point. I believe prices went up and now tacos are 3$ piece which is fair. Patrons often complain about food prices but they don't take into consideration where the ingredients are bought from, the time it takes to come to an end product (marinating, braising, labour). Come to think of it, 3$ is damn good. All around fair prices considering what you are getting. \n\nSERVICE: Good.\n\nBATHROOMS: clean, average. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: a beautiful hip taqueria in Parkdale, well executed with such tasty food, what more could you want?\n\n***wait on a Friday/Saturday eve can be up to 3 hours, go for lunch or be there 15-30 prior to when they open. \n\n***Now open for lunch 7 days a week from 11:30a-4:30p!", 5], ["We had the zucchini salad, spicy chicken wings, pork belly tacos, fish taco, spicy chicken tacos.

Get it.", 3], ["Wow there's definitely a reason why this is the most reviewed restaurant in Toronto. Definitely call in with a reservation to this place because it was packedddddd. First of all the place was HUGE. When you walk in it looks like a very small shop but don't be fooled. The vibe felt extremely homey and vintage. I loved it.\n\nI ordered the Tea Mac cocktail which was basically an alcoholic Thai tea and it was amazing. I could barely taste the alcohol it was so good. I also ordered the Tom yum soup which was fantastic. The portion was smaller but it was the perfect amount of spice. For the entree I got the Khao Soi, I was blown away. I typically don't love curries but this was a very light chicken coconut curry with noodles. It was soooo good. And for dessert we got the egg custard sticky rice. Probably some of the best Thai food I've ever had in my life.", 5], ["Food is really good, I can't think of a better Thai restaurant in Toronto. Very reasonable prices.\n\nI've been here a couple of times and the service however has never been amazing, and the last time it was pretty poor. We were seated maybe an hour before closing and had one of the worst experiences with a server at any restaurant. Rude and water was never filled even though it wasn't too busy at the time. The table next to us was asked if they wanted anything before the kitchen closed but the server simply walked by our table, as if we'd done something to upset her.\n\nReally disappointed as the food is great but this experience has given me mixed feelings.", 1], ["Pai has its fair share of rave reviews, and I have to agree for the most part. I've been 4-5 times before and it's always busy. There is ALWAYS a wait if you're going to walk in. We went on a Saturday night and surprisingly only waited 15 min for a table for 2. I've had to wait for over an hour during previous visits. Pai makes you feel like you're on a street in Thailand, experiencing their vibrant street foods. Service is casual and friendly - they are always super busy so I was satisfied with the level of attention from the wait staff. \n\n1) squash fritters - a crispy delicious finger food, served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I just found the fritters a little mushy towards the middle, I wish the whole fritter was as crispy as the edges. \n2) pad Thai - excellent!! One of the best pad Thais I've had, super balanced flavours and the medium spicy was perfect for us. \n3) green curry - served in a young coconut, I did not really enjoy this. The curry was watery and the chicken was very dry. The only part I enjoyed was scraping the coconut pulp out of the shell.", 4], ["WOW!! Completely understand why this restaurant has such amazing reviews. We arrived here around 7:15pm and only waited 15 minutes before being seated. There's a designated area for those waiting for seating so customers aren't standing around the entrance. \n\nWe ordered the spring rolls (vegetarian), Chef Nuit Pad Thai, and Khao Soi. For the dishes, you're able to select the level of spiciness as well. This was my first time trying Khao Soi at any thai restaurant and I was blown away! The broth was creamy and the dishes were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. \n\nDefinitely one of our favorite meals in Toronto.", 5], ["Came here on a Monday at lunch and it was really busy. I love the cool, hipster vibe of this place, it feels very casual, has really cool decor, theres a bar and overall it just feels comfortable.\nWe ordered the Papaya Salad which I really liked. The papaya is soaked in tamarind sauce giving it a sweet & sour taste, it came with flavourful shrimp chips, crispy pork grinds, some noodles and cabbage. Everything eaten together tastes so good! Definitely recommend!\nI had the Masaman Beef Curry, at first the bowl looks kind of small but its actually very filling. They give you a lot of beef (perfect for meat lovers) and its very tender. The curry tastes like regular curry but with a hint of sweet&sour tamarind which I really liked.\nMy friend had the Khao Soi and to me it was just ok, it tastes like a regular coconut curry. Reminds me of a Malaysian Laksa.", 4], ["Everyone who said I HAVE to come here when visiting Toronto was RIGHT! \n\nWe got the beef pad Thai, the chefs Khao soi. The Khao soi is like a pumpkin coconut creamy curry with noodles! Both were extremely flavorful and DELICIOUS with such big servings for the price. These were so good that we ordered take out with the beef braised curry and another pad Thai. \n\nThe spice levels aren't THAT bad actually. I would say average spice eaters could definitely handle mild/medium levels. \n\nThe waiters were all friendly and accommodating! You HAVE to make a reservation the DAY before! It gets packed on the weekdays right at 5 PM. The winter dog drink was like a blue lemonade. Will miss this place SO much in America", 5], ["This place is busy busy busy, I'm pretty sure they take reservations so take advantage of that if possible.\n\nThe food is surreal, tried so many of their menu offerings, with all coming out on top!

Pai came up three times during our stay. After an hour's wait, we were seated at the bar, a great location to see all the food come from the kitchen.

Arrive not hungry so that the wait doesn't get the best of you, well worth it.", 5], ["Super packed on a Monday evening. Grateful for the coat hangers. It's the small things.\n\nTwo of us split the pork skewer appetizer. VERY\u00a0 good with a slightly sweet taste. My friend liked her pad thai. I always end up getting pad thai so opted for the Thai fried rice. It was good enough and comforting but I probably should have paired that with a curry etc. Portions are massive; there's no way you can finish one main per sitting. Service was OK; fine in the beginning, but then we had to wait for 15 minutes to place a takeout order, another 10 minutes to get our bill. After dropping off the bill the server sprinted away before we could ask for the machine. Add another 5 minutes.\n\nWill be back to try the fritters though.", 4], ["I am blown away. I don't remember why I thought it deserved a 3 star.\n\nCame here during lunchtime on a weekday and we didn't have to wait. There's actually a whole another big room behind the main area!\n\nThe khao soi was amazing. Very rich sweet salty soup full of coconut taste and flavourings. The noodles were tender and the crispy noodles were fried perfectly. So delicious, recommend! Waiter was really passionate and friendly too.", 5], ["This is a huge restaurant and it was quite busy during the time we visited despite it being mid-day. \n\nThe service was lackluster, as it took awhile to be acknowledged by our waitress after we were seated.  Once she came by for drink orders it was awhile before the drinks came out and one was not included and had to be asked for again. Speaking of drinks, the Thai Ice Tea was fantastic! \n\nThe food was superior to the service however, so it is definitely worth a visit if you are nearby.", 3], ["It's insanely busy every day of the week! You'll likely be waiting for a table any time of day, but the food is worth it.\nFood is really tasty, good for sharing and trying a few different dishes.

Great selection of beers and not your typical Thai dishes, one of the best Thai places I've been to in the city", 4], ["Simply the best Thai food I've ever had. The Tom yum is just perfect.\nThe Crispy pork Pad Kra Pao is so comforting.\nNice drink selection, good vibe, great service.", 5], ["Make a reservation! This place is Hot crazy busy!  There were long lines of ppl waiting for tables as we were leaving. I do have to say it is worth the wait.  Because it is located downtown expect traffic.  And getting into a garage for parking is kind of a pain, but once the food arrived we forgot about the stresses of getting there on time. \nThe food is very authentic and true to form. It's not often you can say that when it comes to Thai food. It was just insanely tasty.  So good in fact we ordered food to go, since we knew we wouldn't be returning.  The pad Thai for breakfast was still phenomenal by the way. \nExpect nothing but exceptional flavors.  Our service was good, I do feel it could be a little better but given they were jam packed and there wasn't an empty seat anywhere in the restaurant it's understandable.", 5], ["If you're looking to try \"authentic\" Thai food you gotta eat anything with shrimp paste it, and this is the very joint that has many dishes with it.\n\nAnnnd sadly I can't eat shellfish anymore but I grew up not allergic to shrimp, so I live to tell. Never mind. My heart is won over by the Chang Mai beef noodle for how limey and mouth-wateringly spicy it is. The thin threads of fine rice noodle held the hot and sour flavours so well. They also don't skimp on ingredients and gave me many tender beef shank chunks to stuff me full for the rest of the day. My partner had the shrimp khao soi and was equally impressed. We left with happy tummies.", 5], ["Really loved that place! It's easy to find a restaurant with good thai food, but it's not that easy to find a thai restaurant that has a nice mood. I often find that thai restaurant are too simple or too formal.\n\nThe crowd is pretty young, mostly people in their 20s. Staff is also super dynamic and the food was awesome.\n\nPAI is the kind of place that as soon as you step inside the restaurant, you can smell the good food, see people having fun and you just know right away that you came to the right place.", 5], ["Should I even have to tell you how good Pai is? Aren't 2K and counting reviews enough lol\nAnd yeah true to it's amazing rating Pai doesn't ever disappoint.\nBeen here a few times over the years and haven't once been disappointed nor has the taste changed.\nAlways get their sangria which has some delicious lychees! Another favourite of mine is the Grabong or squash fritters. They come with this delicious tangy dipping sauce!\nHave tried their noodle bowl, pad Thai, green curry, fish plate and on my last visit tried the red curry and as usual wasn't disappointed.\nDessert was the mango and sticky rice which was heavenly! The fried banana is also excellent.\nWait staff are great, super attentive and caring. Answer all questions and provide recommendations.\nA must visit if you are in Toronto!", 5], ["So glad my guy finally decided to try Thai food, and pai of all places!\n\nI've only heard good things from this place. I had the pad Thai with chicken, mild spicy, and he had a beef curry with rice.\n\nHis beef curry was pretty spicy and it eventually gave a kick near the end. Portions were a good size! We felt full but not bursting at the seams. He did have food coma later.\n\nI had the pad Thai and it was p lit. The peanuts were actually underwhelming but the tamarind sauce gave a nice umami flavour to the whole thing. Good ratio of meat to noodles and the banana leaf was a nice touch :) a tad salty though... I downed a ton of water near the end and needed gum.\n\nOverall a great place for a cute date idea. Come at opening time to secure a seat because this place gets packed really fast!", 4], ["Expensive (dinner), over-crowded, bad air-quality and food was okay-ish. I've tried Pai multiple times and I still don't understand why it deserves such a huge crowd. The interior is dark, crammed, and extremely loud. This is not a great place for socials (dates/friends/family). You almost have to yell for someone to hear you. If you want to eat Pai, go very early, eat, and get out ASAP. It's just not a great environment. I especially don't like the fact they limit the reservations so you pretty much have to book 1 month in advance if you want to reserve online (which explains the line because no one could reserve).\n\nAs for the food, it's about 4 stars for certain items and some 3 stars. They are not bad, but not like the best Thai either. The food decor is nice yet the Khao Soi beef I had was dry and hard to chew. Food portions is also quite small, you'd definitely need appetizers. For the price that it charges, I don't think it's a good deal.\n\nPai has really good location and it's the closest Thai restaurant to the Financial District, that's why it attracts all these office workers. But it doesn't live up to its hype. I recommend going to Khao San Road nearby for much better quality food, ambience, prices, service and quantity.", 3], ["Are you a foodie? Do you want Thai food? Look no further! \n\nWish I could have tried more, but I was all by myself. Lol I started off with the atom Yum soup. Surprisingly, this was my favorite dish. The soup was super flavorful, and full of fresh and delicious vegetables & shrimp. Perfect combo of sour and spice. \n\nMain course - pad Thai with beef. Definitely the best ps Thai I've ever had. Perfect noodles, well balanced ingredients, and great flavor. I ordered it with farang spice (regular spice), I thought it was delicious, but next time I'll order the Thai spice. \n\nGreat prompt service too! I walked in around 2pm on a Wednesday. The main room was pretty busy, so I can imagine this place is swamped during average lunch and dinner hours.", 5], ["I really enjoyed this place. Great food and atmosphere. Definitely a place to go to for lunch during business hours.\n\nIf you're looking for a place that is reasonably priced in the financial/entertainment district with tasteful food, surrounded by casual diners, this is the place to eat.", 4], ["One word - AMAZING!!  We have ordered from here so often that we have had every dish on their menu and I can honestly say that everything is delicious. Our favourites are: their fried fish (they make it with the batter so light and fried to perfection that the fish remains flaky and just delish); pad thai (absolutely no ketchup here and always leaves me craving more); beef brisket (perfect combo of spice to sweetness); beef salad (OMG refreshing and delicious); and pork satays (made with oyster sauce these morsels of pork are so addictive I could eat the entire order myself).", 5], ["Craving authentic Thai food that's not just Pad Thai? Looking for a place to try some amazing cocktails while trying amazing food? Well Pai is your place then! Decided to go here during the holiday season so as expected it was busy. I'd definitely recommend getting reservations or even trying and calling in an hour before you want to eat to just get your name on the waiting list. They have a system where they can text you when the table is ready so that's definitely helpful. The wait time for us (group of 6) was about 50 mins to an hour. While waiting, we decided to explore their drink menu. Pai has a great selection of cocktails with a bunch dedicated to the Toronto Raptors so being the Raptors fan I am, I had to try one and it was amazing. I got the JV12 which was their take on a mojito. For appetizers, we initially tried to get the Miang Kung but they were all out of it. Then we decided to get the Kung Tawt Samoon Prai, which then we were told was not available as well. We finally settled for the cocktail shrimp but I should it was mediocre with nothing special. For the main dishes, we tried the Chef Nuit Pad Thai and the Khao Pad Thamada. The flavour on both of the dishes were amazing but in terms of quantity, my partner and I could've gone for another plate. So if you're looking for large quantity over amazing quality, then you will be disappointed. We both got the Farang Spicy and I should say it just tickled my taste buds and I could've definitely gone for the Phet Mak Mak. The quality of service was average to fair with nothing exceptional with a lot of room for improvement. The hostess did not seem like she was having a great day and our server seemed a little unorganized at times.", 4], ["New favorite Thai place and I'm originally from Thailand! I used to go to Khao San road but come here now because 1) takes reservations (I hosted my birthday party there for 15 ppl and they have a private section in the back and they work with you to figure out the menu and service was great) and 2) the food is better! The pad Thai here was surprising great compared to Khao sarn road and my cousin who just came from Thailand approved. Same for the som tum with salted crabs like that's one of my favorite street thai dishes but the problem with eating it in Thailand is the crabs might have parasites so I don't really eat it there but there's no parasites in these crabs here obviously! They also have sticky rice here and always present the food so wonderfully. Love their pad kraprao too but sometimes too spicy than I can handle bcos I have been in Canada for too long. But still good! Service is pretty good but they're always really busy so it's a tiny bit slow but if you call them they come over. They also host a bunch of parties throughout the year so if I lived in Toronto I would totally go!", 4], ["Heard Pai was branched out from Khao San Road.

I would go to Pai for the Khao Soi and drinks, but Khao San Road for the other stir fried dishes.", 4], ["Officially worst customer service in TO.  Been here plenty of times, including all the other thai hot spots littered throughout the core.  Tried this place on a weekday, it did disappoint for the first time, and in a big way.\n\nWas in the mood for Panang but hadn't seen it on the menu, so asked the waitress.  Her answer was it's not on the menu but they have it ready, so I agreed.\n\nWhen it came, the portion size was ridiculously small - half that of curries on the dinner menu i've ordered.  Waitress hadn't been seen for quite some time - to the point my date's pad thai was getting cold, so eventually I had to get up and get her.  She then tells me it was the lunch item (which is the same price as the dinner, but much smaller portions).  I was a little confused as none of this was mentioned to me when I ordered.  I asked to speak to a manager, as the waitresses solution is to order another lunch item (at dinner).\n\nThe manager, Mike, was extremely rude.  Request was simple, provide a dinner portion at dinner - or tell me ahead of time otherwise I never would have ordered it.  His response was the plates are already prepared for lunch by the chef and he cant provide dinner sizes at that point - as one would think you simply take a spoon, scoop, and put in bowl.  He was kind enough though to say I can pay for another one, like any top shelf manager.  This is when I understood I was provided something prepared 8 hours ago in a lunch plate which was later warmed up for my order.\n\nHis approach was confrontational, and quite pompous - completely incapable of seeing the issue - insisting Pai did me the favour by giving me something not on the menu - made 8 hours ago.  I handled it politely knowing I was done with Pai; unfortunately his attitude was something else - actually insisting not to ruin my evening by being unhappy with their dinner.\n\nIt's funny, I get the feeling his attitude and lack of customer service came from Pai being an example of being too popular for their own good.  Eventually Pai won't be the spot to go to for thai food, eventually there will be others that aren't owned by the same people who can't stop opening thai restaurants; and it will all start to fail with people like Mike, who lack the ability to see the customer's perspective and lacks overall people skills.\n\nSee ya Pai - you were good while you lasted - until you showed your true colors.

I get the khao soi  with braised beef.  I do think that they should give more noodles because I am always left with leftover beef and no more noodles! The braised beef is tender and tasty,  and the soup base is coconutty perfection.  Don't be afraid to order spicy... It isn't really that spicy in my opinion, and gives a nice kick.  I have also ordered the gaeng masamam with  beef, which is okay but nothing special.  It's a basic Asian tasting curry. The Thai ice tea is yummy and compliments the food.  It reminds me of cha time's original milk tea but with a slightly different flavour. Similar though.  I think my favourite on the menu has to be the Tom yum soup.

There's so much turnover that almost every day someone new is being trained on the cash register. This slows things down so much that for those of us just looking for a quick morning stop in, Le Gourmand isn't an option. I can only wonder what's happening internally that you have so much turnover, but given how unhappy your employees look, it might be time to reassess your treatment of them.\nNote that I realize many cafes have high turnover but I've never seen it to this degree.

But, I don't think there are many places in Toronto where you can get a great croissant so you'll have to settle for this place. We had the Almond croissant, which I believe just had some shaved almonds sprinkled on top and a regular croissant.\n\nAll the other things on their menu are pretty expensive for what you get.

I'm one of those weird people who'd rather have a cookie be overbaked than raw, because raw dough skeeves me out.  If the outside of a cookie is burnt and the inside is raw, I think the baker shouldn't try to be overambitious by building up the height of the cookie.  \n\nThe cookie base was great.  The ingredients were great quality.  They were generous with the chocolate.  The cookies were massive and, as I mentioned, sky-high.  But I really didn't like that they were burnt.  I ripped off the bottom thirds of my cookies as a result, and for a pricey $3 cookie...that just didn't sit well with me.  \n\nBy the way, these cookies are $3 each, which is expensive, but they're also huge, heavy, and filling.

Creative take on their dishes, absolutely delicious and surprisingly cheap!    \nStaff was nice and friendly, cool/quiet atmosphere.  Definitely coming back.", 5], ["Me and a coworker decided to take a long stroll along the Harbourfront, and obviously it takes a toll on you. Hungry, we decided to look around and found this tiny restaurant tucked in a corner along the way near the streetcar stop. \n\nThe ambience is a very relaxed and modern setting, and we were greeted by a very quirky and bubbly server who was happy to seat us! \n\nI decided to order the poke bowl after browsing their Instagram page on what the different menu items look like (it was really really good by the way) while my coworker went in for the bison burger. \n\nThe poke bowl consisted of this nice ginger and soy sauce tossed with black rice, and came with chunks of tuna and mango. Nice touch! It is definitely one of the better ones I've had. It was a little pricey, ringing up at  $17, but soooooooooooo goooooood. \n\nThe bison burger, as he described it, was literally \"juicy\". The bun was nice and soft, while the meat was very thick, yet tender. He would not stop digging into it, that's for sure. The in house ketchup was a nice touch as well, and the fries that came along with it was quite alright!\n\nAll in all, what made our lunch/dinner good was the service and the staff. Everybody was quite friendly and we had a few laughs and moments with our server. Needless to say, that long walk was definitely worth it.", 5], ["What a hidden gem!

Luckily, I brought a large group so I could sample as many menu options as possible.  Although they suggested sharing plates, I really wish I didn't because everything was on point and mouth watering (I didn't want to share!).  From the \"Poke Bowl\" (my fav by far!) to \"The Sultan\" to the \"Bison Patty\", everything was jam-packed with flavor.  The venue itself was extremely inviting and I can only imagine how popular this place is going to be once the spring/summer months hit.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone (foodie or non-foodie) and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Once again...get the Poke Bowl!", 5], ["Great spot. Worth checking out for sure. They are getting a patio so should be much more noticable in the summer. Food is amazing and they have enough space to throw decent sized events. There isn't much to choose from on Queens Quay so this is a much needed addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to going back.", 5], ["I stopped by here for dinner the other night and the food was solid.  Overall, the menu was extremely creative and full of flavor.

Also, the restaurant had a great vibe and they had great beers on tap.", 5], ["My dining experience here far exceeding my expectations. From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty.

Perfect ambience after a long day of viewing your beautiful city.", 5], ["Bar Sybanne is definitely one of the best restaurants that I have tried this summer.

Between the four of us we ordered 7 dishes. The first two appetizers came out pretty quickly. Then it was an uncomfortable 25 min wait for the next 2 small dishes. Another 10 min and another small dish. Then another 30 min for the lamb followed lastly by the rice which took over 1 hour to arrives.  None of the dishes could really be eaten together due to the huge amount of time between dishes coming out. The dishes are pretty small with the exception of the rice which came so late it was pointless.\n\nThe hallumi was too salty. We also ordered two of the nights specials the brussel sprouts (too oily and salty) and the lamb (it was dry).\n\nWe followed up on our food a few times we just got generic apologies, like the kitchen is really behind.\n\nThe food was just ok but the timing of the was unacceptable.

We ordered the lamb kofta, labneh and patatas bravas. All solid hits.\n\nThe drinks were on point. I tend to ask what they recommend for my palette and I enjoyed a several cocktails rounds of ethreets garden and ode to Alba.

Avoid.", 4], ["** This is a 3.5 star review **\n\nThis was a pretty good middle eastern meal, with some flavourful foods! The highlights were the halloumi (although I think there should be more than 3 pieces provided, as you generally share amongst 2 people), the eggplant dip and the Brussel sprouts. The cocktail was delicious. \n\nThe rest of the meal was average, which included the chicken with pumpkin, saffron rice and Israeli salad. For dessert, I had the boudini, which was good. Overall, I would say it was a pretty expensive meal, but it was good.\n\nThe presentation of the food is beautiful. \n\nService was friendly and the chef is the owner. He comes out a lot to check on his patrons, which is a nice touch in the highly competitive restaurant world. The chef is creative with his ingredients, which is also nice to witness.", 3], ["Tried Bar Sybanne with my friends. \n\nThe highlight of the night was the Labneh with the housebread (flat bread).

Service was ok - we had to check up on our order a few times though.", 3], ["I made a reservation here for 6pm on a Friday and I was only one of two tables. Apparently this place doesn't get busy until post 8pm ish. The menu is set up like tapas/family style. I expected the dishes to be small, but was pleasantly surprised when the actual dishes came out. They were actually quite substantial. \n\nThe must trys are the brussel sprouts and braised short ribs. You won't regret it.\n\nI recommend 4 dishes for 2 people", 5], ["Bar Sybanne is a wonderful addition to the already-booming Ossington strip's restaurant scene. The inside has beautiful Mediterranean / Moroccan-inspired decor (including the plates, bowls, and utensils).\n\nThe Grilled Fish with Romesco Sauce and Pomegranates is tasty and perfectly grilled. Saffron Rice is aromatic and colourful; it includes apricots, sultanas, pistachios, and edible flowers. The Fried Brussels Sprouts Leaves with Dates & Almonds is a must-get item on the menu! Even those with aversion to brussels sprouts ended up really liking this dish. The crunchy fried brussels sprouts leaves & almonds balance really nicely with the slightly sweet, soft dates.", 4], ["I rate restaurants based on food and customer service. Bar Sybanne completely failed on the latter, thus the 2 stars. \n\nI made a reservation for 4 people but learned few hours before that my friend and her date could not make it. Could not change the reservation through OpenTable and noone was answering their phone. So when we arrived at the restaurant and told the hostess that it will be only be table for 2, she told us in a very annoyed tone that she wishes that we told her earlier because there is no table for 2 available (looked around and the restaurant is empty and there is even noone seating at the bar). They eventually sat us at our table for 4. We ordered, the food came, and we started eating. After an hour, our waiter asked us if we can move to the bar because there is a party waiting for the table. We said we will finish quickly and when we asked the bill, it was right in his hands as if he could not wait to get us out of there fast enough. Once we paid, another person asked if we are done eating and if they can clean the tables. I mean again, there are few empty tables in the restaurant. I feel we were being punished because of our friends who did not show up. \n\nWe ordered the hummus, meatballs, halloumi and lamb kofta. The best dish is the lamb kofta and the rest is nothing memorable or you can't get from other mediterranean place. Not sure why this place is super arrogant especially when then food is not superb. I'd rather go to Byblos or Mamakas.\n\nWill not go back to this place for sure. It leaves a bitter taste that you are forcing customers to leave even if there are available tables. We could have sat at the bar which was empty to begin with if they asked us in the beginning. I understand that changes in reservations screw up the planning for the restaurant but that is just part of the business and they should have a strategy in place to deal with that.", 2], ["Bar Sybanne is located on the edge of Ossington strip (very close to Dundas) and our visit was a pleasant one and a nice surprise.\n\nThere were three of us, and together we had a fennel salad with orange and pomegranate (unique and refreshing), a picketed veggie dish (carrots and beet juice infused cauliflowers), a grilled whole fish (really liked the sauce on the side), a halloumi dish, and a fried Brussel sprouts with almond slices (sooo good!). every dish is crafted and presented elegantly. It's unique, delicious and impressive. The highlights are definitely the Brussels sprouts and the whole fish. I think this might have been the best modern middle eastern restaurants in Toronto. \n\nWill come back!", 5], ["Needless to say, I was blown away. \n\nBar Sybanne has been on my 'to-try' list for the longest time. I have finally gotten around trying this place out last weekend. The verdict is that this restaurant is now on my list of favourites in Downtown Toronto! \n\nLots of great photos have surfaced when I was searching up this restaurant. A lot of reviews compared this with other great Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurants like Byblos. I had quite an expectation going in especially after having read so many 5-star reviews.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite small. Seats are limited, and reservations are not easy.  Make sure to book at least a week in advance. We got seated by the window at one of their high top tables. It was not exactly the most spacious, but the coziness of the place does give you that feeling of  eating at a local restaurant in the crowded medina of Fez. It brought back good memories from Morocco and Turkey. \n\nThe menu was quite small - perfect for those with selection-phobia. We decided to go with more than what we would usually order. We got the eggplant dip, Halloumi cheese, Brussel sprouts, grilled mushrooms, saffron rice, and the grilled fish along with 6 drinks. Needless to say, we devoured everything on the table. \n\nFor appetizers: \n\nThe eggplant with the flat bread was a great starter for the table. The eggplant was seasoned well and the flatbread was warm and fresh. The halloumi cheese was grilled just right that the bite was just perfect, not too tender and stringy. It was served with a sweet homemade marmalade . The mushrooms were seasoned perfectly - sweet and savoury with a touch of tanginess. The brussel sprouts also exceeded our expectations. \n\nFor mains (which stole the spotlight of the night)\n\nThe saffron rice was out of the world.  I don't usually eat rice or that much carbs to begin with, but I am pretty sure I cleared at least 1/3 of that dish by myself. The rice was cooked perfectly.  The aroma of the dish filled the room as it was served.  The saffron spice was so fragrant that you can smell it from a mile away.  Every grain was infused with such rich saffron flavour. It was topped with fresh pomegranate, pistachio, apricots and raisins.  It didn't only taste delicious, but it also looked beautiful. \n\nNext was the grilled fish. It was grilled perfectly, presented and plated nicely, and tasted absolutely amazing. I love fish, and this dish did not disappoint. \n\nI am looking to making another reservation with them soon to try the rest of the menu. This place is definitely up there with one of the best restaurants in Toronto!", 5], ["We got the fish, Brussels sprout, and the rice. \nThe fish was definitely a good value at 25$ for the whole fish. My favourite dish were the Brussel sprouts. Crispy, flavourful, delicious. The date pur\u00e9e made it a little sweet balancing out the bitterness of the Brussel sprouts. The almonds added a nice crunch to it too. \nThe saffron rice was not exactly to our liking. There was apricot, raisins, pistachios, and pomegranate. The dish was very pretty but were not used to the spices in it. \n\nTheir dishes are great for sharing. For tapas, I'm surprised that their portions are quite large than other tapas spots I've been to", 4], ["I really liked Bar Sybanne.. A mixed fusion of Lebanese, Moroccan, Persian... among others. An assortment of experimental dishes that I feel really paid off.

We ordered the labneh and eggplant appetizer which was yummy. For our mains we ordered the fish platter, rice (was okay - it just looks nice), lamb skewers, meatballs - decent sauce, and the halloumi dish. \n\nWe were considering ordering another fish (because we were still abit hungry), however it would take another 25 mins. We decided not to because they forgot about our meatballs dish that we had ordered LOL. \n\nOtherwise, the customer service was great and we sat on the high top table right by the street which was nice.", 3], ["I decided to try Bar Sybanne on New Year Eve due to the prompt reviews on Yelp. My experience was a mixed one. The service and the ambience were fantastic, but the food did not meet my high expectation. \n\nBe prepared to provide your credit card number upon reservation. A deposit of $40pp will be charged if the reservation were to be cancelled less than 48 hours. Strict rule, but totally understandable considering the size of the restaurant. When I booked my reservation for two at 9pm, I was reminded twice that I have to finish my dinner by 11pm because the table was rebooked after that. No problem, I assured them. Turns out later I was not the one that kept the table occupied. \n\n\n\u3010Food: 3/5\u3011\nThe new year eve menu had: a dip platter, a choice of meat or veggie appetizer, three mains (to choose from five); all of which were to be shared between two guests. And then an individual dessert for everyone. Most dishes I had were presented beautifully with fusion elements, but I was not impressed by the flavour. The portion was also very small even for tapas. Looking at photos post by other reviews, the portions of some dishes on NYE menu were much smaller than they normally are. \n\n1st dish: Dip Samplers \nThis dish was the star of the evening. Three types of dips with gozleme (a flat bread similar to pita) and cucumber. The dips were hummus, eggplant and labneh. All were fantastic. My personal favourite was the eggplant. Both maple and cipollini added a natural sweetness to eggplant, making this dip extraordinarily smooth and tasty. \n\n2nd dish: Israeli Salad\nI don't understand this dish. Small pieces of chopped cucumber, tomato and raw onion were blended together by an extremely acidic vinegar. The vinegar sauce was too strong to my taste and way beyond refreshing. My taste buds hurt after eating this salad and we could not finish half of this dish. I absolutely does not recommend it unless you have a strong preference to the sour taste. \n\n3rd dish: Saffron Rice\nA very beautiful presented dish. It was very festival, with colourful ingredients including dried apricot, raisin and orange blossom. However, other than the sweet dried fruits, the taste of the rice was quite bland. I don't think this dish should be taken as a main dish alone due to its lack of flavour. Nevertheless, the portion size was generous. \n\n4th dish: Lamb Kofta\nThe lamb was juicy and delicious, but the sauce was a bit overwhelming. Portion size VERY VERY small. We basically received two pieces of small meatballs on wooden sticks... I would rather call it lamb lollipop. \n\n5th dish: Fried Chicken\nGood, but anyone who ever had popcorn chicken would not be impressed. I also found the chicken skins salty, and I suspect the chef tried to solve the problem by adding another strong flavour - the orange honey glaze was way too sweet. \n\n\u3010Drink: 4/5\u3011\nMy char special was very tasty and refreshing. My friend's English Basilica was even better. The only downside is that for some reason the English Bascilica went warm in 5 minutes. Still, I definitely would order the two drinks if I were to visit again. \n\n\u3010Ambience: 4/5\u3011\nThere were beautiful new year balloons hanging above the ceiling and candle lites on every table. The music was loud and lively. The interior design was simple. Overall, it was very dim and romantic with a modern vibe. I liked it the moment I stepped in! \n\nAlthough the restaurant went full-house on NYE, the tables and seats were kept at a comfortable distance from each other so that the guests were able to enjoy their space and privacy. I really appreciate the consideration.\n\n\u3010Service 4/5\u3011\nI wish I could give a 5/5 as our waiter Jason was incredible. Even he was occupied by multiple tables, he went above and beyond to make sure we received what we want and we had a good time. Thank you. \n\nHowever, it was obvious that the kitchen and the team could not cope with the large number of guests on NYE. We waited at least 20 minutes for each dish to come, after we finished our previous one. As we planned  to go for another occasion 2.5 hour after the dinner, I was quite anxious when I found myself waiting 30 minutes for my dessert by 11pm. In the end, we had to pay the bill first and get the dessert later to save some time. Time management is definitely something that can be improved to make Bar Sybanne better when the it is already strict with its guests' reservation and dining time. \n\nOverall, I give Bar Sybanne a 3.5/5. The drinks were good and the food were okay. I would probably give it another try during a less busy time.", 3], ["Gave my Visa number to hold a reservation for 6 last Saturday night and was warned that late cancellations may result in me being charged $40 per person for each no-show. As Saturday approached the anxiety started to build that some or all of my friends might flake at the last minute. Dinner stress....definitely a new experience for me! ;)\n\nAnyhoo, everyone showed and we proceeded to enjoy a beautiful Middle Eastern-style supper in this dimly lit, lively little spot. Dishes are dainty for sure but the flavours were on point.\n\nMusts: Fried chicken bites with orange blossom honey (!!) and crispy brussel sprout leaves.\n\nBut tbh everything else was fabulous too: halloumi cheese, Mediterranean dips, lamb kebobs, spicy meatballs, pickles....plus nice wine selection and warm service. \n\nWell done. Loved it!", 4], ["Likes:\n- Fried Brussel Leaves and Apple Cake - Must order these.\n- Very warm and attentive service\n\nDislikes:\n- I usually order hot water in place of tap water, which most restaurants offer for free, but Bar Sybanne does charge $1.00 for it. \n- Didn't really enjoy the gozleme that came with the dips, a bit on the dry side.\n- Not a big fan of salmon crudo as other fish selections would have offered more flavour, but the dish was well executed.\n\nBar Sybanne is a relatively new addition on the Ossington strip.  This is our first Middle Eastern / Mediterranean food experience and we weren't disappointed, mostly because of the amazing Fried Brussel Sprouts. The cocktails here are pretty strong, so if you're a lightweight like me, one would be enough.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes: \n- Eggplant Dip ($8) - The eggplant dip was served with gozleme, a Turkish flatbread dough. The gozleme was served nice and warm, but the texture is more on the dry and dense side. We were hoping for something more buttery and flaky. However, the eggplant dip was quite flavourful, and I really enjoyed the addition of the fragrant and sweet cipollini onions. \n\n- Fish Crudo ($12) - I thought this dish was really well executed, as the flavours of the fish shined. The chef did a great job balancing all the ingredients, particularly the use of citrus where the acidity didn't overpower the dish. The good quality olive oil coating the thin salmon slices added a very nice smooth silky texture. This is the first time I've had salmon crudo, and I must say I prefer more flavourful types of fish, such as hamachi.\n\n- Fried Chicken ($12) - This was a tasty dish, and I think the orange blossom honey should take full credit. The fried chicken itself was quite basic, served in small bite-size pieces with a nice crunch. \n\n- MUST ORDER - Fried Brussel Leaves ($11) - This was a solid dish, although it didn't surprise us from all the positive reviews. My husband and I were not only impressed with the flavours, but also the chef's ability to make the brussel leaves so thin, crispy, yet not overly oily. The dates sauce was a perfect compliment to the dish, and we were on cloud nine with every bite. We had something similar in Maui, but I must say, Bar Sybanne does it better. We would return to the restaurant again just to have this.  \n\n- MUST ORDER - Apple Cake ($10) - I'm a sucker for desserts, especially those made in house, and this one did not disappoint. The cake was fried, which was obviously delicious, but the addition of the tart and refreshing Granny Smith apple cubes and pomegranate reduced the heaviness of the fried cake. The Morroccan spiced ice cream was quite unique, and it paired really well with the cake. \n\nOverall, Bar Sybanne lived up to the hype, and we definitely plan on returning at some point to try out their other menu items.", 4], ["I had a really great experience here at Bar Sybanne with the chance to try some really outstanding Middle Eastern/Mediterranean/Persian inspired menu. The place is bustling in the evening so make reservations when you can.\n\nWe came out to Bar Sybanne to celebrate a birthday and I had made the reservation through OpenTable. I had casually mentioned that it was for a birthday celebration and the staff presented her with a nice little birthday card. I was very impressed by the thoughtful gesture by the restaurant staff as a whole.\n\nThe service and staff at Bar Sybanne were really courteous, friendly, and attentive to our needs. They helped pace our meal adequately so that we didn't run out of room on our little table for 2.\n\nThis restaurant is family-style so come with people you like to share food and conversation with. The interior has a nice modern and comforting feel set aglow from the romantic mood lighting.\n\nFor our appetite that night, we decided on the following:\n\n1. Labneh: I liked the addition of the pomegranate nibs and the nice smooth texture of the soft cream cheese. The sweetness of the molasses didn't really come through for me. They give you some really nice crunchy carbs to spread it over.\n\n2. Ottoman Salad: Something light and crunchy to whet the appetite. The tahini dressing was light with the acidity of the citrus.  The sprinkling of chopped up dried apricots and the apple gave it a great touch of sweetness to balance out the tahini dressing.\n\n3. Steak Tartare: I can never say no to a tartare. It's like something I always want to try when I see it on the menu. Every restaurant has their own twist and take on this classic dish. It's always fun to see them bend the dish to their creative will. This one was very tasty and with a generous portion sizing. It's spiced with harissa and feta along with lemon, egg yolk, and EVOO. The meat was finely chopped up but not overdone like it was ground beef. Harissa gave each bite a little burst of heat.\n\n4. Fried Chicken: little tender crispy morsels of chicken tossed with honey and  a ripe citrus sauce. It was really fragrant and the meat was super juicy. \n\n5. Saffron Rice: we paired the tender crispy chicken with this super large heaping of saffron rice. I've never really had saffron before so this was a  first time experience for me. I really liked the chopped up dried apricots, sultanas, and pistachios that lifted the rice dish with additional textures and flavours. It was a good dish to compliment the chicken bites and will fill out any outstanding space in your tummy thereafter.\n\n6. Apple Cake: no birthday celebration is complete without dessert. This came with a little candle on top and a card from the Bar Sybanne staff. Colour me impressed. The dessert was a nice cap-off to the night. It wasn't overly sweet and the Moroccan spiced ice cream was great.\n\nOverall, a great experience here at Bar Sybanne for all occasions.", 4], ["WHAT TO TRY??!\n\nThe fried chicken, the eggplant dip, the saffron rice, the steak tartare, the fish of the day and the apple cake!\n\nThe fried chicken was crunchy with some sweetness, perhaps from honey but it was interesting. Comes in bite sizes but I have to warn you, the portion sizes run on the small side because this restaurant is tapas style so you might want to order another order if your party size is big. \n\nThe eggplant dip is also delish. Served with gozleme which is a Turkish flatbread. Additional gozlemes cost $3 so don't think it's bread and it's free for all! \n\nThe steak tartare was amazing too. Served with crunchy gozleme, the steak tartare tasted fresh and very flavourful. Lots of good ingredients mixed in there I bet in order to really draw out the flavors of the steak bits! \n\nThe fish of the day is different every time. We were served a seabream with textures similar to a sea bass. Very simple grilled fish, but it's nicely complemented with Romesco sauce, salt and lemon on the side. Romesco sauce has a tomato base which is very flavourful. \n\nThe saffron rice was very pretty with color and different ingredients. Definitely had a lot of saffron in the dish. The only feedback is the rice was a bit over cooked and there were clumps of rice in the dish. \n\nFor dessert, we got all three! I personally liked the apple cake the most because it's the most unique dessert at the restaurant. It also is their most popular one too! It's a Moroccan spiced cake with spiced ice cream on top. The cake was spicy! Now isn't that different? It's interesting, you should try it to see if you like it! \n\nAll plates are meant to be shared because of the tapas nature of the dishes. The plates are unique too with lots of different designs. Decor of the restaurant is cute and cozy. If you're wondering, the name Sybanne actually comes from combining the chef's two grandmother names together - Sybal and Anne hence Sybanne. You can also find their portraits on the wall. They were the inspirations for the chefs dishes.\n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nMake reservations because this restaurant isn't too big and it gets really busy around dinner time! They've only been open for three months so it's still a relatively new restaurant in the Ossington strip! The best seat in the house is definitely at the back with the coaches and cushions. Your party has to be five people though! There's two such seatings in the back so when you make your reservations, you can request for those seats!", 4], ["Flavours are unbelievable. Everything we ordered was amazing - but don't forget about the mushrooms or chicken bites.\n\nWait staff go above and beyond - and the owner is a very passionate and friendly fellow, makes it a point to say hello and chat with the customers. Top-notch service. Definitely returning.", 5], ["Toronto has some crazy good middle eastern restaurants, while this may not fall atop of that list of me, it's still a very solid dining experience. The food was good, not the best I've had in terms of middle eastern, but I'm going to chalk that up to me having high expectations. \nWhat really elevated this experience was the staff, overall deco/ambiance of the place and their good cocktails!\n\nA big reason for my so-so feeling about the food was that I ordered the labneh which I didn't love, maybe not what I was in the mood for, would have been wiser to go with the hummus. And the cauliflower app (priced as \"market price\" which was a first for me for cauliflower) also was not as enjoyable as other cauliflower dishes I've had at middle eastern places. Not to say that both these dishes weren't good, they certainly were but just left me wanting a little. \n\nEverything else was enjoyable and no complaints, but nothing mind blowing, and I'm perfectly fine having good food without having my mind blown :) \n\nI would come back here and give them another shot but not anytime soon.

Be careful not to touch the bowl! It might burn you. The beef short ribs were succulent and very flavorful! My first time having Korean food and it now won't be my last!

The kimchi tasted more spicy than others that I've had before.\n\nWe sat for 15 minutes before being offered any water. Then our first dish came and we had no dishes to eat our food in. The beef short rib sampler was delicious. The beef was my favorite. It wasn't chewy and was marinated with a nice sweet sauce. The mixed meat and seafood soft tofu was very bland. There was no flavouring to the broth nor the contents. The seafood pancake had good flavouring but there was not a lot of seafood in it. It was very thin compared to other seafood pancakes I've had for the same cost. The sauce it came with was a nice sweet mildly spicy sauce. \n\n4/5 for the food but the service had a lot to be desired. All in all 2.5/5 for the whole experience.

I didn't realize how much vegetables were incorporated into traditional Korean rice bowls and soups/stews! Delicious! We ordered their MUSHROOM BEEF BIMBIMBAP and their PORK & SOFT TOFU (spicy!!) STEW. Both were super warming in the belly, had tons of textures and flavours that were well-balanced from the savoury meat pieces, to the refreshing bites of cooked vegetables. Only thing to critique really was the side of rice was mushy and the miso soup was quite salty.\n\n//Overall//\nVery reasonably priced at $10-$15 per dish with good portions and lots of fresh and delicious meats & vegetables. The servers were also very polite and the place was kept clean & tidy!", 5], ["Great Korean Food\nWe tried the Mushroom Bimbimbap & bubbling hot Kimchi & Beef Rice dish, both were delicious. I definitely preferred the Bimbimbap, it came in a hot stone bowl, full of flavour, and lots of yummy stuff. My BF & I shared the little apps they bring you and Had leftovers. $35 for two dishes and a beer.", 4], ["I'm a fan of this place.  Partially because how easy it is to get for us but i like the small space and friendly atmosphere and yes the menu too.\n\nPork bone soup is okay but i loe that they have soon tofu and non spicy options where some Korean places dont offer that.\n\nMenu is not the typical encyclopedia style variety that you might get with other traditional places but again, I kinda liek that the menu is a little more focused.\n\nEven though there isnt dedicated parking, we've never had any issue finding parking on the sidestreets and various times and days of the week.\n\nMenu does change seasonally we have found", 4], ["This is a really nice home style Korean Restaurant in a convenient location off the highway. \nFrom first to last impressions, loved the place.\nThere was a lot of variety on the menu and the servers were super friendly. They let us take our time and ensured that we felt comfortable there. The place wasn't busy at all when we came, which made me a little sad because it really should be.\nWe had their kalbi as an appetizer, my boyfriend got the pork bone soup and I got the sizzling hot bulgogi.\nThe kalbi was to die for. Perfectly cooked and had a nice grill taste without an overpowering sauce on it.\nMy boyfriend said that the pork bone soup was really good and it looked like it had a lot of meat in it!\nThe bulgogi was pretty good and had a lot of veggies on it, which I love! The initial taste threw me off, but not in a bad way at all!\nOverall, there was a lot of parking in the back and the food was great, so I'd highly recommend to try this place!", 5], ["Came in summer. Oyster Katsu + Cold Noodles. Very 'q' buckwheat noodles. Good prompt service. HITS: cold noodles (comes with the vinegar and hot mustard ). Nice banchan. Solid home styled local Korean restaurant. Looking forward to coming back to try the rest of the menu!", 4], ["Authentic Korean. Great pork bone soup. I went off menu and asked if they could make some kimchi bokum bap and they really came through. Tasted just like I was back in hayang South Korea getting a snack in an alleyway cafe cooked by an ajuma. \n\nI would rate this place on par and possibly ahead of cho sun ok. Real side dishes made with love and care. \n\nClean, bright ambience. Friendly, efficient and accommodating staff. I have been twice and will be back. Highly recommended for Korean food lovers and better than most restaurants in bloor/Christie or young/finch neighbourhoods\n\n\nWas back again yesterday with The Lade (lady). This place has found a way to get even better! Kimchi jigae was delicious and hot on a cold day. The lade ordered yukgaejang and loved those beef and noodle-full-spoonfuls oh yeah. The seafood Korean pancake is now a must order for us on every visit. Phenomenal!!", 5], ["We had stumbled on this place when feeling like asian food.  The hosts were very friendly from the get go and seated us right away. Since we were new they took the time to explain the menu to us and suggested a few favorites including which ones were spicy or not.  They also brought along water as we perused the menu.\n\nWe selected the bulgogi beef with glass noodles, fried chicken udon, kalbi beef appetizer, kimchi soup and pork bone soup.  As soon as we ordered they sent along small trayed snacks for us like chilled beansprouts, flavoured tofu, homemade kimchi (really good!), pickled vegetables.\n\nWhen our food arrived we ended up sharing everything.  Everything was very tasty!  The soup noodles come with purple rice as well so absolutely filling.\n\nEverything was pretty great and we'll definitely be back!", 5], ["It's been ages since I've had home style Korean food. Chaban maybe a little place but it comes with big flavours.  I loved how there seemed to be an entire family running the place and making you feel right at home at their kitchen table.\n\nThis is not some modern vibe or hip place on Ossington.  It's an honest spot with handcrafted dishes.  The place is sparse but clean.  There's two rooms ... one in the back is smaller and more private and the larger front space with a number of big tables and tables for 4.  It's well spaced out so you're never feeling claustrophobic.  There's no noticeable loud music so it's a pretty calming place.  If there is a loud table, you're going to hear them... you're never really far from them.  I wouldn't necessarily call this place as much as spartan.  There's no discernible decorations but a clean bright space is always appreciated.\n\nI did like how when I first walked in, you smelled the beef cooking and the smells of the Korean pork dumplings.  It's such a great smell.  I also saw at least 3 'Aunties' sitting at the table and just folding the dumplings.  If this isn't a sign of great food to come, I dont know what it would be.  \n\nService here is quick, attentive, and considerate.  Within minutes after seating, we had someone check our table and whenever we need them, all it took was an eye glance and they walked over.  I wish this was normal in all restaurants.  \n\nAlso, there is free parking behind the restaurant but WARNING, it is an utter fustercluck.  I was waiting for 2 moving vans who slowly snailed their way backwards into the street traffic and block both ways.  More than once.  It was terrible as it was hilarious. \n\nBan Chan - with most Korean dinners, you are given several side plates to enjoy.  We were given 4 in total .. spicy savage kimchi, matchsticks potato, sesame bean sprouts, and a daikon seas weed salad.  The Kimchi was the most vibrant and flavourful ... 4/5 for that. Everytjing else is 3.5/5\n\nSeafood Pancake - A generous 'pancake' with lots of flavour green onion, calamari, shrimp, and some clams.  There is a lot of crisp edges to enjoy and a spicy dipping sauce for you to burn your tongue on 4/5\n\nBulgogi on a sizzling plate - Enjoyable thinly cut beef arrived popping and sizzling on the hot plate.  It had a decent flavour and was tender.  4:5\n\nSoon Tofu soup with seafood - It came in the heated bowl and it was just bubbling away for a while as it cooked in front of me.  The freshly cracked egg made it a richer stew and there was a lot of soft tofu and calamari.  This definitely was medium spiced.  I loved it but I wouldn't recommend it to a new person trying! 4/5\n\nBibimbap with seafood - comfort food at its finest with a lot of finely diced vegetables to mix in with the rice, seafood, and hot sauce.  I think there could have been a bit more seafood but it was a nice dish 3.5/5\n\nI do understand it's more expensive than the ones on Bloor but for those who live far from Toronto, Chaban is a great alternative.", 4], ["Since my first 2017 review, in which I gave 5 stars, Chaban continues to impress, and is our family's go-to Korean restaurant.\nThe food is consistently excellent. For example, my favourites, which are the Tofu Dregs stew and the Kimchi pancake, are always great. So is their Banchan, those little side dishes that show up at the start of your meal. The Banchan vary according to season, and Chaban's are always beautifully calibrated to suit the weather. So if it is hot and humid outside, like it was tonight, then you get cooling, refreshing bachan. Nice, right!\nMy son raves about the spicy chicken at Chaban. In fact, we have tried several times to replicate the dish at home, but nothing is as good, for him, as the original Chaban.\nMy mother loves the House Bibimbap because it is tasty as well as very healthly. The mushrooms and fungi alone have multiple health benefits, according to my Mother. On our last visit, one of our guests, who is a Weight Watcher's client, enthusiastically ordered and ate the House Bibimbap, and had an apparently guilt-free meal. Tucked away in an intersection near Queensway and Royal York Road, Chaban is a beautiful, family run establishment with somewhat difficult parking, but I have always been able to find a spot, even if I had to resort to street parking. The hand-drawn chalkboard menus are charming, and the artistry of the family is apparent in the time and crafting involved with drawing up the chalkboard menus alone. More importantly, the food is great!!\nIt is really worth the drive to Etobicoke!\nOh, and I didn't mention the excellent LA Galbi beef short ribs.\nYou really should give Chaban a try, if you enjoy Korean food.", 5], ["Parking is usually full in the back. Food is good. Have gone here a few times but generally do take out. They're not cheap, but portions are good and can last for 1.5-2 meals which makes it worth it.", 4], ["My family and I were craving Korean food and this was one of the few places that was opened on Easter Sunday. The place is a good size for a family-run restaurant. The decoration was okay, modern and clean. We were seated immediately when we got there. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of stuff to share amongst the 4 of us: Chaban Dolsot Bibimbap ($11.99), Seafood pancake ($14.99), Pork Bone Soup ($8.99), Bean Curd Dreg Stew ($10.99), LA Kalbi ($18.99). \n\nThe chaban Dolsot bibimbap was highly recommended by yelpers and it sure was the best dish of the night! There was quite alot of \"filling\" or meats/veggies and an egg in the dish. The rice at the bottom was crispy, which is my favourite part of the dish. \n\nThe Pork Bone Soup was very disappointing. This is my dad's favourite dish and he was quite excited to eat it when it was served to him boiling. However, as he took a few bites, he complained that it was COLD on the INSIDE. We all took a few bites and we thought the same. The soup might look boiling on the outside, but it is obvious they just reheated the meat and didn't boil it long enough. We called one of the waiters over and told him our concern, but he didn't really know how to deal with it. In fact, he looked scared that he might need to give this dish for us for free. He just stood there for a few seconds didn't know what to do or say (no, there wasn't a language barrier as he could speak English very fluently). So we suggested that he reboils the PBS. He gladly agreed to do so. \n\nThe seafood pancake was also very good! It was eggy and fluffy, just the way my family likes it. There was a good amount of seafood in it. I liked how it wasn't oily at all. \n\nThis restaurant was one of the few restaurants that served my favourite Bean Curd Dreg Stew. It is basically grounded up tofu stew with meat and kimchi. As expected, it came boiling (literally bubbling everywhere). I've had this stew many times in Korea, but this one tasted very weird to me. I am not sure what it was, perhaps the tofu? The taste was off. \n\nMy mom ordered the LA kalbi because she saw another table order it and it looked delicious. It wasn't anything special; it was pricey and it was quite salty to me. \n\nTHE PROBLEM:  \nSeveral hours after the meal, my dad started having abdominal pain, diarrhea, and all sorts of food poisoning symptoms. Then, a little while later, both my mom and brother experienced the same thing as well. We were trying to figure out which dish had the problem and we concluded that the PBS might be problem because they all had the most and I only had a spoonful. Not sure if it was because they didn't boil it enough in the first run or it was just NOT MADE FROM SCRATCH and JUST REHEATED IT, but it scared us a lot. \n\nBecause of our food poisoning experience, we will definitely NOT return. Also, Overall, everything here was $1-2 more than other Korean restaurants and other places had better quality of food and service.", 2], ["It was our last day in Toronto, and we stopped by Chaban for a late lunch before heading to the airport to fly home. There is some parking in the back of the restaurant, but since it was full, we parked along the residential street a couple of blocks away. We ended up ordering:\n\nBibimbap: this was good (served in a stone pot, with soup on the side)\n\nSeafood tofu soup: spicy seafood soup with tofu is always satisfying\n\nKalbi short ribs: I got the appetizer portion, and it was nice and juicy\n\nOverall, we liked the food. It was quick and no nonsense, which is what you want to have for lunch.", 3], ["So happy to have a good korean restaurant on the queensway! Every time we drive by the queensway you see the windows at this restaurant fogged up and filled with lots of people. Came in on a week night and still had to wait about 10 minutes for an open seat. The restaurant has a very homey feel, A mom and dad is in the kitchen and their kids (I'm assuming) are out front serving and at the cash. They have a pretty extensive menu with the classic korean items.\n\nWe tried the bulgogi sizzling plate, the fried chicken katsu and also the classic pork bone stew. The pork bone stew was flavourful, spicy and homey tasting. The bulgogi portion was bigger than i imagined it to be, it also came with alot of different veggies (Zucchini, onions and carrots) it was also very flavourful and hubby quite enjoyed how piping hot it came out. The chicken katsu was crispy and tasty as well but it's not a must get from here. Side dishes at korean restaurants are also my fav and the ones here did not disappoint. The kim chi here has the right amount of spice and saltiness and leaves you wanting more and more refills!\n\nA bonus is that justeat actually delivers chaban if you're within the area but we never tried... contemplating how that will taste especially if you were to order a stew. Nevertheless, will be returning again, especially on a cold day for some homey korean food!", 4], ["A true hidden gem. Came here after a long day of work outside in the cold. The restaurant is located on the Queensway with a parking behind the restaurant. Came her on a Thursday night at 6 pm and there was no one in the restaurant.

It wasn't spicy at all and didn't have a strong kimchi flavour to it. BUT the dumpling soup was amazing; it hit the spot for a cold day. The broth was light and the mandu was so good! Best mandu soup I've ever had. Definitely will be coming back.", 4], ["I'd been eyeing this place since it opened and never had the opportunity to go in, or when I was looking for something to eat I forgot all about it - that won't happen anymore, I can guarantee that.\n\nLooking for a lunch that satisfies both the omnivore and a vegetarian/vegan taste, look no further as Chaban has made many parts of their menu fresh and totally flexible to suit all needs and tastes. As others mentioned, this place is well lit, clean and extremely authentically Korean. The one issue can be parking as the lot around back is small, so you may need to resort to street parking.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Korean cuisine and this is your first time, you really cannot go wrong with a few staple items, Kalbi (galbi), bibimbap (rice topped with fresh veggies and meats or tofu served in a blazing hot stone bowl), Chicken Katsu and Gamjatang (pork bone soup).\n\nOn this first visit, a lunch, I should have just gone for one of the above but it had been so long since I had had good Korean food that I ended up ordering far too much. I went with a Pork Bone Soup to start - which was sizeable (a meal in and of itself), followed by the Mushroom Bibimbap bowl.\n\nFood came out basically all at once so I looked like a bit of a glutton, but I'm fine with that. To begin, the pork bone soup was outstanding! The pork was incredibly fall off the bone tender and had a great taste to it and not super fatty either, while the broth was extremely clean, jam packed with flavour (and even more jam packed with spice - I choked on the spice more than once).\n\nFollowing the PBS I worked on my Bibimpab. It wasn't the hottest bowl I've ever had as it really wasn't sizzling all that much as I've come to expect, so the rice didn't crisp as it should. That aside it was still crazy hot and did the trick enough to be more than enjoyable. All the ingredients were incredibly fresh, so much so you could smell the freshness. The meat was equally delicious and all together the dish was just fantastic.\n\nMy one observation about stuffing yourself at a place like this is, yes, you feel full, but it's not a gross full feeling like when you eat greasy or unhealthy foods. It's an extremely content full that you're body is able to deal with easily and quickly.\n\nI'm glad a high quality + healthy place like this opened close to home for me as I can safely say this winter it will be my go to for healthy and tasty lunches.\n\nEatcrest Out", 4], ["We recently came across this little family run place on yelp and went by for dinner. \n\nNot much to be said other that it was quite delicious and the service was excellent.

Great variety, good portions, reasonably priced. Menu is condensed enough that it listed out on 1 page that serves as a placemat. It has the typical Korean restaurant fare, but I liked some of the few extra things they add just to make it a bit different.\n\nIf you are looking for a starter, I recommend the kimchi pancake. The crunchy texture was really addictive and had me craving more even when I was full. Some places tend to over-do the starchiness of the pancake, but not here!\n\nI ordered the Mushroom Dolsot Bibimbap as my main, which I would reorder again if I was craving a vegetarian option. The rice was perfectly crunchy, had a large portion of vegetables than I expected to rice, and the sauce is flavorful but not overwhelming. \n\nGamjatang (pork bone soup) here hits the spot on the cold day. Compared to other Korean restaurants, the pork bones were rather generous and meaty as well as not being too greasy. \n\nOrdered the pan-fried noodles with beef (essentially bulgogi with vegetables on stir fried udon) and I liked the flavor. Overall, I'm inclined to think there aren't any \"bad\" dishes on the menu. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small, so it can get quite busy depending on the time you go and parking is very, very limited (better off parking across the street if you had there for dinner).", 4], ["Much like the other reviews, the overall food and atmosphere had a very \"home-ly\" and family vibe.

I like Korean food and have been to many Korean restaurants. The food at Chaban is bland and lacks of seasonings. The pork bone soup lacks flavour and it needs to be cooked longer.

The bibimbap was great and so were the complimentary side dishes, Prices were fair as well. Similar to Korean restaurants in downtown Chinatown. On the downside, the portions were on the smaller side so you may need an appetizer to be full.  I was still kind of hungry after my meal and I usually don't eat a lot compared to other people.

And they don't serve the little dishes until your main dish arrives (which isn't the case in other Korean restaurants?), so I couldn't even nibble on snacks while I was waiting.  They were clearly understaffed, because the 3 servers that were working were running around like crazy, trying to deal with kitchen orders, a million take out orders and dine ins.  They were very friendly however and apologized for the wait.  Food was okay - my tofu stew was very bland, and barely had any seafood in it.

It can be made vegan upon request. It is also suitable for people with dietary restrictions that require soft food. This is another lovely flavorful dish, where the drizzled molasses provides a nice contrast to the stew.\n\nThe only disappointment was the Kabob Barg, which was tender, but dry and flavorless.\n\nHighly recommend the Dizi!", 4], ["I never had proper Iranian food until I got the opportunity to come to Sheherzade and was absolutely thrilled!

First you have a lamb broth, with which you are meant to drink and dip bread into.\n\nThen you have what is essentially a mortar and pestle. You use this to bash tender pieces of lamb, white beans, chickpeas, potato, tomato, etc into a paste and eat it with bread. It is DELICIOUS and fun.\n\nThe Dizi itself gets this to 4 stars. You must love lamb. Otherwise this is 3 stars. I love Pomegranate and will go there from now on.\n\nOK: \nKabob-e Torsh - Chunks of veal with walnut and pomegranate sauce. The veal was overcooked.

I was only wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and I was still sweating a lot.\n\nPortions are huge.\n\nService was friendly, but our food took an incredibly long time to arrive.

The food was very authentic & good quality (according to my Persian friends). The service was quite friendly too.  \nTip#1: Add a bit (or a lot!) of Sumac seasoning (dark red powder in the shaker bottle) onto your kebob meat. It has an almost sour fruity taste which really balances out and adds an unique edge to the meaty kabobs. \nTip#2: You'll get small packets of butter that you're supposed to mix & melt into your rice.\n\n//APPETIZERS//\nWe tried their Maast-e Saadeh (yogurt dip) with Persian flatbread, Zeitoon Parvardeh (olives), and the Kal Kabob (eggplant with ground walnut & pomergranate) which was my favourite and quite sour.\n\n//ENTREES//\nI tried the Kubideh and Jujeh (Chicken Breast) Kabob, which were both delicious and juicy. The Kabob-e-Torsh veal sirloin meat was too tough, while the the pomegranate walnut molasses was interesting to try, know that it's quite sour too! I also substituted the rice for the salad which was too overdressed with vinaigrette.\n\n//DESSERT//\nMy ABSOLUTE favourite thing we had was the Saffron Rosewater Ice Cream.

Their prices are somewhat on the higher end in comparison to Persian restaurants in Richmond Hill, but then again, rent is more expensive on College St, so I get it.\n\nI was disappointed to find out that because this place only serves Halal meat according to Islamic tradition, they can't cook any meat that's medium rare. It can only be medium at best or well done, so as to avoid blood. Why? Because consumption of blood is prohibited in Islam. It's frustrating when religious beliefs dictate one's behaviour and restaurant policies to the detriment of customer preferences. I should point out that this interpretation from the Qur'an is misconstrued according to my research. The consumption of blood specifically on its own is forbidden, but the residue of blood on meats that are consumed is not forbidden. As long as the meat is Halal the chef should be able to serve medium rare meat upon request of a customer. I believe the management of the restaurant should revise their policy in relation to cooking meat medium rare or even rare as there is no basis in their own religious text for their insistence on cooking meat well done or medium.\n\nSuffice it to say, I moderaetly enjoyed the lamb chops I ordered, because parts of them were well done and there's nothing more unenjoyable than eating meat that's well done. It's wasn't as juicy and tender as I'm used to.\n\nWould I be back? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

The Red Vine signature pizza is also a favorite, as it resembles the classic margherita pizza. \n\nThe pizza itself was decent for a fast food place to fulfill your appetite.

I liked the fact that even though I ordered a signature pizza my pizza maker was thoughtful enough to ask if I wanted the signature pizza as is or to add or subtract anything from it. They cook it right in front of you and it doesn't take too long. Before you know it your pizza is cooked perfectly and you have the option to add sauce for no extra charge. I decided on ranch sauce and hot sauce which ended up giving the pizza the perfect amount of kick.

The pizza making line is often slowed by attempting to accommodate the orders of in-store customers while simultaneously managing takeout and delivery currier orders.

One of the flavours is like a virgin mojito. \nService is fast & friendly-explaining how the menu worked. Each client who walks through the door is greeted and acknowledged. I like that!  \nLocation -right smack in the middle of dundas square- touristy location. \nPrice point at 10.95 a pie, for a personal sized pizza is fair.  \nRecommendations for other nearby places (by the slice) - Pizzaiolo at Yonge & Adelaide.

The mozzarella and fresh basil were impeccable. \n\nThe customer service was great too. I usually don't expect too much from fast casual places, but the staff came up to us several times to make sure we were happy with the food and to clear our table once we were done. \n\nThe size is perfect to share between two people and I think the price is right for the quality, considering it is in a busy downtown location. \n\nHuge fan!", 5], ["[fire emoji] [fire emoji] [fire emoji]\n\nLet's just be honest, let's just be real.

The pizza is reasonably well priced and is ready to eat in minutes. \n\nI had the red vine pizza because it seems like the best item to test the core product, that is, the crust and sauce. I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised - the crust is more towards the crispier side than spongy (I prefer greasy and spongy but this is a healthy product), it certainly tastes good, and there wasn't an overbearing aftertaste. The tomato sauce actually tastes like tomatoes and doesn't have that metallic flavour that some other places might have. \n\nThe other thing about this place is that their attitude towards health - ingredients seem wholesome (ex. they highlight their gluten-free crust) and calories are listed (not terrible amounts considering it's pizza).I saw a lot of runners stop by for a quick bite to go. \n\nAll in all, a great experience and I will be coming back to try the unlimited toppings next time! \n\nSide note: s'more sandwiches were eh.", 4], ["Dakota Tavern has the look and feel of a hundred year old Toronto bar that has rock n roll coursing thru its veins.

Sure, you can't see anything with people standing in front and no raised stage, but it sounds great in there. The bathrooms are right beside the bar, which makes sense if you think about Jim Morrison drinking beer in the bathroom saving a lot of time wandering back and forth. \nI met up with friends here for an early show, which was around 7 pm, yeah that's early! But when you see how few people can actually enjoy a show, the double bill just made sense. Beer was easy to buy at the bar, without any problem getting the barkeep's attention as they can seem to read minds there which is fantastic when loud music is playing. Even though I forgot my earplugs that night, which was a Canadian Tribute to Tom Petty, the sound was not an assault.

What's with all these brunch places not accepting reservations??\n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were slapped in the face with the country vibe: rustic wooden tables, exposed brick, fake barn door, everyone in jeans and plaid, etc. It was super cute! There were a lot of family already there and children were running around having a good time. Bluegrass music was playing in the background, but not obnoxiously loud. A live band started playing at noon, and they were really good and complimented the chill atmosphere.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by our waitress who was extremely nice and explained to us how the ordering worked. For $18, you get an all-you-can-eat family styled brunch and unlimited coffee/tea. One round would be served for the table, which everyone shared, and you can keep on ordering additional rounds until you're full. The food consisted of pancakes, scrambled eggs, potatoes, breakfast sausages and an assortment of fruit. For an additional $5/plate, you can get extra sides like bacon or baked beans. We thought that was pretty steep and decided to opt out on the sides. None of the dishes were particularly fancy, but were very hearty. My group made it through two rounds before calling quits.\n\nOverall, I wasn't particularly wowed by the quality of the food (it truly felt like something your family could cook up at home), but for the atmosphere and live entertainment, it was well worth the $18.

I like the vibe of the place, and the location and its average prices. However, if you have 150 people coming to a space for a show, there should be some sitting space. It was soooo uncomfortable standing around, barely able to see, trying not to hit people. There were tables and chairs, which was lovely for the 50 people sitting, but the rest of us were really struggling. Other than that, I loved it, but that was a serious problem that seemed so easily fixable, and I would like to not feel totally cramped for 2 hours while watching a show, sitting or standing.\n\nAs for the bluegrass brunch, I went on a Saturday morning. It was all you can eat, which was nice, because I stuffed myself, but the actual food is pretty mediocre. It's scrambled eggs, sausages and fruit and pancakes.

Some other dishes that were pretty good were the Parmesan chicken and the fried bananas!\n\nPro tip to try it all if you've never been, every time they come around, ask for small slivers of each to try. Don't feel the need to finish each portion right away as you can slowly scope out which ones you like best and reorder more of that at the end!\n\nThe ambiance was also super cute because every so often they had a show with girls in full costume dancing and guys playing the drums.

We just didn't like how all of them were cooked rare, like I had blood on all my plates which is not a nice view. However, one of the meat carvers was very understanding and even cooked the meat we asked for well done. For the buffet, it was mediocre. The lasagne was actually disgusting, cold (although it was in one of those warmers), dry and just overall very bland in taste. I did enjoy the rice with black beans and the fruit spinach salad (I went back up twice for this). \n\nAs for our waitress, she was very sweet and friendly but all I can say is that common sense isn't so common anymore. I had come in the restaurant a couple hours prior to my reservation as I wanted to surprise the birthday boy with a special cake I had ordered. I explained to the hostess that it was a surprise and so we would be ready for the cake after we were done eating our meals. So our waitress now, comes up to my table after we're done eating and asks us if we're ready for the cake to be brought out. I mean commonsense would tell me to not ruin the surprise, so I wasn't very thrilled about that. Other than that she was very sweet but just for future reference, if the cake is supposed to be a surprise, don't announce it to the birthday boy.  We also had plates break right beside our table 2 separate times so I guess we weren't seated in the best spot. \n\nTo drink I got the Brazilian sangria which was actually very delicious so I would totally try that again.\n\nOverall, I had an OK time here and wouldn't be opposed to coming back but I'd probably try the Adelaide location which is apparently much nicer.", 3], ["The meat was good but the salad bar was not good to me.

Totally unnecessary and ruins perfectly good meat. \n- As a final note, I was violently ill as were two of the friends I went with after my most recent trip there despite not having eaten much for all the waiting we did. \n\nBrazilian restaurants are great in general, but if you're looking for a good quality meal in a nice and welcoming atmosphere then I would recommend looking elsewhere.", 1], ["This place is an interesting conundrum.

There are cards that you are given to indicate if you still want to be served or not - which is largely ignored by staff anyways. There is a buffet as well, however the items there were not labeled, leaving us guessing, and some of the dishes has pieces of dirt still on them.

I just think that when a place sells itself as a dining \"experience,\" it should be one. And a true dining experience is found (or lost) in the details.\n\nI've been second-guessing my first impression of Copacabana since my maiden voyage to the Mecca of Meat two weeks ago. I was excited about gauchos carrying swords stacked with meat, carving it to my little heart's content.  I was intrigued by the meat offerings I read about online. And I liked the idea of an appetizing side-dish bar to start it all off.\n\nRestaurant:\n\nA fellow Yelper has done a wonderful job describing the concept, so I'll summarize. It's an all-you-can eat BBQ and steakhouse with table service and a wide selection of meats. \n\nWe arrived (two of us) at 8:30 on a Tuesday. The band was still playing, the meat was still flying and the cozy-looking front patio was still full. We opted for indoor seating and wound up near the back of an expansive seating area with an intimate feel for its size.\n\nWe asked for a table next to the one we were shown; it hadn't been cleaned but was a little more tucked away (we were on a first date and looking for a cozy spot). Our hostess noted the new table's condition and had our server provide a wipedown. It turns out that watching a server make a table look clean is a lot like watching sausage be made - best you don't know how it's done. The top got a wipe; the underside then started to drip the remnants of a variety of animals and cocktails onto the floor below us. I asked the server to give the underside a wipe as well, but she appeared confused. Hand gestures helped and the underside was ultimately cleaned. This helped me to understand why the floor was so slippery - over the course of a night it must see the grease of a thousand meats. A mid-shift mopping would have done wonders here.\n\nSide dishes:\n\nI was a Copacabana virgin; my companion had been before and knew the routine. We started with a trip to the \"Harvest Table,\" a spread of side dishes that were sufficiently exotic to satisfy the adventurous (shrimp with baby corn?) but also had some standard fare for the mashed potatoes type (although I don't recall actually seeing mashed potatoes). There were pastas sitting out in the frying pans they had been cooked in; while this was a neat presentation, it seemed that they had sat there a while. I indulged nonetheless, aware that I often eat my own cooking an hour later. I failed to heed the advice of my companion (\"go easy on the sides and save room for meat!\") and wound up eating a somewhat-dry salmon in cream sauce out of guilt more than anything else.  All said the sides were decent but not exciting.\n\nMeat!\n\nCopacabana works on a red-card / green-card system - turn your card to green, I was told by the website, and the carvers would know to stop by with their meat offerings (flip it to red, and you'll be left alone). This sounded fun but the cards were kitschy, like something you'd see at Boston Pizza rather than a traditional churrascuria.  I also soon realized that the gauchos (carvers) would stop by with meat no matter which side of the card was showing (making it difficult to have an intimate conversation on a first date). I think the two issues were related - neither side of the card was clearly red or green, and instead read \"heat it up\" on one side and \"cool it down\" on the other (I may be paraphrasing). I suspect the carvers couldn't read the card until they showed up next to our table with a loaded skewer. On the plus side, we never had to wait long. The gauchos were friendly and skilled but seemed a bit rushed.\n\nThe meat was delicious. Two weeks after my visit I still recall many of the items I had. The house steak was memorable; the bacon-wrapped turkey and parmesan-crusted steak were great too. The Moroccan chicken was too spicy for my companion; I thought it was fabulous (a nice, slow burn). Still, I found significant variation from what's listed on the website. I was looking forward to a slow-roasted leg of lamb, and instead got lamb chops. I also don't recall tasting the parmesan-crusted pork loin that had inspired so much drooling before my visit. I ate a lot of meat that night, and found little to object to in its quality, especially considering the volumes they must do.\n\nOverall:\n\nWe enjoyed a good meal, but the \"experience\" wasn't all it could have been. Here's what would take Copacabana to 4 or 5 stars:\n\n- Cleaner tables and floors (tops & bottoms!)\n- A red/green card that is just that. Red on one side, green on the other. And carvers who heed the \"code of the card.\"\n- A website that sets the right expectation - no promising what you're not offering.\n- A nightly meat listing on the way in the door if offerings vary.\n- Better care taken at the side-dish bar, including fresher pastas.", 3], ["I've gone here twice, most recently for my birthday. Their grilled pineapple is the best I've ever tasted. Seasoned with cinnamon sugar and grilled to perfection. Their side dishes are amazing, and their bread is so fresh.

BEWARE of this as the prices are already VERY high! I is VERY pricey and they won't reserve a place for you under 6 people, which is kinda unfair, so you have to go early to get a table and they limit you with time if they are over booked which is not fair either. Now just found out that their food is ALL HALAL. I am sorry but there is NO signage saying this anywhere, not online or on the menu. I do NOT appreciate NOT being told this as I DO NOT go to establishments that serve Halal ONLY. That is not right, I have a religion too that does NOT allow me to eat this kind of food and there is NO respect givien to others if they are not informed!", 1], ["Came here last night with a friend. It was summerlicious time in Toronto so the place was packed. I first recommend that you reserve a table. It can get quite busy so call ahead to reserve. So, the way this works is that you have a 2 hour time limit. At your table you have a steak knife and a fork. On the left side you have a pair of tongs. So where are the plates? Well, there is a salad and pasta buffet at the end of the restaurant. You get your plates from there. All of this may have seemed logical but the host who seated us mumbled the instructions. So, when you have your plate, these guys come around with meat on skewers. They use a knife to cut a sliver of meat. This is where your tongs come in... you use your tongs to grab the meat as the guy is slicing off a morsel. Obviously the meat came off in pieces and I had to keep grabbing the pieces as they were falling off. One piece was accidentally knocked into my friend's cup by the guy. Another server got upset at me cause I was not holding the meat properly as he was slicing off a piece. Actually, I could not tell if he was upset or just telling me how to grab the meat cause again the guy mumbled. What is it with this place? They all mumble. The meats were cooked nicely, but man they were all salty! All I tasted was salt. Note: if you have a high blood pressure problem avoid this place. If Brazilian cuisine is this salty I am surprised that they don't have a high blood pressure epidemic in that country! The best meat was the spicy chicken cause it was not as salty as the other meats. The pineapple was delicious. I recommend that one for sure. The meat came around frequently so you were not waiting too long in between your meats. As contrary to what I read before, they don't charge you a $1 for water. The buffet was average. The service was decent. Since it was summerlicious, it was $35 per person. I don't think I ate $35 worth of meat (i got full really quick), but if you can eat a lot of meat, then go for it.", 3], ["A small boutique coffee shop that I drop by in the morning on my way to work (if I can wake up early enough)! \nThe coffee here is really good. \nI've tried the peanut butter latte and the lucky 10.

The baristas were not particularly warm or friendly, and it took a while to order as they were chatting about something in the back.

There's a few high top tables and lower tables where you can sit for a bit to enjoy a cup of coffee.  They do use a locally roasted bean for their coffees.

They have a few sweet, a few savoury, and a few sugary ones to catch your attention.\n\nAs for the espresso based drinks, they've got some serious sugary ones that can tempt any sugar fiend... mocha with white and dark chocolate?  hazelnut mocha?

I'm sure the chefs, servers and owners are trying their best to keep the business going. I mean, OF COURSE they want the restaurant to succeed, and of course this and that, but at the end of the day, a business is a business so I apologize in advantage for this really negative review. \n\nI came here with a large group for lunch and I did not expect much, or anything at all. \n\nJust by looking at their menu, I could tell that this restaurant wasn't the greatest. I personally am not a fan of going to restaurants just to eat overpriced and oily sandwiches, burgers and paninis, especially if they're so deep fried and greasey, but Utopia won the majority vote.  \n\nAnd here were some questions I had while looking at the menu beforehand: \n1. Why do some of the entrees have the word \"dinner\" in them? Am I NOT supposed to order those items for lunch? So why is it on their lunch menu then? Or is dinner just a fancy word for addressing something as an entree, but it is already under the heading \"entree.\" In my opinion, I just think adding the word \"dinner\" to describe a dish is incredibly outdated and reminds me of frozen dinner. I mean DINNER? WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?  \n2. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPETIZERS AND STARTERS???\n3. There is a typo on the menu. Try to spot it. \n\nSo, why is the rating so low? \n\n1. As my group went around ordering, about half of the items on the menu were UNAVAILABLE and we got to the restaurant when it just opened! My group of 13 arrived around 11:35 and the restaurant OPENED at 11:30. There were so many unavailable items that it seemed TYPICAL for this restaurant to run out of x or y or z. So, why not take those items out of the menu? Why not focus on perfecting other menu items? A lot of people had to reorder beers, as a group we had to reorder the starters and appetizers (STILL don't know the difference between them. I guess \"starters\" are more for sharing?????), and no surprise, there was an item in the dessert menu that was unavailable. I understand that this is the type of restaurant to only have 2 chefs in the kitchen and maybe their food isn't that good, but it has a patio and it's cheaper than \"nicer\" restaurants and bars, and blah blah blah, but I don't know, it's just not for me. It's about money and time. There are so many bars and restaurants in Toronto, and if I can't get the food I want, then I'll just go somewhere else.  \n\n2. For the \"appetizers\" and \"starters\", we got the chicken karaage, the spanakopita and the mushroom and pesto quesadilla. I really enjoyed the spanakopita, although I did think the spinach was just a little bit under seasoned, but the quesadilla! OH MY GLOB. It just looked unappetizing and when the last quesadilla was left on the plate, no one wanted to eat it because the whole plate was drenched in oil! What the heck?? How much oil do they use and why was it so drenched? \n\n3. For my main dish, I ordered a veggie burger with avocado, crispy onions, grilled onions, onions, garlic dill mayo and the sriracha mayo. Oh my goodness, I literally just remembered that I asked for jalape\u00f1os, but they didn't give me jalape\u00f1os. But, the biggest problem was that the whole thing was SO OVERSEASONED. I could barley taste the individual ingredients because it was COVERED with salt and pepper. I could see each individual pepper and salt grains in my food!! My fries were also seasoned to such an extreme and no one else had seasoning on their fries. Inconsistency! The veggie burger itself tasted really bad too, but I couldn't really tell because the shit was so salty and peppery that I was too busy chugging water after each bite. I really think I drank more of their water than eat their food. \n\n4. Some of their portions were just way too big and I don't think this was a good thing because I saw a lot of food get sent back and inevitably, tossed. Not only would Utopia be losing money, but it is also a waste of food. I don't think it looks good when uneaten food gets returned back to the kitchen. Someone in my group ordered poutine and it was just massive AF and half eaten. A bunch of people only ate half of their sandwiches because the portions were just too big. When portions are too big, people are also less likely to eat them. \n\n5. Someone mentioned their burger was dry, someone else's panini was really burnt. Someone else got the crab cake dinner and it looked like a bunch of fries and three frozen crab cakes. Someone ordered a shrimp burrito and said the seasoning was weird. JUST UGH!!!  I'm not disappointed, because this is the exact kind of food I'd figured I'd get. \n\nSome good things about the place? \n1. The atmosphere is nice, I guess. It's really casual. \n\nTLDR; Not Utopia. If you come here, just come for the spanakopita if they so happen to have it that day.", 1], ["So disappointing. I used to go here all the time and decided it would be nice to show my out of town family a good meal. I was mistaken.

We left without eating and I was shocked at their lack of apology, it was like they didn't care at all. \n\nIt's no wonder no one goes here anymore.

To be honest if she hadn't mentioned it I wouldn't have even noticed it.  That was fine though, we were happy to sit in the front.  It's small (about 7-8 tables), but you're not stuck close together.  Once we sat down we looked and could see the back area down a hallway, it looked pretty happenin' for a Monday night.  Friendly attentive service \n\nI like the menu here because there is a really good variety of food.  We both opted for a burger and were really happy with our decision.  I had the lamb burger.  It was a bit dry for my liking, but it still tasted great and they made up for it with generous toppings.  The fries were AMAZING.  Crispy, seasoned and the dipping sauces we ordered were delicious.  Probably some of the best fries I've ever had.

We ordered online a few weeks ago, and tried to get in contact regarding our disappointing meal (Burned black nachos, packaging that turned all into a soggy mush upon arrival, poor presentation and boxes of sloppy food). Our email was kind, and just offered a delivery packaging suggestion that would potentially avoid ruining the quality of the food offered.\n\nWe received no response at all. We were not looking for a discount, refund or anything, just acknowledgement that we received a disappointing, expensive \"meal\".\n\nWe will not order online again, and have not set foot in the restaurant since (We made frequent visits in the past).\n\nOverall, the food is good, but our bad customer relations experience has turned us away from ever wanting to go back.", 1], ["Utopia is my very own make-shift paradise in which herbivores and carnivores can come together and break bread.

I love the Kissing Cousins burger. If you're a vegetarian, feel free to sub any burgers for a veggie patty free of charge. Also a must-try is their veggie poutine which is heavenly with its cheese curds and gravy. It's one of my favourite items! I'm also a fan of their Classic Rueben sandwich, grilled cheese (so cheesy!), and curried sweet potato soup. They are so generous with all their portions it's unbelievable! Friends have tried their burritos, salads, and nachos and have said good things.\n\nThe servers are friendly, but depending on how busy it gets you may have to wait a while for your food. It's understandable why there's a crowd because they offer some pretty sweet deals. They have $8 lunch specials (soup, sandwich, and side) on Mon-Thurs from 11-3 pm.

The sitting was a bit uncomfortable. Once in the we were attended right way. \n\nAll 5 of were vegetarians to begin with and they have tons of veggie options that was one of the reasons why we visited this establishment based on the reviews. Had veggie nachos to begin with. Not the best we have had but still made it to top 5. \n\nWe had three burgers on the table - Utopia, Swiss & Mushroom and Southwestern all with Poutine - an extra charge of $3 for each. There is just way too much food on plate for one to finish. So order poutine only if you think you can finish it. All the burgers were devoured. There was also a Vegetarian Souvlaki with fries and a Crispy Veggie Chicken burrito with Salad. I would say the Souvlaki and Veggie Chicken Burrito were the best with the Souvlaki a slightly better edge. Good balance of Veggie Chicken and veggies. \n\nWe also shared a creme brule. Had a nice crunch on top and a creamy custard which was not very sweet. Nice way to end the meal. \n\nThe service and wait staff were prompt and courteous. It does get cool in the back yard covered patio. They closed one of the \"windows\" after a while. They need better chairs as well. All in all a good trip from western suburb and worth the drive.

Midway through the nachos we thought we would burst, and we went in the restaurant starving. We didn't finish our meal but we did the next time by skipping the appetizer (if you could call it that). The nachos are definitely better for a party of three or four. I had the lamb and Brie burrito and I raved about it for days.

All the time, the one dish was sitting on the ledge (not heated) getting cold.  The waiter then took a phone call and that was it.

By then we were famished and went into the first place we could find - Cafe Diplomatico.  The breakfast was only so-so - but the service was fast and incredibly pleasant.

The waitstaff seem to know what they are doing and are very friendly and professional. \n\nThe food is excellent. Everything at White Lily is made in-house and made well.  From the jams, to the breads, to the smoked meat, you can taste the quality in every bite.  We tried a nubmer of sandwitches (the patty melt, the club and the pastrami) as well as a ceasar salad, a pancake and a traditional breakfast.  \n\nOf the sandwitches, my favorate was the melt. It came with a yummy relish which still triggers a salivation reflex, every time I think about it. The melt is closely followed closely by the pastrami which was impressively stacked between two slices of rye.  The club sanwitch was also excellent with the turkey being particularly juicy and flavourfull.  However, I think a little bit less turkey and perhaps another vegetable would have actually made for a better balance.\n\nThe breakfast was exactly as it should be; an excellent hashbrown (not soaked in oil as I expected it to be), fresh eggs and crispy house-smoked bacon. \n\nThe pancake was also well preapred.  It had that perfect airy flavour and  a distnic \"home-made\" feel about it.  It is a little bit smaller than you would expect but we over-ordered in terms of the overall number of dishes, so the portion actually worked out. \n\nWhite Lily also makes donuts (because of course they do!).

My favourites were the grits and the biscuit. I never ate grits before this meal. For all the Asians out there wondering what grits tastes like, it's pretty much like a thick congee. Haha. The biscuit was full of fluffy, buttery goodness. The fermented greens looked suspiciously like bok choy. No regrets ordering this dish. Absolutely loved it!\n\nButtermilk griddle cakes: nice, thick pancakes. Not the fluffy type of pancake, but still very delicious. \n\nHashbrown: thinly grated into fine strands, but served as one big hashbrown. Incredibly crisp!

The buttermilk, aged ricotta and bacon bits helped cover up some of the bitterness though.\n\nOverall, a great meal. There was a small mixup with our orders, but service was still super friendly.

So we hurried over to be seated at the bar (which we had previously okay'd). \n\nThe menu looked pretty simple but looking at the dishes around us, they've perfected their dishes. We asked for the Standard White Lily breakfast and the Southern. The man loved the grits and we were both impressed with the perfectly poached eggs...runny just the way we love em. We're guessing they use organic eggs based on the dark orange yolks. The sausage was a little dry but only because it was shoved full of fat...and the bacon was a good dose of meat and not just fattiness. Quality ingredients...hurray!

Had the white Lily standard (choose the sausage, very delicious) scrambled eggs (loved the technique the way they make it). The hash was amazing, I asked for sour cream on the side which made it perfect! I don't normally drink coffee, it was strong but quite good. I was wired after being into my second cup.

It's also worth mentioning that my partner (who ordered the same thing) always asks for his eggs over-medium which a lot of places don't get right -- the eggs were cooked perfectly. We also got an order of house fermented pickles -- if you're a pickle freak like me, definitely worth trying.\n\nService was friendly and attentive. The interior has a cozy diner feel.

With a white base, they replaced the tomato sauce flavour with butternut squash and candies walnuts, and added roasted chicken and some other ingredients to create a real seasonal favourite. The small size was around $12 all in and did me well for lunch. I'll be back for this!\n\nWe came back later in the day for dinner before a show, and both ordered pasta. As they make it all from scratch the menu can be customized endlessly to remove spicy things or allergy-inducing elements, and as such the restaurant is very friendly to people with either accommodative need.

I couldn't really taste the cheese and the duck pieces were very HARD, too hard to chew but the sauce was very flavourful. Overall, a very different pizza. \n\nService: It was pretty mediocre.

Love the bold mushroom flavor of this pizza.\nCarbonara - The pasta sauce is rich, cheesy, and creamy. \nBeef Ragu - This is meaty and packed with flavor. \n \nI would highly recommend Levetto for a casual bite!", 4], ["My husband and I get takeout from here fairly often and while I love Levetto, the dishes can be a little inconsistent. Sometimes there's too much cheese, sometimes not enough oil, a missing ingredient here and there.\n\nRegardless, it's a great place to pick up a decadent bowl of pasta. My favourite is the Aglio e Olio (we even made up a song for it).", 4], ["Overall, Levetto is a pretty decent place with good quality food at a reasonable price (an average of $15 per pasta dish and portions are pretty big too, so you get your money's worth there for sure). I only give it a four-star review because of the service. When we walked into the place we weren't greeted by the staff (who were just talking to each other) and we were a bit confused as to how the place works (with regards to seating and ordering). After asking one of the staff members I realized that it is a hybrid between self-service (you order at the counter and get your own cutlery) and cafe (they bring you drinks and food). Of course, this is a minor issue and I consider coming back again as the pasta was absolutely delicious!", 4], ["Their pasta and pizzas are delicious and not overly expensive. I have been here a few times and had at least 3 different pasta dishes and a couple of their pizzas. The only thing is their crust is pre-made or bought elsewhere. It's not a fresh dough. I saw the chef go downstairs to grab a bunch of pre-made dough to the kitchen. However, the dough is still very very good. It's a nice chance from the flat style pizzas sold in most Toronto restaurants these days. This restaurant is very small. There are no servers either. You pay at the counter, they give you a number and you pick up the food.", 5], ["Back to a 5 star place. Great value Italian food in the heart of Chinatown/Kensington border. \n\nPro tip: if you find the pasta carbonara too salty, we asked for the bacon on the side. That way, you don't get all the grease (salt!) in your meal! It works out perfectly delicious.\n\nWe will be back! If you're looking for affordable pasta without having to pay through the nose (Little Italy, King St, Queen St), give this place a try.", 5], ["This was just an OK experience for me, we ordered a shareable pizza, which ran us over $34, and what we got was pretty tiny, i mean my friend just laughed out loud when i came back from the door with this tiny box in my hand. what we got was just OK as far as flavor goes, but wow the size was just really disappointing, we actually measured it, it was 11\"x8\", pretty much the size of a legal sized page of paper. pretty tiny. laugh out loud tiny. Sadly the flavor of the pizza didn't save it, and it arrived ice cold as well, really poor experience, i usually don't get worked up about price if the flavor and quality was there, but unfortunately it wasn't present to save this pizza.

Sure, I could run in and out of the nearest Pizza Pizza and call it a day, but the sincere struggle was in resolving whether or not it was going to be worth the 3 miles I had just run. I decided I'd be more intentional about my search for a good pizza. About 0.5 miles later, I found myself at Levetto. Feeling a bit self conscious about dining in with sweat dripping down my face (and looking pretty rough, might I add), I had come to terms with ordering for take-out.\n\nI'll start by saying, I really appreciate the casual atmosphere of this place. The reality is, there aren't enough establishments that are able to offer a good specialty menu without serving up a pretentious vibe, no matter how cool or casual they are meaning to be. Sometimes people want to eat a fancy pizza without the full dine-in experience. I like that I could order my food, pay upfront and have the option to dine in or not. In fact, did end up dining in-- after all, who cares if I look a little rough??\n\nI ordered the Peking Duck Pizza, and this WAS worth it. \nA really good balance in textures and flavors-- savory and sweet.

Levetto has a variety of pizzas and pastas. We ordered the Bucatini Pasta and the Pollo Toscano Pizza. The Bucatini contained guanciale, sauteed red onions, chilli flakes, and a spicy tomato sauce. The Pollo Toscano was topped with chicken, sundried tomatoes, tomato pesto, red onion, and fresh basil.

I like how they brought us a pitcher of water and would refill it when it was empty. \n\nThe food:\n-Bucatini pasta: crunch from the guaniacle (Italian cured pork, like prosciutto), pasta had a nice consistency and length per strand. The pasta was coated in a thick tomato sauce that had a perfect blend of spices. \n-Pollo Toscano: everything was good besides the fresh basil.

The place was not busy at all since it was early. There was just only one worker working there. I have never seen her before and looks like she was just a one person operation. I came in, grabbed a menu and a table. I was ready to order but no one was at the counter so I got up to get her attention. She seemed kind of annoyed.  I got my original bingsoo but felt it was too icy and I immediately knew what was the problem. It lacked sauce, making it so dry. They used to give sauce on the side but no Korey. So I got up and asked her if I could have more sauce as it seemed very dry and the worker rolled her eyes at me while taking the bingsoo to add more sauce. I was like.. huh \n\nI thought maybe the employee was in a really bad mood because she was stuck working on long weekend.

The little flakes of bingsu melts very easily and you don't get much of the texture from the shaved ice pieces.\n\nThis isn't the best bingsu place, and also not the best price point either.

I came here in the afternoon around 3pm, not very busy around this time, but it did get more busy shortly due to school was over for the Christmas holidays. I am unsure if the owners are Korean anymore since I hear them spoke mandarin. Aside from that, do let them know that you have an allergy, I think they might be able to accommodate since they mentioned it on their counter and their menu. They do take out as well.\n\nAtmosphere 3/5\nOverall it looks nice but it is definitely dated, since two of the letters from their store name has fallen off already and hasn't been replaced at all. It is quint with some Korean decoration and writing. Some of the tables needs to be replaced or fixed since they wobbled. There is a fireplace with a TV above it, playing Korean music videos. Personally, I feel that it is unnecessary to put a TV there since most of the time no one is actually watching it. The round tables are too low, so you have to bend more to eat your food, which is very inconvenient and bad for your back. \n\nFood 4/5\nMy friend and I ordered the strawberry bingsoo (with ice cream) and the mango bingsoo (without the ice cream), both small. Honestly, the small was a good size for the both of us. I am unsure of what the small size used to be but regardless, we were quite happy with the dessert. There were two layers of fruit. I am not surprised that they are using frozen fruits since strawberries aren't in season and similar with other fruits. We enjoyed the dessert and probably going to try a different flavour next time.\n\nService (2.5/5)\nAt first I wanted to try their Coconut Bingsoo. But they didn't have it. I am unsure if they ran out or it is just unavailable completely or maybe it is seasonal. They didn't really explain it, which is something that I don't like. They didn't speak English very well but they spoke enough so you can place an order. The service were not friendly, not a service with a smile.

I loved the little mocchi bites on the top and the layering of redbean paste halfway down the bowl. The shaved ice portion is creamy and soft, melting evenly and leaving a clean taste on your tongue. It's not heavy, so you can keep eating without feeling full or gross. The mixed fruit bingsoo is much sweeter and sugary than the injeolmi. The fruits are fresh and holds up well to the sweeter shaved ice. Also, there is a scoop of vanilla icecream on the top for extra creaminess!\n\nAdmittedly it's on the pricey side for what you get but it's a lovely treat, especially on a hot day but you want something lighter than icecream or gelato.

I had to get their attention whenever I wanted something which was typical for Asian places, but at least they never forgot anything.", 4], ["This has to be in my top three of sushi places in the city. They have so many yummy rolls to choose from it's always difficult to pick. I always try to go with at least one other person if not more so that we can get many things and share them. Even the soup that you get at the beginning is really yummy and has almost a sesame flavour to it with little crispy tempura bits in it and then tender noodles.\n\nMy favourite rolls are the Toronto roll which has salmon and tuna and avocado in it and the Rocky Mountain role which has spicy salmon on the inside then salmon on the outside with a slice of jalape\u00f1o on each piece and a coconut yoghurt drizzle which sounds kind of strange but is hella delicious and then coconut flakes. It's the perfect mix of sweet and salty with the spiciness of the inside and the crispiness of the tempura bits in the chewiness of the coconut. Highly suggest!", 5], ["Nice place to get pretty good sushi rolls at a low price point. The fish wasn't as fresh as some other sushi places but the overall delivery and taste of the rolls was still good.

I already knew I wanted to order sushi so I got the Roll Set 5 Spicy combo.  K ordered the Roll Set 2 (14 pcs) with Tempura.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and because we were hungry, we also ordered the Chicken Katsu and Edamame for starters too.\n\nWe were first given a bowl of miso soup and \"Noodle Crunch Soup\" each to start.  Ken was impressed that we had the later bowl of soup too and how big the first bowl was.  I liked the Noodle Crunch Soup just as much as I did the first time around.\n\nThe \"Chicken Katsu\" was thin strips of chicken fried.  It was just okay to me; I liked the plum sauce that came with it though.\n\nThe Edamame was average.\n\nSince the server knew we were sharing our food, both of our roll sets got combined onto one plate.  I love the presentation of food here!  Also, their service was really good; the female server was so friendly and smiley.\n\nThe plate of our sushi rolls looked so good.  Just as they did two years ago, they still serve their sushi platters with a sake cup of fake flowers.\n\nMmm, the sushi was good.  I was reminded on this visit of how good the ratio of rice to fish is.  There was barely any rice seen in the rolls!  This was really nice.  I enjoyed satisfying my craving of sushi rolls.  I ended up really enjoying the California roll in K's roll set more than the ones I had since the California roll tasted cleaner.  By that, I mean that it was more simple flavours and doesn't have too much overflavouring.  The Spider Roll was surprisingly just okay to me; it was a little hard.\n\nThe shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura were good.  I really like broccoli tempura.\n\nWe finished the meal again with some sliced oranges in Japanese style!\n\nYay for a great return meal here at ToNe Sushi!  I know this is a solid spot for sure now.", 4], ["To-ne Sushi left me far from disappointed. In fact, I left with a stomach full to the brim. My friends and I (group of 3) ordered a sushi platter. To my belief, it was 60 piece. Although, I could be mistaken; it was a substantial amount for us. It included mixed fish, avocado rolls, California rolls, and a plethora of others. You really can't go wrong with this board as it allows you to taste a bit of everything. Well, a lot of everything!

It was nicely presented with flowers and a fancy cut cucumber. There was a good selection of sashimi and sushi. With an avocado and tempura shrimp roll  and a basic plain salmon roll.

There was a thinly sliced jalapeno with each piece of aji, lemon slices for the kanpachi, and nicely seared pieces of aburo sashimi.  It tasted very fresh and filling.

The rolls in other pictures seem quite a bit above average, however I wish there were more blow torched sushi options. The designs of the roles seem quite intricate, there seems to be an above par depiction in ingredients but definitely not differentiating from the norm that much.\n\nWe also tried some of their tempura, interesting design with a huge circular taro chip, but me personally would not order another tempura next time because to me tempura is fried, unhealthy and tastes the same as any other Japanese restaurant generally. Unless 1 decides to douse it in aioli oil with some other type of flavoring of flour and sprinkle with some seaweed, bonito flakes or something innovative then maybe I'd reconsider..\n\nThe complementary miso-enoki soup was great, but given that the sushi was ordinary it doesn't compensate for the common selection. The butterfish was quite good tho, as it melted in my mouth, generally I'd say that some buffets may seem a bit tougher at first.\n\nKorean owned Japanese restaurant that I would try and suggest improving your service quality. It seemed that the waiters and waitresses were kind of flailing to take orders but when I needed them had difficulty grabbing their attention or even finding them.

We all ordered something that came with complimentary miso soup... But that arrived only after this mini ramen appetizer? And then some of us had salad in our dinner set? By the time my tempura arrived I was sadly full of liquids but the tempura was very fresh so I chowed down anyway! I found that all the maki had an UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF AVOCADO, not that I'm complaining because I love avocado, but it seriously filled me up (and I can see it being overwhelming for those who don't like the taste). \n\nOverall the food is of excellent value and good quality!

The actual food was decent.  The sushi was decent.  Not the worse but certainly not the best but for the price point it was average to above average depending on the fish.  I ordered some uni to see how fresh it was.  It was fresh but too cold so it didn't quite have that melt in your mouth quality that I like.  \n\nI had black cod.  it's cooked and fatty, so hard to overcook that one.  \nThe free eppetizers were tempura vegetables and a small somen noodle sampling. The tempura were fried nicely in clean oil.   The somen was tasty.\nThe only other thing they did to keep us from boiling over was let us pay separately as opposed to forcing the 15% gratuity.  I appreciated that.  \n\nI was told by one of my mates that they have been several times without incident.  And it was quite busy when I arrived...usually all good signs.

I'll definitely be coming back.", 5], ["Maybe an off- night? Excellent service, as always. No A/C, it was an oven. Village salad incredible. Calamari good. Grilled Octopus appetizer was tiny, and smelled rotten.. a rip-off. Potatoes were raw, no flavor. Baklava had uncooked dough, and syrup tasted like cheap corn syrup, not homemade syrup made with honey. Very overpriced for quality. I come here every couple of years, when visiting family. Every time it gets a little bit worse, but again...service spectacular. For the prices, and jam packed business, they should invest in a decent bathroom. Filthy and ancient.", 3], ["Long wait time.

Hmm the quails were just bland. Devoid of taste and not very meaty. The sides of potato was OK and the rice was forgettable. \nI did try the saganaki as dc ordered it as well.

These little things are what I look for in repeat visits at a restaurant especially where there are vast competitions with exact food on the same street. \n\nWe ordered a lot and the foods were ok but did notice the flavour has declined from before and our souvlaki was hard and dry.  The worst was we ordered saganaki (flaming cheese) and the gentleman lit the flame shortly before he even got to our table and just put it down.  Excuse me but where was our OPA???  I get it you didn't give two crap about our table but why the difference in treatment because I observed your attitude was 180 and friendly with other patrons.

This is a MUST.\n\nWe went at 8:15 on a Friday night. I'm not much of a fan of Greek food, but the experience was a delight of rustic charm and great food.\n\n1. Service\nDid I say rustic charm? The staff HAS IT. All Greek, all men, they were friendly and attentive, full of masculine vigor and willing to chat despite the constantly full restaurant.\n\n2. Food\nTo die for. As a meatatarian, I absolutely adored their kebabs. The pork and chicken were gently seared and very moist. The lamb was cooked and spiced to perfection and not gamey. The garlic butter pita was traditional but very flavorful. My partner loved their cold mashed garlic potatoes.\n\n3. Atmosphere\nLoud. Raucous. Always full of people enjoying food,wine and company. If you're looking for something less busy, noisy, or more romantic, this place may not be for you. Could be a bit dim for some.\n\n4. Experience\nThis is Greek hospitality at its finest. While you may still need to wait even if you got a reservation, the food and staff make it worth the effort. It's a bit difficult to chat if you have hearing issues or are soft spoken. That's the only reason for a four out of five; it's not great for intimate conversation.\n\nI definitely recommend this place for everyone!", 4], ["Came here on a Tuesday night and by 8pm, the place was bumping! \n\nFood - stellar. You can order small plates to share with your fellow diners, which is highly recommended. However, they do have full entrees if you'd prefer not to share. I highly recommend the caviar dip, spanikopita, the rodos salad, and the lamb chops. I had the greek fries too, which were good. What I loved was that we were able to share all the plates, but order our own proteins (chicken skewer, lamb chop, etc). \n\nDrinks - they have a wine list - not sure about cocktails but I wouldn't be surprised if they had the regular bar rail available. I enjoyed a glass of white. \n\nVibe - this is a lively restaurant to enjoy good food and good company. Every so often someone will order the flaming cheese and that always gets a rise out of the crowd. There were also a few birthdays here! Service was very friendly and attentive. \n\nPrice wise, we ordered more food than we could finish, and 2 glasses of wine (total for the table) - came to about 26$ each. Not bad at all! \n\nI have only positive things to say about this place. Since I haven't tasted all the greek food that is out there, I can't say this is the best, but its my favourite place on the danforth so far.", 4], ["We went to Mezes for dinner last night and could not be happier with our choice of venue. We waited less than 10 min to get a table on the patio. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was absolutely delicious. I guess I never really tried proper greek food opting for cheaper places in the past. This experience has changed my appreciation for authentic Greek food. The dips and the seafood I tried were absolutely irresistible. The calamari were freshly fried with rice and a salad sprinkled with feta bits. After my meal, I felt full, yet not heavy in my stomach like I sometimes feel after eating animal products. All in all, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. With an average entree price of $20-$23, you bill will likely be around $50-$60 +tax with drinks for 2 people.", 5], ["Came here with a small group for a re-energizing lunch after a walking touring that ended at Woodbine Beach and Ashbridge's Bay.\nWow, t'was a truly meze-style experience especially after the way the intricately patterned plates looked at our table.\nIt's been a long time since I tried to appreciate eggplant but man, the fried eggplant with the yogurt(?) condiment was so light with a light crisp coating. And also one of my table-mates shared a taste of his meatballs. First bite into one was just describable! The centre didn't feel dense and meaty and it was such a different texture, the accompanying tomato sauce also added some zing to it. Each of us that tried one love it. \nAlso needing a notable mention was the Taramosalata that was included as part of their dip platter which included three others. This is the first time ever that I have tried this notable culinary pride of the Greeks and I loved it. The soft, creamy paste had a good balance of the red roe mixed it in it and the garlic pitas were also scrumptious that we order a second plate them so that we could clean up the other dips. The Spanakopitas also looked quaint in their triangular forms. The Saganaki was a treat to see being flambeed before it was placed at our table but it would have tasted really good if we had eaten it immediately.\nThe service here was kind of interesting, like a subtle way of showing concern for the needs of the patrons. The was one notable thing that our Serve did for one member of the table and because it was a rather grey, cold Saturday afternoon. He suggested that he could pull the plastic sheets that cover parts of the patio so that the cold air did not get to us. And it was only then that I noticed that our table-mate had wrapped herself up with a shawl. That was a neat gesture on his part :-)\nIt was definitely a feast for the eyes and our palettes.

I would understand if this was a complicated and intricate pastry to construct, but it is really not. So you can't justify the price at all.\n\nThe bottom crust was SO hard that it was impossible to eat with a plastic fork because it wouldn't cut through.

My food was just mediocre. I was still hungry after and I have a small appetite at 100lb weight class.  It felt very European portion sizing.  My butter was not warm or melted and came with an untoasted baguette that was not the softest.  However felt very euro tasting.  I got a the salmon rosti scrambled eggs.  Tasty but did dip everything in ketchup.  I would say the price could be cheaper for its portion sizing.  I wouldn't recommend making a journey out here but guess wouldn't mind coming back", 3], ["It's ok. I guess I don't really understand why people seem to like it so much, besides that it's reasonably priced. Came here for brunch and luckily we sat down right away.

The salad vinaigrette was nice but mine was soaking in it. I also don't really understand why the mains come with a piece of baguette- it was too starchy.\n\nAlso, the service was extremely slow. We ordered pretty quickly but the food took a long time to arrive. When we requested the bill, that took a long time also.

We saw there were empty tables and all the 10 people that were waiting after us were got seated. and All Felix got to say was \"Well, it LOOKS PRETTY FULL TO ME now\".

And the atmosphere is quaint (very small place, wooden tables with tablecloths, art and old photos on the walls).     \n\nThe downside is ...:\n\nWhile the pastries are delicious - and I think the reason most people visit - the service at the counter is abysmal.   If you're thinking about stopping to pick up a croissant or brioche - keep walking unless you want to be treated with disdain (on a good day) and contempt (on a bad).    I thought it was just my experience here but after talking to a couple of friends we realized we've ALL had the same experience.

In one sitting. There are many, many more sittings and on an average month of 26 days (they don't open on Mondays), you can do the month of how much they can earn. What is missing from my equation is the understanding of their fixed costs and variable costs, and the negotiations that occur with trusted suppliers.

After days of contemplation and deep meditation, this pointless honor goes to none other than Bonjour Brioche, my current fave croissant in Canada.\n\nIt is the most buttery of all croissants I've tasted which is a plus for me but a minus for my overall health. I know something is good if I prefer it plain over other variations. (Ex: Plain croissant over almond/chocolate croissant; simple steak over steak with gravy and other sauces, etc). This particular croissant fits the bill. Its flaky, it's still good after heating it up in the oven, it's awesome. It probably also helps that for some reason, it is the only croissant I've had so far that I ate while freshly baked which could be a big reason for my bias.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve about this place is the awful dining situation they have here. Parking options are terrible, dinner area is microscopic and always full, and the drive I have to make to get here isn't the most favorable.  I'd give the establishment a 2, but I like the croissant so much it adds 2 points all by itself.", 4], ["This place was on Queen St East for over 10 years, before new restaurants and bakeries started popping up and I am sure it has something to do with the gentrification of this neighbourhood.\n\nThe menu is fairly extensive and not the egg-and-bacon-and-home fries you find at some local greasy spoons. The sandwiches are overall good but it's the brunch that people come here for.\n\nScrambled egg on a bed of rosti potatoes and a slice of smoked salmon is garnished with chives, a dollop of creamy horseradish and a small drop of caviar. The presentation definitely whets the appetite. The baked French toast is very dense, almost bread pudding like, layered with cinnamon and caramelized sugar and portion is very generous.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 features soup, quiche, omelet and savoury tart du jour, written on the two chalkboards. The tarts are my personal favourite. The flaky pastry holds a trio of ingredients, (always one kind of cheese and two other what-have-you) generally creates a great harmony. The portion is small, but it is rich and packed with flavour, so every bite counts. On the side is a wedge of baguette and house salad. However, the butter on my baguette on most visits is clearly straight out of the fridge and hard to spread.\n\nAmong the bakery selections, the croissants and baguettes are their stable best sellers, then there are the desserts. The flourless chocolate cake is dense and moist, rich but not too sweet. The very French almond pear pie is also memorable: thinly sliced pear tops a ground almond paste, similar to marzipan, in a lovely pie shell.\n\nThe servers are friendly but given how packed they normally are (there is always a line out the door on weekend), it's not always the most attentive. One time, the glass of water I asked didn't come until I was almost done with my meal. \n\nThe place does not take anything except cash but have recently installed an ATM there.\n\nLast, you can take the gal out of the caf\u00e9 but you can't take the caf\u00e9 out of the gal.

There are many pros and cons about this place - perhaps the most popular brunch in up-and-coming Leslieville.\nIn the end, it's probably most realistic to settle with 3 stars, no more or less. Too bad, since it's probably my first choice for brunch in the whole city.\n\nLet's start with the bad:\n- VERY bad service. Up to the point that some of the servers are even rude. Coffee is brought to your table without any cream or milk, no cutlery (standard for the Toronto brunch places, who needs a fork and knife for breakfast these days?)\n- Umm, back to the coffee, when you ask for some milk, of course they never bring it. At least the cappuccino is ok...\n- Place is too small, tables are awkwardly positioned/ too near to each other and it's always packed. The whole atmosphere is somehow frantic (not at all what you would expect from a small French-style cafe/bakery/brunch), servers are running around nervously... \n- Prepare cash!!! NO card is accepted (real 21st century style), and the cash machine downstairs is charging the most expensive fee you've ever seen for an ATM\n\nHowever, the food is really good. Sandwiches are always fresh (try the beef!), salad is not bad at all, Croque Madam is amazing, brioche royale is a perfect dessert (arrive early for this one, always gets sold out!)...

I really liked that the cake wasn't super sweet, but you could still taste the matcha flavor. I could eat more slices of that cake if I wasn't so full. \n\nNext was the matcha tiramisu. I was used to eating the Italian-styled dessert which was coffee flavored, so this was really different from anything that I've had. The Japanese spin on this Italian dessert was a pleasant surprise. I loved the strong matcha flavor, which complimented the custard filling. \n\nFor the drinks, I got the matcha latte sweetened. The cup was a bit uncomfortable since there wasn't a cup handle. The drink itself was good though! Although it was sweetened, it wasn't too sweet to the point where I couldn't eat it with the desserts. It went well with the matcha desserts that we got :) My boyfriend got the black lavender tea, which was basically black tea with lavender syrup.

The restaurant was full except for two tables, and I snagged one of them while waiting for my friend to arrive. Once he did, we ordered, and I got the large lanzhou beef noodle soup with wide noodles. We didn't have to wait too long for the noodles, and once they came, wow it was a really big bowl! There were a ton of noodles, very delicious noodles. The noodles were really chewy and long, and I was really impressed. The spicy sauce on top was also very savory and tasty. The daikon was a bit too hard for my liking, and there wasn't a lot of beef. The noodles were also a bit too long and difficult to eat, but I do know that's one of the signs of a good noodle maker. For the amount of food, $12 (CAD) post-tax was very reasonable. Service wasn't very existent, but it wasn't too bad.

Size L is massive if you're hungry.\n- We both got the thin noodles and thought they were good but a touch too chewy (not sure if we should attribute to the fact we came so late).\n\nTLDR; Broth was delicious.

For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. \n\nWe were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. \n\nThe food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.\n\nBut, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here.", 3], ["This is the most authentic hand pulled noodles I've had in North America.

It was almost immediate after we ordered, and we had a group of 7, most of whom ordered the flat noodles, which I feel like are probably less popular in the West. \n\nThe presentation of the noodles was very aesthetic. I usually don't take pictures of my food because my friend has a better camera but I wanted to send a picture to my parents for when they come to Toronto. The noodles were hidden below the beef slices which were arrayed below the surface of the broth, with the radish, cilantro, and onions stacked in the middle. \n\nThe food itself was very delicious - the noodles were supple and boiled to perfection, the broth was delicious and hot, but not too hot, and the chili oil was both spicy and fragrant.\n\nAfter finishing, our server asked how the food was, and I felt embarrassed that my Chinese isn't good enough to fully express how much I enjoyed the experience, so I just told him \"See you tomorrow\".\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied. I only regret that I wasn't super hungry before eating, so I couldn't drink all the soup and only got the Large instead of the MEGA size.

It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.\n\nWe ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good.

The best thing about this place is that they hand-pull the noodle freshly in front of you after you customize and choose the thinness and thickness of noodle. We got the 2 types of dry noodles, and they both came with a small bowl of light soup broth. The minced homemade pork was seasoned and flavoured amazingly, the pork sauce mixed really well with the veggies and the ribbon medium-wide noodle, had an awesome chew + thickness!

It's a classic noodle joint where you dine & dash. The noodles are hand pulled and made fresh in house, you get to hear/see the noodle maker beating the dough and pulling the noodles.

I'm comparing to Chinese Halal which also has hand pulled fresh noodles in house. But for downtown this is an OK shop. It's not ramen though. It's la mien. Please don't mislead. That's like calling kung fu karate because more people like karate. \n\nI would suggest going to Homemade Ramen on Spadina just south of Dundas, for handpulled noodles downtown.

The flat noodles are slightly softer. \nBeef: the most beef I've ever seen in a bowl of Lanzhou noodles! So good, large slices, doesn't fall apart/melt in the soup! I like this more than the usual cut of beef in LZ noodles.\nRadish: cooked, would prefer if sliced thinner\n\nCame around 12:45pm on a Friday with no line up!

The chef is definitely skilled at pulling the noodles and got can watch him at work behind the glass. The added benefit of the open kitchen is that you can see the restaurant is quite clean. The noodle thickness and size is dependent on preference but I usually get round thin as that is the most common noodle. The soup itself is not bad but I find it a bit bland. You need to add a lot of hot chilli oil in order to get the soup to be more flavourful. The chili oil isn't too spicy but it does have a little kick to it. The beef is not that big. It is tender but I don't find it flavourful. I do enjoy the bowl of noodles as a whole, definitely a good place to eat after shopping at Eatons!", 4], ["I've been 3 times and every time seems better than the last.

You will not regret this place", 5], ["I loved my experience here. Finally got to try traditional noodle soup that's halal! The large size is huge and if you're only mildly hungry you can share this between two people. They're also great in that they can accommodate different salt levels -- I can't handle a lot of salt so I asked for very less salt and my soup was perfect.", 5], ["Walking in to realize it is actually a small diner, the design of the restaurant actually doesn't quite flow, at most 30 customers at a time and I can see servers bumping into each other. The servers are not the best experienced ones as they are pre-occupied with whatever that they have at hands and do not have the flexibility to greet customers at the entrance. Typical sign of asian places, do not expect wonderful customer service but they are polite and hard working.\n\nOrdered the signature noodles (large) extra spicy - very good broth, quite clear, and the spicy level is just the right heat. I absolutely loved the fact that they let you pick the width of the noodles, this means that they hand pull the noodles as you order! I honestly do not think there are a lot of places that can offer that kind of customization and we are talking about downtown Toronto! Not even a lot of places in Markham offers that. I picked \"Flat\" because flat noodles are hard to find. Al dente!!!!!!\n\nOverall 4 stars due to below average of customer service but food is good, price is very reasonable and quick dine in and out. Definitely recommend and will definitely come back for more! Next time I would like to try their apps :)", 4], ["I come here a lot! Although there are other places with hand-pulled noodles near Dundas, I really like this place. You can pick the size of your noodles and I really like the soup base for the noodles.

I would say at max, they can seat a table of 4 people easily but be prepare you will need to wait.

We were in the area looking for food and decided to come here thanks to Google. \n\nWe just made it in before the dinner rush (arrived around 5:30pm) and each ordered a bowl of noodles (I got the beef tendon noodles and my friend got the pork sauce noodles).  The portion was a good size and tasted pretty good.  The downside was the wait -- since the noodles are hand-made, you have to wait a while for your order.  We were seated at the bar, so we watched the kitchen staff prep the bowls.\n\nWhen we were done, there's not much of table service, so you need to go to the front to pay.  It's already super crowded and congested at the entrance, not to mention the restaurant itself is tiny, so you're awkwardly hovering while the staff ask you where you sat and what you ate before you can get the bill and pay.\n\nBy the time we left, the line was already spilling down the street... unsure if it's because of the hype or that the noodles are amazing, but for folks who work and live downtown, this is probably one of the few places you can get hand-pulled noodles.  Otherwise, try other places uptown in Scarborough or Markham -- it's much cheaper there.", 3], ["4 stars for delicious broth, good portions of meat, and flavourful chili oil. \n\nWe ordered the mega bowl, which came with chewy noodles and enough meat for two people. I enjoyed the aroma of the soup and its taste, too. As the soup cooled down, it seemed that the oils at the surface were less than the oils that I would see at other noodle places that I've been.  Unfortunately, the waiter spilled my cup of water, which I usually down with soup noodles -- BUT, I wasn't that thirsty after the meal, at least not so much as when soups are laden with salt/msg at other places. Maybe they use less msg?? That'd be a plus for me. \n\nAs with other many  noodle places, it's small -- it's good for a quick meal, but not really a place to sit and talk as they will give you your bill pretty quickly (before you ask). \n\nI'd go back!", 4], ["They have a great noodle soup and Toronto knows it (just look at the lineup) ! They serve two types of noodles exclusively but they do it so well. \n\nMy go too is a small bowl of extra spicy beef broth noodles with the second thinnest noodles.

The noodles are a nice chewiness and will not become mushy as you take your time eating.\n\nOverall, a great coup noodle restaurant!", 5], ["Small menu, but that also means good quality!  I got the small beef noodles with flat noodles (there are many noodle sizes to choose from). The small is really filling, I cant imagine finishing the mega size! The beef was also cooked really well.

It is a little cramped and busy though, so definitely get there earlier :)", 5], ["Excellent beef noodles. They pull the noodles fresh everyday and you get a good portion of them.

The noodles are solid, and the largest size is COMICALLY LARGE. As in, I actually laughed out loud when I saw it go by my table. This is truly a cheap eats gem. \n\nSide note: I also got the tea egg. It was nothing special. Stick to the noodles.", 4], ["This is a great location with close access to the subway and Eaton centre, and I have to admit I'm somewhat mesmerized by the noodle-making on display. Quite an art to it. Plus, they taste delicious. As has been noted in other reviews, you're getting generous portions at reasonable prices. Service is fast and water/beverage refills remarkably adept in spite of the crowds.\n\nPro tip: don't try to come here with any baggage or briefcases: the tables are so tiny and close together that you'll need to balance items on your feet while slurping noodles.", 4], ["My friend and I both ordered a large size of the beef noodle bowl, he went with medium wide (second largest size) noodles and I went with extreme wide noodles (largest size). The noodles themselves are really good, nice texture and it's really fun to select a specific noodle size/type to go in you dish and know it's freshly pulled to order. I found the extreme wide noodles very consistent and slightly wider and thicker than the medium wide, which was thinner and silkier. The medium wide also didn't seem as consistent as mine was but overall we both really liked the noodles here. \n\nThe soup itself is more of a bone broth type soup, so it's a bit plain, akin to soup a beef soup stock but with a bit more flavour. I personally really liked it since it's kind of like noodle soups my mom made growing up but I can see how some people would feel that it's a bit flat. It also comes with scallions, cilantro and desired spice level. The chili oil here is SO good. I added more to my soup since each table has a container of it. I liked the flavour of this lighter soup it come super hot so it was perfect for a cold day. \n\nThe noodles are topped with thinly sliced beef and a few slices of daikon radish. I really like beef and daikon together in general, I think it's such a classic soup combo. The beef itself was a bit disappointing though, the slices were a bit chewy and most often than not, dry tasting. I wish they'd have more tender beef. This is my main reason for marking my review lower. \n\nOverall, I still liked my dish and it'll satisfy my noodle cravings. I would like to go back to try their pork sauce noodle though and maybe their weekend only brisket noodle soup, which I would hope is more tender and moist than their regular sliced beef.", 3], ["I really enjoyed my experience at Tasty's and can't wait till I'm back in Toronto to revisit this establishment. Starving on a Thursday night... I decided to finally try Roti (the traditional Trinidadian dish). Boyyyy am I glad I settled on Tasty's...Thank You Yelp!! \n\nI arrived about 30 mins before closing (wouldn't recommend this because they ran out of most the items on the menu.) Thankfully the Chicken Curry Roti was still available, I ordered this to go and waited about 20 minutes. They were pretty busy and traffic was moderate, would assume this is a popular place due to the ambience. The owners were very accommodating and served their costumers with respect. \n\nThe Roti was amazing!!! Hot, fresh, well seasoned and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Been craving it ever since. Can't wait to return!", 5], ["The first time I came here was in early 2016 and since then I marked this place as somewhere I absolutely have to come whenever I'm in Toronto for an extended period of time. Since then they've moved around the corner to a slightly bigger and more modern location since they're putting up MORE condominiums where the old business was.\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: There's nothing fancy about this place, but there doesn't need to be. It's straight to the point. You walk in and take a few steps up into the cozy establishment decorated with Caribbean artifacts. There are small tables on right side, but this place is known better as a to-go spot. Straight ahead is where you place your order, you see it made for you and you get sent on your way!\n\nService: There is no table service here, but the people who have assisted me at the counter were always friendly and got me what I needed.\n\nFood: The reason why you come here. I will never forget the moment I saw \"Curry Boneless Goat\" on the menu. I couldn't believe it. Everywhere else I had ever had goat had all types of sharp and irritating bones in it, but... here... boneless?! Impossible! How do they do it?! I ain't ask questions. I ordered and had my life changed at first bite. Cooked perfectly, soft, savory, spicy, curry-y-y-y, exactly how it was supposed to! I absolutely loved it and vowed to ever order anything other than the Curry Boneless Goat from here! Of course they have regular goat with bones for a cheaper price, but nah... who wants to deal with bones?!\n\nPrice: All prices are in $CAD. $16.00 for my huge box of goat, cabbage and red beans & rice. I was able to make 2 sizable meals out of this one order so it's absolutely worth the money here.\n\nIn conclusion I love this place and you will too if give it a try. There's nothing NOT to love.

In 2016 they didn't, but I'm so happy they upgraded!", 5], ["Verdict: I'll be back\n\n---\n\nSo I ended up here last week for lunch one day while trying to decided what I wanted to eat. Turned out they had a lunch special, jerk chicken, rice and peas, and slaw - which I just couldn't turn down.\n\nThere was a bit of line up when I got there, which is usually a good sign so I was excited.\n\nThe portion size for the lunch special was alright, but I wouldn't have minded a little more food - but it's hard to complain at the price point (6.99  + tax).\n\nThe jerk chicken was juicy, flavourful, and spicy, the rice and peas had a wonderful flavour too, but the coleslaw stole the show. It was sweet, wet, and perfect! There are a few other jerk chicken places in the area and Tasty's is definitely in competition to be a new favourite. OH! And they have this hot sauce in a bottle on the counter on the way out that is brilliant.

The chicken is juicy and was just piled there when I went during opening hours this past Wednesday. The spices are the /perfect/ amount to experience spicy jerk without burning my tongue off (although I have not tasted other jerk places because this is my go-to). I like how they have a table aside to help yourself to utensils, napkins, and plastic bags (you can be environmentally-friendly or not as you want, except for the mandatory packaging in styrofoam for take-out since I haven't tried sitting in). Included is another table of their own sauces (which I also have not tried) if you want to amp up your taste buds. The portion is ideal for the price in my opinion. Highly recommend for a quick bite in the area. \n\nNOTE: best to pay with cash or credit, there's a fee or they can't take orders below a certain value, which includes the daily special.", 5], ["Very good spot to grab some Jamaican food. They had everything from jerk chicken to oxtail, and I decided to go with the goat and vegetables. It was quite spicy for being mild, but I still really enjoyed it, and the mango drink I got with it went very well with the food. The portions were enough with a good amount of meat, and the meat itself had just the right amount of chewiness. Overall, a great spot to get food especially if it's quite late at night. I will definitely be back in the future.", 4], ["Perhaps this was just an off day for them. Most Caribbean restaurants are on point with all their food but I sadly must say Tasty's wasn't very tasty.

Massive and stuffed and deliciously spicy, accompanied by some of the most delicious house-made hot sauces (three levels of spicy to choose from - or all three like I did!)

I've also never had jerk chicken before coming to Toronto that I know of, but after eating at least three different jerk chicken, I have to say that this place is one of, if not the definitive, best places to get jerk chicken. Their jerk chicken practically falls off the bones and is seasoned very well.\n\nThey also have a great location for UofT students and pretty good prices. Their jerk chicken special (a small cubular box) is about $6, if I remember correctly, $9 for a regular box that's about twice the size of a special, and $11 for the large, which is maybe 80% larger than a regular (I'm just eyeballing the sizes). I didn't include the tax, so just multiply everything by 1.13 for the final price.\n\n10/10 would recommend. Unless you're not a fan of picking out bones, but I mean, it's a chicken.

The bread was so tender and perfect and it was a huge piece. \n\nThe duck confit Benny was good but a little dry. The confit maybe was heated per portion which got rid of that nice duck fat moistness you would expect and it's in a biscuit so that added to the dryness.

Unfortunately, the quality of both service and food has drastically gone down in the last several months. \n\nWhile I enjoy a free meal, I would much rather pay for a quality meal than be comped for a poor one. Sadly, my expectations have been completely reset. On my last visit I ordered the duck poutine - sounded delicious! Problem was it arrived without any duck and was just a messy bowl of fries, cheese and gravy. I asked the waitress who apologized and said the kitchen could get a side bowl of duck ready for me in 20 minutes while my poutine went cold. Apparently doing the the full order again was out of the question. Well, there was free meal # 1.\n\nThe visit before I went for the fish and chips. The batter on the fish was not even close to cooked and was still a paste when it arrived. The waitress who dropped it off looked at the plate and apologized before I could even mention it.  Again, I was comped for the meal but would have rather just paid for an edible one.\n\nBeing a recognized regular in the bar, several months ago one of the managers approached me and asked if I would be kind enough to do a survey with Parcel Designs, one of Prohibition's third party partners who were evaluating the bar. In exchange, I would get a $50 gift card for Prohibition mailed to me. Well the survey was completed back in July and I'm still waiting to receive it. I mentioned it last month to the same manager who took down my contact info and guess what....still nothing.\n\nShame about this place going downhill so rapidly. The hooch hour selection is sadly the only redeeming quality left. That is, unless you enjoy meals so poorly prepared the staff offers to take it off the bill before you even complain.", 1], ["Our dinner started well, until I found a black hair in my mac n cheese.

A cover charge and dress code is in effect on Friday & Saturday party nights.\n\nSeveral large TV screens were showing an NFL game, the Raptors game and the Leafs game.\n\nUltra premium bar rail is $7.30 all day every day and only $5.75 during Hooch Hour from 5-7pm and 10-11pm nightly.  If tap is your fancy, choose from several draughts and ciders on tap.

My friend is having the Fish and Avocado Tacos for $15.95.  Very nice..and delicious.\n\nOverall, it's a different crowd here and I really liked it.

The bar is right smack in the middle of the place and the servers are all running around.\n\nService/Staff?\nThe servers were great! Very polite and knowledgable about the food and drinks. The food came quickly and always asked for refills and took away plates quickly as well.\n\nFood/Menu?\nWe started with the karaage chicken and salmon sashimi. The karaage chicken was well seasoned and tasted so cool! The flavours were a mix of asian and western flavours. The salmon sashimi was good but nothing to die for. The toppings of the seasoning didn't play together well. Next for our entrees we got the truffle mac and cheese and \"the rib\". The truffle mac and cheese was heavy on the truffle. The rib was good but a lot of fatty pieces. Overall, all the plates were pretty small and miniature. Not sure if that's because of summerlicious or if that's the regular size but it was still filling! Lastly, we got our desserts. A lemon mousse and a chocolate cake. Those were not worth the money and we probably wouldn't order it again. Keep in mind, we aren't the biggest fan of sweets anyways.", 3], ["The vibe is like Jack Astor's or some general bar and grill.

Otherwise, walk over a few blocks east and you'll find some better spots for a quiet dining experience.", 3], ["This was a fun spot to come to for some drinks and dancing on a Saturday night. The crowd certainly was a mixed bag of nuts, but the vibe was friendly and felt very safe.

I also love that I could happily order an entire bottle of champagne for myself and was even served in a bottle service bucket since my friend and I felt like being extra.

I really like a lot of the food too... the nachos are huge (make sure you share), the breakfast poutine is amazing and comes with tater tots rather than fries, and I also love the wings. Their mac and cheese is ok... lacking some flavor. \n\nFor sports fans, they don't always play the sound on the sports events unless most of the customers request it.

I wasn't impressed with this because of the spacing I had to pull out the table and chairs to give us enough room to sit down, and accommodate the people around us, plus the music is very loud, to the point, I couldn't talk to my s/o!. we were greeted by our server who recommended the drink menu to start us off, and then just disappeared, I couldn't help but notice the drink menu having \"all day, everyday party shots\" for a steal at $2.43 a shot(jager or JD honey) which I thought was a pretty good deal, and it is, especially when you see the other shots on the menu ranging from 5-7 bucks, all the way up to 28.41 for a portion of specialty whiskey(I really wish I got a photo with that/I say portion because it wasn't clearly outlined what size the shot would be showing up as) what made this even more jaw dropping was the fact that this item had a blue crown beside it...I looked on our table and noticed a blue crown with a sign attached to it, which basically said premium drinks at an extra charge, ok so we didn't come in at hooch hour, I get it, but this menu was insane. 14.21 for a portion of grey goose? highway robbery. my s.o and I decided to just stick to water. and we began to look over the food menu. now from the very get-go I had my heart set out on the duck poutine, so I knew I was having that, but there were other items on the menu, so I figured I would give it a once over. what really puzzled me was the fish section of the menu, none of the items had pricing, the only thing it said was \"price based on daily market share\" I took this from a very stand offish point, almost like saying \"we don't know the price, neither do you...so don't order it ok?\" the other thing to the menu that made me shake my head was the additions you could have on anything and everything, extra bacon, a cheese sauce(7 bucks!) and if you told the server to \"FG it\":, you would get some foie gras on everything. when the waitress decided to grace us with her presence, I honestly wasn't done looking at the menu/decided on anything, so she came around to ask us if we wanted drinks, to which we both replied water is fine, within about 2 seconds of the words leaving our mouth, I felt like a switch just turned off in her head, any smile, happiness, or general eagerness to provide a good service just shut down completely. fast forward 10 minutes later, we had ordered our food to a robot of a waitress, honestly it was like us not ordering drinks just sucked all the life out of her completely. it took about 15 minutes for our app's to come, once we were finished it took 20+ minutes for our mains to come...after finishing our app's? unacceptable on so many levels, to further the level of frustration even more, this waitress was serving all of the tables in my view, at the time there was 3 other tables that were sat within minutes of our initial sitting, given drinks, app's and even there mains, before we got ours. it felt like this waitress was playing favorites, even worse was the fact that our app's and our mains were brought to our table...by someone other then our waitress...? now if you've read this far down, surely we can agree that this doesn't make any sense. our food was very small in portion size, which was very frustrating when it came to the price of the items on the menu. ah the duck poutine, the absolute gem of the night, the reason why I wanted to come here in the first place...oh wait...its nothing special. lack of sauce, the sauce tastes like its packaged from a store, and the actual meat was very small in size. by the time the end of the meal was near, I was at my boiling point, having dealt with this table is an awkward spot of the restaurant, with people being completely inebriated bumping into my arm, while im trying to celebrate and/or eat. the washroom is also super tiny, and the faucets are broken? I quickly got ahold of the waiter after coming back up, who brought our food, not the original waitress, paid, was brought an ipad mini to fill out a survey, which I wanted nothing to do with, from the germ factor alone, we got out as soon as we could. no thank you from anyone, no have a good night, no thank you...nothing. \nThe ambience is a really nice touch to this place, but the service is some of the worst I have received. \nthis restaurant has the motto of eat well...speak easy, this restaurant doesn't deliver on either, as it will eat a hole in you're money. and its impossible to speak easy with the music cranked up as high as it is.\navoid this place at all cost. over priced, under flavored, horrible service.", 1], ["Facility: Located on Queen, just east of the 404.

Loaded up Yelp and Prohibition was the closest to parking with 4/5 average ratings. I would say the mark is true to experience.\n\nFood Quality & Price: Husband had the philly cheese steak sandwich and LOVED it. They placed a Gator sauce on the table to compliment the meal. All condiments are sold at Prohibition too. So my husband picked up a bottle to go ($12). I ordered the halibut taco which was okay (3/5), next time I'll probably get a side order of mac & cheese instead. Each dish ranges from $10 - $30 (with entrees on the latter side of that scale). But sides seem pretty hefty in size. We both really enjoyed the DF (duck fat) fries and Sweet Potato fries. We made it at the end of Hooch hour and got some beers for $5 each. The cider was delicious!\n\nService: Was friendly and attentive. Exactly what you'd expect but nothing above and beyond.  \n\nOverall: We were really glad we picked Prohibition Gastropub for dinner. I would return if I'm in the area. There were a few annoying flies in the joint during dinner, but that's probably because the doors were left open. If you're headed to an event at the Opera House, Prohibition is a 2 minute walk from there and a safe choice to pick from.

Doesn't brake the bank and will leave you full upon leaving the venue. We decided to be adventurous and tried their oysters. They were around $3.25 - $4.00 each. Can't recall the last time I tried oysters, but it was an interesting experience. I liked the East Coast oysters, while the West Coast oysters were small and didn't taste as well as the East Coast ones. Their pulled duck fries with gravy and cheese would nicely complement an main (e.g. chicken, stake, etc.) and you can share them, because even the medium portion is good for 2 people.

Three pieces of kalbi came out on a sizziling plate and I was consumed by the smoke. The ribs ended up a little dry since I couldn't see my plate and all I could taste was burned/burnt soy sauce. Not a great marinade for the ribs. \n\nThe shrimp tosada was a bit better. Refreshing shrimp and avocado topped on a fried...thing, I guess. It was difficult to share and eat, but it was good. \n\nFor the mains, I got the halibut tacos and my fiance ordered the ribs. I enjoyed the tacos but I found them a bit small. I was quite hungry afterwards, but I think if the tacos came with a side, say fries, I would be fine. I'm not much a rib person, but my fiance liked them. He got 6 ribs where the table near us only got 4 ribs. The cheddar biscuit and coleslaw were really good. \n\nWhat disappointed me the most was the dessert. I was so looking forward to my New Yorker Chipwich and the Brownie Sundae but none of them really delivered. I assumed the cookie part of my chipwich would be warm, but both cookies were cold, hard and the ice cream just made them colder and harder. \n\nThe brownie sundae consisted of a two bite brownie at the bottom, ice cream and whipped cream. A good combination but one you can make at home. \n\nThat's all. I don't know. Maybe they didn't impress me solely on their Summerlicious menu.

It was very clean and well stocked.", 5], ["I had heard good stuff about this place but to be honest it didn't meet my expectations.

The desert was the saving grace.\nNot worth the money you spend definitely!", 3], ["FOOD: \nPizzette ($11.00)\nThe pizza was topped with fresh tomatoes and cheese.

The Rigatoni was amazing as the pasta had a very good texture. The Parmesan cheese really helped enhanced the flavour of this dish. \n\nGnocchi Gorgonzola ($12.00)\nThe gnocchi was creamy and melted in your mouth. Hearty and satisfying.", 4], ["Awesome place!\n\nIf you want good food you need to try this place!\n\n We came here with 15 people for some late night drinks and appetizers. \nFirst time coming here and I can guarantee i will  be back. \n\nThey had 7 different appetizers and all were really good but 2 of them were outstanding. \nThe bbq shrimp was really good but the mini burgers were just out of this world. It was so juicy and the tasty. \nThere was polenta with some goat cheese and gnocchi with a gorgonzola sauce. \n\nGreat job to the whole staff and especially the chef. \nBravo!", 5], ["Tried for first time last night for Valentines. Great staff. Nice lighting / atmosphere. Beef Carpaccio and Gnocchi were to die for! Absolutely delicious.

Nice little gem and reasonably priced.", 4], ["Five Doors North is a gem and the food is amazing!  Service is always great especially if you are lucky enough to get James as your server the night will be perfect. \nDefinitely try the sausage appetizer dish in a mushroom sauce (my husband's favourite) which I am told is almost like a dessert. \nMy go to is the avocado served with grilled bread and the ribs....oh the ribs!!  \nGreat wine selection too!", 5], ["First time coming here.

The server that I had has a very good sense of humor.  \n\nI must also mention about the mirror in the guys washroom. It's like a large TV for ads.  Pretty impressive.\n\nFood wise, the food doesn't come with any sides, so you will have to order the sides as well if you want things such as potato or veg or etc .   I have the rib eye.  It tasted really WOW.  For the price, I would say it's very amazing.  (Though the higher end steaks from Costco would taste just as good).\n\nThe appetizer was also very good.  We went as a group so we tried a bunch of them.  The salmon one I liked the best.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place if you've never tried it.", 5], ["Nice Italian-modern restaurant.

The Avocado Bruschetta is absolutely a must try, as is anything on the menu involving fish or their game meats (Elk, Venison, Bison). \n\nThe service is on point and the atmosphere, while loud at times, is warm and welcoming no matter the season.

It's a cute starter but it lacks in flavour concerning everything.\n\nBaked Goat Cheese Polenta w/ Sundried Tomato Paste & Pesto (3.5/5)\nThere was a tiny, tiny, tiny teaspoon of tomato paste in the middle ontop of the polenta under the pesto which was a bit disappointing. The pesto was nice and herbaceous and I loved the salad underneath to help complement the polenta. I don't recall any strong goat cheese flavour and this dish was very filling for an appetizer.\n\n1.50$ Bread (5/5)\nThe bread was fucking amazing. The crust was so crispy and fragrant with herbs and cheese and the bread was so soft and delicate homg. droolzzz\n\nBraised Boneless Beef Short Rib w/ Root Veg & Navy Beans (3/5)\nMaybe I didnt have enough of it to judge it as I only had a bite? But it was pretty decent; the beef was cooked perfectly to be honest with you and the flavour of the sauce and the vegetables together made it a really nice hearty, earthy dish but I don't think I could finish this as it would get too boring for me.\n\nPumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon w/ Mango & Smoked Red Pepper Salad (4.5/5)\nThis was the best flavour trip I've went on for an itallian restaurant. The contrasting textures of the crunchy seeds, crispy yet chewy skin, flaky but moist salmon, slightly crunchy mangoes, soft red peppers. It was a thrill eating this. The flavours of all the components complimented each other ALOT and I would I highly recomend this dish to anyone to try. The only reason why I knocked half a star was because there was a minimal amount of red pepper salad when there could've been more because I didn't notice any red pepper until halfway into eating the salmon that I noticed it.\n\nWarm Banana Chocolate Pudding (4/5)\nI really liked this and I wish it was hotter and I wish I knew what that white sauce was, it was such good comfort food as a dessert.\n\nFlourless Chocolate Cake (5/5)\nMe and my friend loved this cake it was so moist yet so fluffy, melt in the mouth even and the blueberry reduction made it perfect!

We ended up parking 3 blocks away and it took us 20 minutes to find that spot. Gotta love Toronto.\n\nThe restaurant is small but we didn't feel cramped at all. The server was super nice and helpful with his enthusiastic recitation of the specials. DW went with the salmon which was tender, flaky, moist, and quite delicious.

We were shown to a sweet table right by the window and instantly served glasses of water and complimentary bread. Good start so far.\n\nFor our appetizer, we decided to share an order of the Prosciutto Rolls (\"w/arugula, goat cheese, and figs\").

I really, really enjoyed this. The steak was cooked perfectly (despite the cut being a little on the chewy side), and the accompanying onions-and-gorgonzola sauce was just about perfect. I also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts and Bacon, and they were fine. (The brussels sprouts were a little underdone, but when eaten with the aforementioned sauce, they were quite tasty.\n\nI should also mention that my dining companion ordered the famous BBQ Baby Back Ribs (\"w/matchstick potatoes\") and they were as phenomenal as you'd expect.

Our server was very accommodating (and also had a good sense of humour) and suggested modifications to the specials.  I liked that for the three pasta specials (I think they have three pasta specials every day) that there is a small size for $12 or a large size for $20, which allowed me to enjoy both a starter and small pasta.  I ordered the beet soup and gnocchi with tomato sauce.  I wouldn't order the soup again having found the flavour a bit bland (I also omitted the sour cream) but with some dipped bread, it satisfied my craving for a warm dish.  The gnocchi was unreal.  I loved that it was served in a pan and the gnocchi pieces themselves were huge and there was lots of extra sauce.

Till this day, it is still the best steak I have ever had.  It was tender, juicy, and grilled to perfection; it always melted just sitting in my mouth.  My only complaint of course, is that it was only 6 oz  =).  Mysteriously, they stopped serving the same steak for their Winterlicious events after.  Their creme brulee was also something to write home about.  It was my first time trying creme brulee, I'm not dessert fan, but boy was it good.  One of the best creme brulee I have had since then.

For all its pretentions, the chefs had a very heavy hand with the salt and olive oil, the meat and fish were overcooked, the wine was merely meh, and our server was a strange blend of condescending and confused.  It is head and shoulders above most places in the area, but that doesn't count for much -- it is still not where it ought to be.", 3], ["A very good restaurant with reasonable prices.

There isn't an iota of a wow factor in this resto whatsoever.  Frankly I found it to be kinda grungy.  My arms kept sliding on the clear plastic covers tacked on to the tables.  This spot looks like a cheap restaurant makeover place.  Even the glassware is kinda grungy.  You know how glasses get to look after they been through the industrial dishwashers one too many times.  This is totally Five Doors North which made me wish I should have gone a few doors further north and hit up Zucca instead.  \n\nHooked up with my sista meatatarian, the groovy Shari M. and we were hunkering down for a celebrataory birthday evening and thought this place would hit the spot, especially after reading the glowing reviews.  We ordered some plates to share.  Grilled sardines.  Pizzetta.  Sausages.  Some rolled up prosciutto thing that they brought literally seconds after ordering.  They must make them in advance and keep them in the fridge.  This meant the prosciutto was really well chilled which ultimately means you just can't taste it and it raised the chewy factor even more so.  \n\nShari ordered a Cosmo and her reaction was to tell me not to order my usual Cosmo cocktail because she could tell by the taste they were using really cheap booze.  Cocktails and wine by the glass is on par with restos such as the Hoof, Splendido, Enoteca....yet were miles apart in terms of quality, quantity and stemware.

We've been here a couple of times for dinner and we've never been disappointed. We love everything from the appetizers to mains and sides, and dessert! Service is always warm and pleasant. It takes a while to get your order, but I like it that way because that means food is being cooked fresh and not just being reheated or made out of a can. I love the bread they serve while you wait, which you can dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I like the handwritten menu which gives it a personal touch, and the simple decors and little lights on the table which render a rustic yet romantic feel.", 5], ["Great food, friendly stuff. we had Grilled lamb chops and it was really amazing.

Since there was a large party, we started with a series of appetizers.  We sampled the roast beet salad, goat cheese polenta, guacamole on crosontini, and grilled sardines.  The polenta was by far the most memorable of the appetizers; it had an almost whipped texture, which melted in your mouth with every bite.  I don't normally enjoy polenta, but this was by far my favorite appetizer (but the others were excellent as well).  \n\nFor my entree, I chose gorgonzola gnocchi, which was one of the day's specials.  The serving size for their single serving pastas may appear tiny, but it was so rich that I was grateful for the small dish.  I couldn't finish my dinner, even after sharing bites around the table.\n\nWe also shared a few deserts: a flourless chocolate cake, a fruit and whipped cream parfait, and a creme brule.

And finally the dessert came around, although typically not the best part of the meal for me, the desserts that evening took the cake. Amazing creme brule (definitely the best I've has in North Toronto), a flour less chocolate cake, and a cheese cake topped with a blackberry red wine reduction...my god, I had no idea red wine and cheese cake was such an amazing pairing. \n\nGive it a shot.

What irks me is that they only give you a couple of slices of vegetables with it, but I can overlook. \n\nThe sandwich I ordered was pretty hard to eat since it was really big. I recommend trying to cut it into smaller portions to help. Personally, it got a bit messy to eat so I just ate it deconstructed. The filling was also pretty salty for my taste.

The fries also felt like they were old or left out for a while, as they weren't particularly warm and had that \"next day fries\" sort of texture. On the other hand, the unchicken was quite nice! If you are a fan of tofu, like me, then you will enjoy it. It's a lightly battered piece of tofu with good seasoning. If you aren't a tofu person, perhaps stay away from the unchicken--it's quite tofu-like. \nThe omelet was, of course, not actually egg and had a tofu-like taste. Unfortunately, it felt very bland. The mushroom filling was nice but the omelet itself felt a little sad. The salad and guacamole was...well it was salad and guacamole, not much needs to be said.\n\nPerhaps it was the dishes we ordered, but this place sort of disappointed me as a vegan restaurant. I'm not vegan, but I sort of expected tastier food? Also, I feel like the cheese substitute they used did not sit well with me, so I'll have to give this place a pass on a second go.", 2], ["Amazing food and service. Went at 12:30pm on a Friday and it was such a wonderful pick me up! The food was delicious, well seasoned, and just overall exceptional. The fried banana split (not pictured)was amazinggggg! I have no complaints! It is also really decently priced. Split  2 mains, an appetizer, and a dessert and it came out to $25.99. Would definitely return.", 5], ["I didn't know what to expect, such an unusual name, but worth checking out just to say you did. I got a reuben (overcooked) & poutine (cause I am in Canada & that's their thing, right?) Well come hungry because this is a substantial amount of food you get. This is straight up comfort food & there is really nothing healthy on the menu. There are things on the menu that you probably can't find anywhere else so you might as well go for it.", 4], ["One of my closest friends recently became a vegan, and while I'm not vegan, I am happy to dine in a vegan restaurant whenever I spend time with her. She lives in BC right now, but was in town for a short visit this past weekend. I had made a note of some vegan spots to take her to, and she was super excited about this one in particular. \n\nWe decided to get a few different items to share so that we could try more items. I don't have much experience with vegan substitutes like \"cheese\" or \"chicken\", so I cannot compare with anything. However, I know what I like and what tastes good to me, vegan or not. \n\nWe started with the fried shiitake mushrooms and a side of mac & cheese. The mushrooms were delicious. In fact, we were tempted to get a second order, but we refrained because we wanted to try more items. \n\nThe mac & \"cheese\" was good, but the flavour of the vegan cheese was a bit strange for me. My friend said that when you stop eating regular cheese, the vegan stuff starts to taste better after a while. I didn't dislike it, it was just different. \n\nWe also got the unchicken & waffles and the southern combo to share. We both absolutely loved the collard greens, definitely up there among the best I've had. She had never had them before, and was an instant fan. The unchicken was a good enough substitute that she commented that if it wasn't for the fact that she knew this is a vegan restaurant, she'd have questioned if it was actually chicken. The waffles (for me) were way too sweet, as the kitchen had already doused them in syrup. I tend not to use much syrup, if at all, so I did not enjoy them. The use of cinnamon seemed to heighten the sweetness level, so after one or two bites, I was done. My friend enjoyed them, so it's just a personal preference. I did mention to the server that it would be nice if the syrup was on the side, and she said she would let the kitchen know about the feedback. It seems the syrup is sometimes on the side, sometimes not, depends on who's cooking that day. The sweet potatoes also were a bit too sweet for me, but I left them mostly because I was full at that point. \n\nAll things considered, it was a good meal. I'm happy to see more vegan places popping up, as it's sometimes difficult finding vegan options for my friend in some of my favorite restaurants. I'll probably return here the next time she's in town, or even sooner for those mushrooms!", 4], ["It was my first time here and it was way better than I expected! My boyfriend and I dined on a Saturday evening around 7pm and it wasn't all that busy. \nWe ordered the buffalo wings (5 pieces), nachos, the southern combo and deep friend cookie dough to share. They were all amazing, our favourite were the buffalo wings. I really enjoyed the Mac and cheese too, I couldn't even tell it wasn't real cheese. The portions for the mains like the southern combo and Mac and cheese on its own are pretty large, we definitely recommend ordering different plates to share so you can try all the populars. The fried cookie dough was really good too! I think the ice cream was coconut flavour but it tasted amazing. We were super full and satisfied after all that food. We both recommend this place and we're not even vegans!", 5], ["Okay, so being a native of Austin, TX, a city with lots of vegan food and vegan food done well, you know I couldn't help but be a little skeptical of a place in downtown Toronto claiming to have vegan Southern food. I went into the restaurant with high hopes and low expectations but let me tell you, the food at Hogtown Vegan FAR surpassed anything I could have even DREAMED of!\n\nStarted off with the nachos and to this day, still the best nachos (vegan or non-vegan) I've had in Canada. The spices were spot-on and reminded me of the flavors I'd have back in Texas, and the \"cheese\" was nice, melty, and saucy! Maybe I haven't gone to the right places in Canada, but all the nachos I've had at other restaurants didn't have an actual cheese sauce and so I was ECSTATIC to see that Hogtown Vegan are doing nachos the RIGHT way!!\n\nI got the southern combo and it was absolutely AMAZING!! The tofu nuggets were good, but the stars of the show were definitely the mac and cheese and collard greens. I am a HUGE mac and cheese girl and I just couldn't get enough!! It was creamy, the pasta was nice and al dente, and if I remember correctly, there was a nice and subtle heat/spice to it! The collard greens STILL blow my mind when I think about them. Traditionally, collard greens are made with ham hocks but somehow, the greens at Hogtown Vegan still manage to have all that salty and smoky goodness. Truly impeccable and I demolished the entire plate. I still have dreams about that meal and if I ever find myself in the downtown area again, I know I'll have to stop by!", 5], ["The food and service here are beyond good -- my favourite vegan spot in the neighbourhood!", 5], ["I was very grateful to be served a bottle of as I sat down.

Best vegan restaurant! M brought me here as a surprise and it was honestly the best surprise ever!! I have never been more impressed with the choices and the flavours of the food. At restaurants, choices are limited being a vegan...but here...all the choices were an option! We ordered the shiitake fried \"clams\" the hogtown burger that reminded me of a Big Mac and we upgraded to a side of Mac and cheese! Both M and I were thoroughly impressed with everything and we genuinely had a great time. \nCan't wait to come back!", 5], ["There's a lot of comfort-style vegan food joints in Toronto, but in my opinion, this was one of the better options. Conveniently located on College near Kensington Market, Hogtown provided a delightful lunch with friendly staff.\n\nWhen my partner and I were there, we opted for the Caesar wrap with home fries and the mac and cheese as a starter. For the latter, these were definitely some of the best I've had anywhere, but certainly the best in Toronto. The cheesiness was just right and the sauce wasn't too thin or too thick. As for the Caesar wrap, it was a good size to share (they even split up for us without asking) and was a good balance of veggies and protein (I think they used tofu chunks of some kind). I believe there are a few side options to choose from, but I was glad that the potato-y option was home fries and not just straight up fries. I have nothing against fries (in general), but was craving something a little different than the shoe string variety, which was prominent elsewhere.\n\nLike basically everywhere else we went, the beer selection proudly represented local (Ontario) breweries and the IPA I got was quite excellent. And if you're interested in record shopping, take note that there a lot of great stores all nearby on College (the closest being She said boom!)", 4], ["Discovered this spot this weekend and we would definitely come back. It has a diner feel and decoration, friendly staff and amazing ice cream. I got the classic chocolate, it was rich and not too sweet. We also go a malt milkshake with peanutbutter ice cream.

Would recommend it if you are in the hood!", 5], ["[ Excellent cookies and service in an old school atmosphere ]\n\nWas almost ending a phone call so walked in to survey the goods with my eye on an ice cream sandwich. The call kept going and it wasn't busy so I stayed inside and mimed that I was sorry with the server miming back to take my time. Eventually got to ordering a chocolate chunk and Skor (two different cookies) and mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.\n\nThe cookies were fantastic - not too soft, not too hard - just right and with a malted, homemade taste that had a nice crumble to them. The ice cream was good, but I was expecting and hoping for a white-colored mint ice cream. Not cause I'm racist, but cause it's more natural and old school which would have went perfectly with the decor.

This weathered malt shop is free of pretense and full of heart.  The small chocolate malt they made for me with great care sent me whizzing back to my childhood without the need of  a flux capacitor. The texture.  The blending.  The chocolate arterial spray on the inside of the glass.

Oh boy. Okay so they had pie flavoured milkshakes with tiny pies on top! My boyfriend got their Blueberry Pie Milkshake and was blown away! I had their dairy free strawberry shake and I thought I would have to forgo the whipped cream to make it dairy free; NOPE! They topped mine with coconut whipped cream, sprinkles and a cherry on top!

I actually got the last pie and the last bit of ice cream for the milkshake so I consider myself lucky to get the populars. Friends got banana boar and strawberry milkshake. Apple pie pocket to share for the table. We all liked our drink. Rich and creamy. Loved the crust of the apple pie pocket.

I personally like wooden booths(?).\n\nAnyways, I'd love to come back for more of their other rice bowls that seem ok priced and try more :) See you guys again!", 3], ["Menu is a nice change from the usual breakfast fare, with Japanese options.  Decent cup of coffee.  I ordered the Nassau breakfast (eggs, sausage, fries and toast with salad??) I came here to grab breakfast and work, and this checked the boxes.  Free wifi (it cuts off every half an hour though and you have to log in again) and a nice view of Kensington Market. \n\nService is really subpar.  When I walk into a cafe that's empty and the person behind the bar looks up, sees you, looks down and then completely ignores you until you say, \"Hi, good morning.\", that should've been a warning sign, especially since the food has to be ordered at the counter anyway!  I feel like the place is managed by students (nothing wrong with that) who haven't been trained and have no idea of how to interact with customers.  When I made my order he did not once even look at me, and didn't even ask if I wanted a drink or coffee, just blurted the total immediately.  I asked to add coffee and he said, \"yeah yeah yeah\" and when I specified that I wanted scrambled eggs, again with the \"yeah yeah yeah\". Again, not once was eye contact made. It looked like maybe he was looking down at his phone. \n\nThe experience isn't going to stop me from coming again to give it another shot since I live down the road and it's convenient, and the food is so-so (coffee is OK).  However, I think this place could do so much better with just a little bit of customer service training and service team that actually engaged.", 3], ["This is a very very hard review to write. I have been here three times and I finally decided to write this review. \n\nThe first time I went here, I went up to the counter and ordered the karaage don. It said three pieces of chicken but they were huge and the set was delicious. I didn't check the bill when I was paying. \n\nThe second time I went there, I got the wakayama breakfast. Like the first time, I got a table, went up to the counter to order, and someone brought my food over. This time, when I was ordering, the staff told me that there would be a 10% service charge to dine in. It wasn't on my card machine; it was added by default as a part of the bill. She asked me if \"it was okay\", and I told her that I would prefer to pay after my meal, since tipping, to me at all other restaurants I've been to, is only necessary when someone comes to take my order. My bigger issue was that it should be *my* option to choose how much, or whether, I want to tip, not the staff member's. She didn't really say anything and looked quite troubled so I told her I was okay to pay the service charge. The food was delicious and I enjoyed it throughly. \n\nToday, I went again, but instead, I ordered ahead through ritual. I thought, if I order ahead, get the food from the counter and clean up after I'm done, I wouldn't need to be served and thus wouldn't be required to pay the service charge, right? I got the food from the counter and grabbed an empty seat and opened my takeout box. A server immediately came up to me and told me that I couldn't eat there. I thought someone had reserved the seat, so I asked why. She told me that I couldn't eat takeout orders in the store and I had to leave. I was in shock; it was a self-serve restaurant and it was really empty. Why wasn't I allowed to eat there? She was super hostile towards me as well, making me extremely uncomfortable, especially since I started to eat already. \n\nUnfortunately, I won't be coming back until the service charge becomes an option for customers, instead of being a forced charge. It is such a shame since the food is absolutely delightful.", 1], ["We're very glad that we found Adega while in Toronto. We followed the recommendations offered on Yelp and we weren't disappointed. My exposure to Spanish/Portuguese food is pretty much limped to restaurants in the Newark, NJ area. What a great choice this turned out to be! Had the following dishes, plus a few others that were specials for that evening.\n\nGRILLED SQUID\n13.00 \nin a lemon, coriander & garlic olive oil sauce\n\nCATAPLANA FRESH FISH STEW\n27.00 \nBouillabaisse of mussels, shrimp, clams, squid, fresh fish & tomato broth\n\nHigh marks for the atmosphere, the food, and the service. All were impeccable!", 5], ["Overall - 4 stars-ish\nFood only - 3 stars-ish\n\nIf the above sounds indecisive, it is because I am not experience in Portuguese food.  The overall high rating reflects my opinion on the combined offering of food, services, venue and quality.\n\nOur party of 4 came to Adega for a birthday celebration based on the recommendation of a fellow Yelper.  I found the decor and ambiance casual-classy, intimate and welcoming.  We shared an appetizer platter and a bottle of wine per the recommendation of our server.  Great recommendations!  The app platter was a crowd pleaser; we loved the variety.  The wine was really good for the price (less than $50).  Two of us ordered the octopus entrees, one ordered a cod entree while another ordered a fish stew entree. My grilled octopus tentacle was tender on the thicker end but quite tough on the thin end.  I supposed the unevenness was hard to avoid given the big difference in radius of the tentacle.  My friend said his cod fish fillet was fresh, juicy and cooked just right.  The other said the fish stew was big portioned and delicious as well.  At this point, I might remind that there was an appetizer platter, 4 seafood entrees, one bottle of wine, plus 2 desserts on the bill.  We were expecting a hefty bill.  Nope; the total came to $300 tax in.  What a high value place.  I literally checked the bill to confirm nothing was missed.  Nada!  With good moods and spare changes, we gladly tipped our server generously.\n\nOur little group haven't dined in downtown Toronto for a long time, because of costs and distance.  We would travel to Vaughan or Etobicoke, but not downtown.  This little delightful and relatively affordable restaurant has restored our interest, or may I say hope, to enjoy dinner gathering in downtown Toronto again.", 4], ["Portugal, like certain Italian & Greek cities, are well-known for their seafood, so my expectations coming into Adega were relatively high. This was especially so as their prices are a good 15% higher than a comparable Italian restaurant.\n\nSo, how did it go?\n\n1) The hits: \n- Grilled sardines were good. The sardines were nicely charred, the grill marks on the skin were intact and the presentation was appealing. \n- The seafood risotto was flavourful. Very generous portion, with decent pieces of fish, prawns and squid. I thought it could do with a tad more stock, but overall, no issue with the dish.\n- The grilled octopus was well done - very tender, yet cooked through just right. If anything, it was a bit on the salty side, but again, no big issue here.\n\n2) The misses:\n- We had 2 soups. Neither impressed. The prawn bisque was too thin to really be labeled a bisque, and it lacked salt. The daily soup, which was supposed to be yam and carrots, tasted like carrot juice, and was not properly strained, so there were strings of vegetables floating around. (To the restaurant's credit, they informed the chef & did not charge me for it).\n\nOverall, the food wasn't too shabby, but I found the prices a little too high to justify. Being located in the downtown core, you're pretty much paying a premium for the location.", 3], ["Mmmm I love it when Summerlicious comes around! My friends and I came here to try Adega - not realizing how fancy and intimate of a place it is, a couple of my friends wore t-shirts and felt very underdressed and out of place. The service is good, but I found it slightly pushy - we were asked on multiple occasions whether we'd like wine, sparkling water, etc.\n\nEach table has unlimited bread and olives as appetizers to share. The bread I found a bit dry, while the olives were overly salty. That said, it's a good way to fill up if you're starving!\n\nI ordered the grilled sardines as an app (the waiter said it's a must-order if you love fish), grilled squid as a main, and three flavours of sorbet as dessert.\n\nThe grilled sardines were pretty good - it was a large plate with 3-4 fillets. The sardines are grilled and then dressed with a citrusy tomato sauce, and served with some sweet pineapple chunks as well. It's a good dish, but not really my preference.\n\nThe grilled squid is fairly small as a main. There are two squid bodies that are grilled in olive oil, and presented alongside small carrot cubes, a small potato, and some withered pea shoots. It's a light meal, but quite good.\n\nThe sorbets were served in a small bowl, but with an awfully large spoon! They really should invest in smaller non-soup spoons. The flavours were mango, berry, and some sort of guava mixture. \n\nOverall, the meal was good, but I've had better Summerlicious options at a lower price. Adega is good, but some other ones definitely rank higher on my list!", 3], ["I came here for an event, where we could order from a pre-set menu. We were in the lower level around a large table surrounded by bottles of wine and what looked like a prison cell. Service was great and the food was good as well.\n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered a caesar salad. For the entree, I ordered a salmon dish. We also each received a trio of mini desserts. The caesar salad was great. I enjoyed the thin slices of cheese and the long, thin crouton on top. I appreciated that the dressing was light. I thought the salmon dish was too salty. The excess salt kind of ruined an otherwise perfectly cooked salmon. The desserts were excellent. I enjoyed the pecan pie and the creme brulee. I love pecan pie, but I don't normally enjoy creme brulee, so I guess that says a lot.\n\nOverall, an excellent place for dinner with friends and family.", 4], ["I have been to Adega many times with my coworkers for lunch. The food never disappoints. The seafood is extremely fresh and every dish I have had so far was delicious. The grilled calamary is amazing. For the main I especially like their saffron seafood risotto. It has different types of fish, as well as calamari, shrimp, mussles, and a subtle hint of saffron which gives the dish a beautiful aroma and color. The service has always been great as well. I will be back again for sure!\n(Hint: their complimentary olives are sooo good! So is their complimentary bread!)", 5], ["I came here with my mom for winterlicious 2019. I was lucky enough to get street parking right in front of the restaurant around lunch time. Parking is $5 an hour so budget for that.\n\nThe resto looks like a converted old home and the offering is Portuguese cuisine. It is a white table cloth eatery and at the time when we went the tables were 50% full. The clientele looked like Bay Street/financial districters and retirees. \n\nYou get olives, bread and olive oil on the table pre your meal. The servers were professional and quite nice. One thing I will say however is that the portions are quite small. But not to the point where you leave dissatisfied. We got the lobster bisque and beef carpaccio to start. Both were very good, however the beef carpaccio was 4 extremely thin pieces of beef. For main we got the piri piri carpon and shrimp linguine. Both I highly recommend, even though the portions where small they were well plated. Lastly was dessert... I'm not going to lie my mom laughed when she returned from the washroom and saw our finishers. I had a Creme caramel which was just a strip of dessert. Literally just a strip. And she got an egg white puffed situation? Again, great presentation and my dessert did pack a punch but we were not impressed with hers.\n\nI paid $70 (including tip) for both of our 3 course meals. This is why I love the \"licious\" menus. Otherwise I wouldn't have eaten here!", 4], ["After having visited Elm Tree Restaurant (which is very close to Adega), my boyfriend and I decided to come to Adega as I'm a huge fan of pasta and seafood. The ambiance is very nice here with the dim, romantic lighting along with the \"rustic\" look that makes the place feel authentic. There is a really nice seating area downstairs in a wine cellar which you can book out for larger groups. The server we had was very knowledgeable of the menu and specials leaving us impressed at how he was able to memorize all the specials. \n\nI ordered the fettuccine with scallops and smoked bacon whereas my boyfriend ordered the grilled squid dish. My dish was underwhelming, at best. I would not recommend my dish. The cream sauce was very light and a bit bland. I expected the scallops to be nicely crisp and pan-fried but they tasted boiled. There was very tiny bits of bacon in it. The portion was small. The squid, however, was incredible and the saving grace. The garlic olive oil sauce was perfectly seasoned and complimented the squid wonderfully. I also liked how the dish was keto. \n\nI would certainly come here again but would opt away from ordering the fettuccine.", 3], ["Summerlicious time!!  It's on until July 22nd so don't miss it!  Came here today with friends for lunch for the Summerlicious Prix Fixe lunch menu for $28 which includes an appetizer, main and dessert.  I started with the seafood bisque, then grilled squid and finished with the sorbet dessert.  What really stood out for me was the grilled squid which was outstanding.\n\nOverall, my friends and I had a fabulous time.  I'm sure that I will be back soon.", 5], ["Finally got to visit Adega after hearing about this place for the past few years. We vsited Adega on February 1 at 12:30PM for the lunch service during Winterlicious. Unfortunately, it was a TERRIBLE experience from the start to finish. Once we got in, we were greeted by the host asking if we would like to check the jackets. We gladly did and waited to get a tag for our jackets. However, we didn't get one and was told that they don't do the tag system. What if somebody took the wrong jackets? (More on this later) Confused, we were seated to our table. Understandably, it was during lunch rush hour and during Winterlicious, but we waited a good 5 mins to be greeted by the waiter and another 5 mins to order our dishes even though we were actively looking for them.\n\nFor Starter, we got the Seafood Bisque and Beef Carpaccio. \nThe seafood bisque was bland and has almost no flavor to it. It isn't rich nor salty. I don't know, maybe it was just that day but seafood bisque was a disappointment.\nThe Beef Carpaccio is actually decent tasting! It is far from the greatest looking plate of beef and arugula, but is actually tasty.\n\nFor the Entree, we got Linguine with what's supposed to be Tiger Shrimps, and Mushroom Risotto. \nThe Shrimp Linguine was a disaster. It seems like a plate of mess that was tossed together and clearly no effort was put into the pasta. The shrimps were those chemical soaked crunchy shrimp you get from the cheap Chinese stir fry, definitely not the so-called tiger shrimps. The spaghetti is sad looking to say the least. The mushroom risotto is actually good, I enjoyed it. However, no effort in plating was shown. Like, at least put some chive or parsley on top. \n\nThe desserts we went with Creme caramel and meringue pudding. The Creme Carmel is a sad looking small side slice of Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, while others have a much generous cut of the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, we only got a small slice and was thoroughly disappointed. Taste wise it is actually pretty good! The Meringue Pudding is also great! Airy and flavorful. \n\nAfter paying for the underwhelming meal, here's comes the issue for the cost checks. It was during busy lunch rush and our jackets were put into separate piles and seemly no organization. I can just take whatever I want and nobody cares. This is just scary and uncalled for. They can definitely do better.\n\nOverall a disappointing and lackluster experience. Would not go back again.", 2], ["I came here the other day with a couple girlfriends spontaneously for a friends birthday. It was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was relatively quiet. \n\nService was amaaaazing!! As soon as they sat us down they brought us a bread basket and a plate of olives, which they kept replenishing!\n\nThey then brought us these cute little taster spoons of octopus salad from the chef. They were amazing!\n\nWe split some salads for apps that were all delicious.

My friend had the squid and said it was good \n\nI had salmon for main course which was delicious !\nAnd sorbet for dessert - also yummy !\n\nMy friend really enjoyed her linguine and creme caramel !\n\nThere was nice bread, olive oil and olives at the table \n\nThe service was leisurely. We didn't feel rushed at all and could sit enjoy our meal \n\nOverall a great dinner and would definitely go back.", 4], ["Wonderful dinner through the Winterlicious menu. Sardines were delicious (one spine missed but authentic nonetheless).  Wonderful service throughout.  I had the veal and it was really quite spectacular. \n\nNoise level was challenging with a boorish man at the next table complaining with outrageous language about his (I hope) ex-wife. I can see why she left. The dulcet tones of the English accented companion were a contrast as I waited for my colleague. \n\nThe \"booths\" offer no more private or acoustic separation from what the side by side tables would provide (which I sometimes consider when offered a table).  \n\nI would go again.", 4], ["This was my first time at this wonderful little gem on Elm!

I decided to stick with the fish theme and ordered the grilled squid!  WOW!  Is what I kept saying with every morsel!!!  Of course I had to have dessert and you can't be in a Portuguese restaurant and not have port!

And - the most important criteria - had a room that could seat 50-60 people!\n\nOur staff party was held upstairs in a their private room and bar. The space had sound equipment, a private washroom, and coat rack. In the summer - there's a balcony too.\n\nFrom scouting the location to booking; confirming reservations and the day-of event - everything went without a hitch. Manny and his staff were very helpful, and their assistance throughout was appreciated.\n\nWe had 3-course pre-fixe and each person had their choice of appetizer and mains. All the meals were prepared at time of order - so the food came out pipping hot and fresh!  But that also means there was a bit of a wait for each course to be served, but we were warned ahead of time about this - so we planned team activities throughout to keep people entertained/busy.\n\nWe did decorate the space with more festive items - nothing was allowed to stick to the walls, but we had table decorations that worked.\n\nOverall, everyone enjoyed the event - which is a tough feat to please 50+ people! So if you're looking for a venue for a company party, I'd recommend Adega.", 4], ["A very trendy restaurant tucked away on Elm Street. The interior is gorgeous and would be a nice spot for date night - or in my case, lunch with a friend! \n\nWe came for Summerlicious, and as soon as we were seated we were greeted with warm bread, olives, and infused olive oil from the get go. Olives were amazing, and they give you a very generous amount so you have plenty to snack on throughout the meal.\n\nFrom the summerlicious menu we ordered the seafood bisque (x2), the grilled squid and linguine with shrimp, and the pudding and cheesecake for dessert.\n\nThe bisque was very underwhelming. There was probably 1/3 cup served in the huge bowl they brought, and it was so thin it was almost like a murky soup. Extremely salty, and overall a disappointment. \n\nThe grilled squid was quite delicious, served with kale, potatoes, and carrots. Again, it was really salty, but the flavors worked very well together. The portion was very small - you get a tube of squid (and a few tentacles), two slices of potato, a quarter cup of cooked kale, and 4 or 5 cubes of diced carrots. Thank goodness for the bread at the table or we would have starved before reaching dessert! My friend had the linguine with tiger shrimp and it was...sad. There were two small shrimps on top of some linguine that was tossed with a tomato sauce. Portion size again very small (another shout-out to the bread). \n\nThe desserts were fine, nothing spectacular. The lemon cheesecake was a sliver of cheesecake with a few blueberries and a drizzle of sauce. My friend had the pudding it was much better. Again, nothing special.\n\nThe thing that really got to us was how rushed the service was. While our server was attentive, he was so rushed that at times our plates were practically snatched from us before we were done eating. My friend who wanted to dip her bread in the bisque had her unfinished bowl taken away while she was reaching for the bread basket, and then had to ask for it back...very awkward. \n\nI will say, however, that the servers here are very seasoned and professional. They provide good explanations of the menu and are very attentive. I believe the rush was due to the busyness of the lunch hour and summerlicious, so I will not hold it against them. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience. The grilled squid really was very good, so I likely will return again to try it on their regular menu. Hopefully the next time I come I will avoid the peak times so that I can enjoy the nice atmosphere.", 4], ["Nice spot for date night, not too stuffy not trendy good service good food and not insanely loud like some restos can get when crowded. \n\nReasonable prices for what you get I think our bill was about $100 per person for three courses plus glass of wine. \n\nWe had pork belly/octopus app (very good but a bit of an odd combo). \n\nFor mains we got the Cataplana and the seafood risotto. Both dishes were not lacking for seafood. They were very generous with the servings. Did not skimp as i noticed there were three big clams (not the baby clams you often get).  Seafood risotto was good but not great. \n\nWaiter was helpful and explained the dishes as well as the wine.  \n\nDessert was also good mango crime brulee and chocolate mousse. \n\nSolid choice.", 4], ["Came here yesterday to try the Prix Fixe menu, and it way surpassed me expectations.

He spoke with a charming accent and even offered us more bread when ours ran out (as I am a bread monster when the bread is good). There were olives (YUM) on the table as well, and olive oil for the bread. \n\nI had the squid (perfectly cooked and two big pieces, with beautifully seasoning, over a pineapple and ?cabbage? salad for brightness), the salmon (beautifully crusted and perfectly cooked to be meaty and not mealy, with a tangy complimentary pineapple compote, and perfectly season veggies below). The sorbet was very good, but a lot of sweet for one person to handle. We also got personal teas as part of the menu. \n\nAlso at the table, was the ceasar salad, which had lots of prosciutto, the chicken and the seafood stew were all delicious as well!

The fish is overcooked and they burned the best part of the fish, the fish skin, so it tasted bitter, and no sauce for the fish, which makes it dry. \n\nBut the fish is still much better than the lobster.

Bread is exotic and yummy.\nWaiter is always smiling and courteous.", 5], ["This place is always busy! Since I live very close by I have been here about three times in the past four years and they never fail to disappoint. This particular time I went here for lunch on a Thursday with a girlfriend and we both had babies (4 month and 1 month). They were busy but they gave us a table in a semi private area and were very patient with us. It took us an hour to settle down and actually place our order and not once did we feel rushed or that we were a nuisance. The restaurant is fairly small so strollers won't fit here but we had two car seats and it worked out perfectly. \n\nThe black olives here are divine! I go here just for them! Luckily the rest of the food is also amazing. This particular visit I had the chorizo potato soup of the day and the gravlux along with the apple pie and dark chocolate soufle. All dishes were fantastic, great complex flavours with Portuguese flair. \n\nIf you're ever looking for a baby friendly spot that isn't a chain restaurant this is it! Their wine list is sufficient and has some excellent finds. Mains on average were about $16 for lunch. Dessert was around $7 each and appetizers range from $7 to $15.", 4], ["Why I gave 4 stars\nService 5 stars: The staff were extremely attentive and ensured that everything was taken care of. The restaurant has great architecture and I think it is a good place to celebrate a special moment.\n\nFood    3 stars:  I loved the sorbert dessert, delicious. However, my pan seared salmon would have had perfect if it was not for the excessive salt. Looking at the previous reviews it seems that this is a recurring problem. Hopefully the chef at Adega find alternative ways to add flavour to the food without relying on salt.", 4], ["Excellent place for fine dining in a cozy atmosphere. We were wlcomed with courtesy, waiter was very friendly and described the menu with clarity; drink orders taken and delivered without delay. Menu had dishes to suit all tastes. The seafood and fish dishes are what brought us in and they did not disappoint; calamari done to a turn, tasty sardines, rich risotto and stunning fish stew. Service polite and efficient. Interesting wines by the glass at very reasonable pries. The only negative was parking experience, but it was expected on Sat night at downtown.", 5], ["One of the best 5 meals of my life.  Fantastic!  I had the grilled octopus.  The mango sorbet is the best I've had.  Service was impeccable.\n\nThank you thank you thank you.", 5], ["Adega is an impressive spot with quite decent seafood and other Portuguese specialties.  However, I think the combination of really good service and a super convenient downtown core location cause it to get a bit of ratings inflation.  I was quite surprised to see it listed as the # 1 Toronto restaurant overall in TripAdvisor.  Frankly, I don't even think it's the # 1 Portuguese seafood spot in TO.  \n\nThe food was pretty universally tasty and well prepared; the cataplana was top notch filled with high quality bits of fishy goodness, the prawns were tasty and properly cooked and seasoned beautifully.  The only dish that let me down was the octopus.  Not that it was at all bad, it's just that I had recently been able to consume some of this most delectable cephalopod at both Joso's and Chiado and they have set the bar ridiculously high for the Toronto scene. \n\nAdega seems to be a pretty regular tour stop for Mws2 (Men Who Still Wear Suits) so if you're allergic, best to steer clear.  The regular bookings of drug reps, investment bankers, and other assorted rogues do put quite a drain on the service in the place.  Eating hear when large groups are being accommodated is sure to rev the frustration engines well past the red line.  \n\nBottom line; you'll eat well at Adega and, quite surprisingly for the location, you'll do so at a fair price.  There's quite a lot to like about this restaurant, just not all that much to love.", 3], ["3/5! We heard amazing reviews about this place but we weren't that impressed. The biggest problem was that the chef was out of a lot of ingredients so 30% of the menu was not available (most of which we would have selected). We encountered a similar issue with the wine list. Of the 3 dishes we ordered, the only remarkable one was the grilled octupus. The fish stew arrived cold and the chicken risotto wasn't that great (granted we should have ordered the seafood one instead). Overall, unlikely that we will go back.", 3], ["Adega is one of our favourites.  This is the resturant where I proposed to my future wife.  They were very accomodating for this event and were happy to provide me with a private alcove table.  They were very good with their timing and nice enough to provide us with a couple of glasses of complimentary champage a well timed minutes after the main event.\n\nThe wine list provides a nice selection of lesser known portugese varietals and our server was exceptionally knowledgeable about the characteristics of each.\n\nOur meal started with some excellent bread and some extremely addictive olives which are probably some of the best that I've ever had.\n\nWe had the Petisco Platter for our appetizer.  Everything was excellent, especially the portuguese cheese, perfectly grilled sardines and chorico.  \n\nMy Fiancee had the Mediterranean Octopus which was exceptionally tender and cooked to perfection.  I had the Cataplana Fish fish stew which was an excellent, traditional comfort food.\n\nOur night was finished off with some tasty desserts.  I had a glass of vintage white port which complimented the White Chocolate Creme Brulee rather nicely.  My fiancee had the Warm Caramelized Apple Tart with an espresso.  \n\nOverall a fantastic evening with an excellent atmosphere, great food and exceptional service.", 5], ["Feel like I'm in Istanbul again . Love their tea, Turkish coffee, the Simits are authentic and come with delicious (more North American) fillings! Shaskshouska so fragrant and piping hot. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet.

The staff are also lovely.", 5], ["To clarify - this bad review is based on the horrifying service of the employees here; not reflective of the food. It's too bad because I enjoyed my shaksuka. But I will never\n, ever come back here . \n\n\nOne employee brought over the shaksuka meal on the wooden tray with a very hot cast iron and decided to placed it on the very edge of the small table outside and obviously due to its size it would have toppled over. Instead of saying sorry, she said \"I thought you would've grabbed it\". I'm sorry? Knowing how heavy and hot this food item is, you decided to placed it on the edge of a round table and trying to blame me? So the cast iron fell and the entire thing fell on me and  my white Dior bag. Because it was so hot , it gave me a minor burn and she took my bag and decided to wash it off. The section hit by the shaksuka came out yellow. At this point, still no word of apology whatsoever. \n\nThen I came in to ask for a tissue with some dish soap to help wash off, because the stain was so obvious on my white bag and was told to just grab the tissue  from the table - I had to insist on getting a tissue with dish soap because my Dior bag is now half yellow.

I ordered the Poseidon (Turkish bagel with smoked salmon) and my partner ordered the one with prosciutto (cannot remember the name). As a huge bagel connoisseur, the bagel was a bit too chewy for the both of us. It's definitely not awful by any means but I don't think I will be returning anytime soon. The cappuccino I got was also subpar.", 3], ["How much do you expect a bagel with salmon and a coffee to cost? That's right, $23! How did you know?\n\nYeah no, this place is over-hyped and overpriced. I've tried to like it. First time I got a chai latte with some weird chai and it literally had chunks of herbal tea leaves in it. It was a feature of this herbal chai. The food that sits out doesn't look the freshest, at least the first time I went and saw it. It had meat and cheese and looked like it was sitting for a long time. \n\nThe smoked salmon bagel was average. The bagel is called simit so I guess that's why it's more expensive. To get avocado on the sandwich is an extra $3.50 and it's not even fresh, it's mush and it tastes like it may be processed. Not actual avocado pieces. About 1 tablespoon of avocado mush for $3.50 extra. \n\nOnly good thing was the Turkish coffee but it wasn't as good as I've had other places. \n\nOverall disappointing experience. It's too bad Constantinople Bakery is closed because that was the best Turkish coffee with food we had in the area.", 2], ["Such an amazing cozy spot. I went on a Saturday morning for coffee. I got the Turkish latte which was divineeee. My husband got the drip coffee and my friend got a Turkish coffee. I highly recommend the Turkish coffee latte.

Ordered the simit with various spreads (vegetarian platter) served on a wooden board. Some of the spreads are black olive, hummus, pickled veggies, and two others I could not put my finger on. I did enjoy the diversity and nutrition benefits in the spreads. The texture of the simit was browned well on the outside and chewy on the inside, I would have wished for it to be softer. I opted for masala tea, did not dazzle me as much, should have went full out with the masala chai.\n\nService & atmosphere: The staff are knowledgeable of the menu items and patient to new customers. The interior is modern rustic, a nice place to have a coffee chat, work or study!\n\nPrice: Seems high as the prices are a reflection of the neighbourhood and location being near downtown.", 3], ["Lemme give the restaurant some props for giving me some nice looking bagels and a fancy marble table - was able to get a super cute Insta pic.\n\nOnto the food... You won't find a bigger smoked salmon bagel fan than me but I was underwhelmed by the Poseidon bagel.

Seriously ???\n\nIt tastes ok, but the originals back home are bigger, better and cheaper.  I am allergic to coffee so no tea or latte for me. There's no such thing as Turkish latte in Turkey, only Turkish coffee (thick, unfiltered ).

The Simit is a Turkish bagel and I have loved it ever since I've tried it! I've ordered the pro and the turkey since I've got here and it took me a while to figure out what about this food made it just so tasty! I probably would never eat aged cheddar by itself but paired in these dishes it makes the perfect companion to the other ingredients. Relatively inexpensive (about $10-$16 CAD or $8-$14 USD).\n\nThe baklava is also very tasty! They use a relatively thin syrup which I like! They also have a good few other pastries I haven't tried yet.\n\nI wish I could better describe the absolutely delicious Simit and the wonderful service but I think you'll have to check for yourself! Very relaxed, authentic, Simit shop with good lattes, coffee, tea, food, and service!", 5], ["I was super excited to try Simit & Chai and finally got around to it over the weekend. As much as I enjoyed my order, I am giving it a lower rating because I didn't feel one of the items on my bill was worth the cost. \n\nI ordered a Turkish latte with almond milk ($1 for almond milk) and a bagel with a bit of butter on the side. The latte was milky and warm - your usual tasty latte. The bagel was freshly made and you could taste it. For a plain bagel it was $3, which I don't mind spending once in a while for something freshly made. There are options to get it dressed with additional toppings for $6-9 more but that much more for simple ingredients... I figured I'd just get butter because at the end of the day, I'm there for the bagel and it's original flavour. If you think like me, don't get the butter unless you'll don't mind paying $1 for it. A ridiculous price for small containers of butter you get free at Tim Hortons. But if you're willing to pay that, I highly recommend you go all the way and get a fancy bagel. They all looked really good and very insta-worthy.", 3], ["Come for the Simits, stay for the Chai. At Simit & Chai, you will be saying Chaiyaiyai. All kidding aside, S&C is excellent and I honestly believe that they make the best bagels in Toronto.\n\nHighly recommend their Turkish Coffee and the Poseidon which has cream cheese, smoke salmon and arugula.", 5], ["There isn't a lot of seating inside, but if you can get a spot, you're golden. They've got a great selection of coffee beverages, but their bakery selection really stands out.

It was interesting to try a new food that I am unfamiliar with, however I was let down. The simits. Essentially firm, less doughy bagels, were interesting to try but just weren't very enjoyable. Very dry, compounded by the generally dry topping offerings.", 2], ["Ok pork is legal in Turkey and you can find it in touristy areas, I was told it wasn't. However, it's still not consumed with smit and most people don't eat it. Rest of my review still stands. \n\n---------------------------------------------------\nLet's start with the good. Simit itself(bagel) was very good, toasty and with a strong taste. However, if you're going to serve Simit, at least have the traditional toppings offered with Simit. Majority of the Simit was served sort of pork, even the turkey topping is an addition. Fyi, Pork is illegal in turkey and they have historically never bred pigs.\n\nNext issue is price, $14 dollars for a bagel with cold turkey slices? This is the cheapest street food in turkey.\n\nNice vibe and all, just make an educated decision that you're paying $$ for a glorified bagel with western toppings which has nothing to do with authentic simits.", 2], ["Came here on two separate occasions for a light lunch. Tried the Shakshuka the first time, which is served in a hot pan with tomato sauce and poached eggs with simit on the side for dipping. It was decent but I found the spice/ herb taste a bit strong. The second time, I decided to try their simit bagel sandwich and loved it! I got the Poseidon which has cream cheese, smoke salmon and I think arugula? The sesame aroma from the sesame simit really made it stand out from a regular bagel sandwich. The only thing I took off a star for was the price, it's a bit on the pricey side for a bagel sandwich.", 4], ["After reading the super positive reviews of Simit & Chai, I was looking forward to coming here and purposely went out of my way to try their chai.  I'm not sure what happened or even if the people changed.  It seems like Lisa S also tried within 2 weeks and experienced a disappointment as well.\n\nI love Chai ... ever since my discovery of them in New Delhi and Dubai, I've been thrilled to find different variations around the world.  When Simit and Chai opened, I had it bookmarked forever.  I am never in this area of King St so I had to make the trek out.  The cafe is a decent size and has a lot of small and shared tables for you to sit.  It also have a few cute 2 seaters outside to enjoy the sun if you want.  \n\nTheir service here is polite and quiet.  They had one person taking the orders and cash while 2 others were in the back making the food.  Their menu has their bagels with various toppings, some in house baked goods, and their drink menu.  \n\nChai latte with almond milk -  When we got the cups, I was shocked at the size.  I ordered a large for $6 (with almond milk) and what arrived was a cereal bowl sized drink.  Generous ... yes perhaps but thats when I realized their mistake.  With such a large cup, you need a lot of tea to overcome the amount of water and milk in it.  This was a cup of heated diluted almond milk.  Even with the extra shakes of cinnamon, it could not change the flavour of watery milk.  What a disappointment as I was hoping for bold flavour and spices.  There was no black tea flavour or any spices.  I think I'll stick to Plentea and Chaiwalla Chai from here on in.  We only drank maybe 5 sips before giving up.  1/5\n\nTurkish cappuccino -  Another casualty of a big cup and not understanding flavours need to hold its ground to a lot of water and milk.  Similar problem to the chai latte, we got an expensive cup of super watered down coffee.  It did have a tiny bit more flavour than the chai latte but this was extremely watery.  Normally in the middle east, you can taste the cardamom in the coffee but this... I could barely even taste coffee.  I think for Middle Eastern coffee, I will go back to Souk Tabule.  There you have good flavour even if it is a latte.  Definitely too expensive for hot watery coffee.  1/5\n\nBaklava - Made in house, I was surprised when it arrived to the table.  For $2.50 the piece of baklava was only 1 inch squares.  I remember the in house made baklava at Baklava King and even then you can share the piece for maybe 2 bites each.  This single piece was a morsel.  As for flavour, you could taste the pistachios and walnuts but the syrup was not evenly distributed.  Even in the single bite I had, there was so super dried out phyllo pieces while others were properly drenched.  Good flavour but too small and not the best execution. 3/5\n\nI do have to warn people.. DO NOT USE THE BATHROOM.  It is atrocious.  I dont want to be graphic but the brown stains and terrible conditions of dirt everywhere in there was a shock.  It needs a good bleaching for a few hours.\n\nI'm not sure if they raised prices, lowered quality, or have new staff... but the Simit & Chai I experienced is not the same as others has written.  It's unfortunate but I'm hoping this is read and lessons learned to improve.", 2], ["Found this place on an instagram tag and decided to go in. Got the Poseidon (smoked salmon bagel) which was nice but not a lot of flavour. I expected more spices but it was sort of bland. \nI ordered this delicious honey cookie which was worth every penny. \nUnfortunately, ordered the masala chai which is horrible. There was no spice.  No masala. Just a latte really, loaded with more milk than necessary. For a place with \"chai\" in the name, I expect some good chai to be served. \nValue is okay for what you get, definitely on the higher side.

Their sushi rolls were terrible to say the least. The rice had little to know seasoning and the fish was not fresh. The roll was also slowly breaking apart between my chopsticks. I also wish their grilled meats station served food that was at least warm. The BBQ sausage I picked up was pretty cold. \n\nWhat was really cool was the slices of mooncake that was served in the dessert area.

Selection wise the dishes and layout are very similar to Dragon Legend (not sure if related or not). They offer peeking duck which is a great option for a buffet, as well as decent sushi, and even give you a half lobster with your meal. The rest  of the dishes are a mix of meats, veggies, and carbs, sort of like the Mandarin but less Americanized. Unfortunately, they decided to do \"holiday\" pricing for the whole month of December, hiking the price by $10 a person. Service was okay, not especially friendly but efficient at least.

All of the wood used is salvaged from sunken or wreck ships! The decor is quite epic with ships and tall, extravagant chairs. Upon entering, you see the head statues of all of the 12 Chinese Zodiacs and they have a bookmark that you can take home for each one.

All you can eat snow crab legs, Peking duck, cocktail shrimps, mussels, meats of all kind, grilled bass, basa filet, many dessert choices such as cream puffs and waffles, and sushi bar with an food attendant to serve you 3 pieces of sashimi at a time. They even had tofu pudding! I love their tofu pudding!! I did not eat their Peking duck since I am a pescatarian, but my friends were raving about it all night. I do not know anywhere else that serves AYCE Peking duck, so they definitely stand out in that regards. However, my friends and I all loved the endless amount of crab legs and we all went for like two plates each. Their fish was so moist and tasty, too! The sushi bar was bit lacking though.\n\nService: 3.5/5\n\nBesides the food attendants at each station working diligently to serve and upkeep their respective stations and food trays, the servers are not the friendliest. Maybe because of the sheer volume of the patrons, but we asked twice for plates to serve my friend's birthday cake on and in the end we had to go get them ourselves. Still, I am glad that there was no auto grab on tips and it was self-serve buffet, so I did not mind the lack of service.\n\nValue: 4.5/5\n\nThis place is PRICEY, costing $40 on a weekend night about $45 each person if you give them 10% tips. Some of my friends did not pay tips, since service was minimal and you pretty much just serve yourself. But with their wide selection of food and over the top decor, the price is justified. Many places charge about the same with much less grandiose.\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nService could have been better. There were no lobster or steak, which would have made the price more worth it. Still, I will come back on special occasions, especially for birthdays since for an entire birthday month, the birthday person can enjoy an entirely free meal if they come with 4 other paying customers and it is stackable! So you can have as many people with the same birthday month as long as there is 4 paying customers for each free meal. 2 birthday people? Then 8 paying friends out of 10 people in total and so forth. Pretty good deal. However, the fine prints states that this offer is CASH only and only works on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I think Friday is considered weekend.", 5], ["Wonderful Chinese buffet.  Along with its sister restaurant Dragon Legend in Markham, this is one of the most popular buffets in Toronto area.  I've been here many times for lunch/dinner/weekends/weekdays over the years, the food and selection is good and the staff is always friendly and fast to clean your dirty plates.  I did find Dragon Legend having a few items this place doesn't have though, like the double boiled soup and bananas  :-)\n\nDragon Pearl is less crowded compared to Dragon Legend, the seating area and decor is just beautiful (you can actually get a seat and dine on a dragon boat!)  It's in the same plaza/building attached to Galleria Supermarket (big Korean grocery store), so you can park your car and visit both places.", 5], ["I feel like 4/5 is too high but 3/5 is too low. It's so hard to rate this place. I will say Dragon Pearl is very consistent but I wouldn't eat here often because their selections don't change much from day to day. However everything is very clean. \n \nParking: there's a big parking lot but I had to park at the other end of the parking lot because all the parking spots in front of Dragon Pearl was full!\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5 it's really pretty inside. The decorations are very Asian and there's a lot of things to look at. \n\nWait time: I can't rate this but when you enter the buffet, you tell the wait staff the number of people and they'll give you a coaster shaped buzzer that buzzes  when you are the next person in line. This makes the wait feel more fair. We waited around 30 mins even though there were at least 25-30 people waiting.\n\nService: 5/5 very fast and efficient. When I raised my hand, the wait staff were very attentive. \n\nFood: 3.5/5 everything tasted OK. Nothing stood out. My last visit was last Saturday. We got these cards to redeem half a lobster tail and there wasn't much lobster meat (literally 2-3 bites) and the lobsters wasn't that fresh tasting. But then again you can't expect too much. \n\nI thought the stir fried dishes tasted the best; for example, garlic fried veggies and stir fried seafood. \n\nSelection: 4/5 they have a noodle station, BBQ station, sushi station, dessert area (with fruits), soup area, ice cream area, Dim sum area and a general area (with rice, noodles and various stir fried dishes). You can find almost everything you would expect at an Asian buffet.\n\nLunch vs Dinner: Dinner is a lot more expensive ($35.99) and the difference is that there's more seafood and Peking duck. The Peking duck doesn't compare to the ones I've had at other restaurants. If you don't like seafood, go for lunch because dinner would mean very little selections for you. Also, for dinner, you get sashimi for the sushi area. \n\nSomething cool: apparently they have a robot that cuts the noodles for the noodle soup station. You can see it as you walk into the buffet area.\n\nRecommend? I recommend everyone to come here at least once. Just for the experience. It's not a place I would go to every week but it is definitely one of the nicer Chinese buffets. You will definitely find at least something that you will enjoy at the buffet. Overall, a fun experience!", 4], ["I been to Dragon Pearl multiple times for gathering. A lot of parking outside toward the back of the plaza and easy access with only 2 min away from DVP/York Mills.\n\nVery nice decoration, wood tables and chairs. Goid variety of good from salad bar, sushi bar, BBQ Grill corner, main dishes and tradition dim sum and beiking duck. \n\nSurprise of the night was the fresh raw oysters. I believe there is a limit of 2 per person, I asked for 3 and had no problem getting it (weeknight). Many other seafood option in the main dishes too such has Crab legs, mussels, clams and shrimps. \n\nI'm not a big fans of All you can eat buffet, I always rather pay for quality than quantity, but this place has both.\n\nThe fried chicken was a disappointment, it was not crispy at all perhaps they were sitting there for too long.\n\nService was fine.

I ordered a fruit drink and it came right after.", 4], ["In my opinion, Dragon Pearl, and its sister restaurant, Dragon Legend, offers the most authentic Chinese food at a buffet restaurant in Toronto. If you've had better, please let me know where.\n\nIt's been busy every time I've been here, whether for lunch or dinner. Even with a reservation, we still had to wait. Walk-ins must get frustrated all the time. Tonight, we had a party of eighteen, celebrating my cousin's birthday. Yes, a reservation was required.\n\nDespite the many choices, I just can't resist starting with soup and salad, even just a little. I had my usual Hot and Sour Soup with a wonton thrown in. My salad included some lettuce, mango, crab, seaweed, and egg - just bites of things that I like.\n\nMy main course was the prime rib with mashed potatoes. It's not Chinese but it's what I like. I did have some Chinese food on my next plate and, of course, I couldn't miss the Peking duck, one of my all-time favourite dishes. Yummy!\n\nAlthough this is an all-you-can-eat buffet, they limit how much lobster you can have by handing out tickets when you're seated. That's odd but they've always done it this way. I'm allergic to it so it didn't bother me.\n\nThe overall food quality was very good, and consistent throughout my visits here. The servers are very attentive, refilling glasses and providing extra napkins without us having to ask.\n\nThey were also very accommodating in helping us to store and serve a birthday cake that we provided.

Comparatively for a buffet, this is really freaking often for me LOL. It satisfies my random Chinese buffet cravings. \n\nService here is probably the best of any Chinese buffet. They're always consistently clearing off your dirty plates, refilling water, and replenishing the buffet tables. We came like 10 mins before they opened and we saw them doing a lil team pow wow before service started. Pretty cute seeing a bunch of middle aged Chinese waiters chanting and cheering HAHA. \n\nFood here is average. Typical Chinese buffet stuff - noodz, fried rice, stir fry dishes, fried station, sushi, cold stuff/salads/stuff I skip, fruits, and desserts. They also have a hotpot station but, for lunch they no longer have the fresh cut noodles... it's just a choose-your-own-noodles-and-toppings noodle station.

The Peking duck is amazing here, they always give you two big pieces of duck per wrap, all the foods are yummy and the sashimi pieces tasted fresh. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place and come back once in a while when I'm craving a large selection of foods!", 4], ["Generally, I am not a fan of buffets, so take my review with a grain of salt if you are into buffets. Generally, all the food is warm, not hot, all the flavors get mixed together, and everything tastes the same. Service was good though. Drinks always there, and plates always removed. \n\nBuffet? Game plan, try a little bit of everything until you find something you like, then eat a lot of that. Did it. I tried Dim Sum, Sushi, Grilled foods, standard Chinese faire, cold foods, salads, deserts. Nothing that I could write home about enjoying here. I ended up wondering if I should go back for more, and decided that it just wasn't worth it.\n\nThe decor was ok, seemed a bit lackluster IMO, but it was ok. They tried to block out all the natural light from the windows, which I am not a fan of. I think the windows should be big and open, so people can see inside. There was a lineup at the front door, Who knows why, there was plenty of available seating in the restaurant. There is also a lot of weird objects around the restaurant. For example, when you walk in, you see the heads of the 12 zodiac symbols heads on display. It was unusual.\n\nI really tried to find some hot foods, but everything was just barely warm. I need my food hot! I ended up eating from the noodle soup station, which was disappointing as well.\n\nIn this area, there are plenty of great restaurants.

I was super stoked about that. Last year we made a special order for my dad's birthday for the restaurant to make us the 'Dragon Pearl', but I like to call it the Dragon Ball.

We where there for a birthday party (a party of 17).  We understood that the every seating is for 2 hours.  At 1.5 hours they started to request that we finish our food and leave so they can get ready for their next seating.  The restaurant at this time was 1/2 full.  10mins later while we are still eating dessert, they started to clean everything off the table.  10mins after that the manager, Sophie, came by and told us we have to leave now because the people from the next seating are there and they have to seat them.  When we left, I approached Sophie and asked why they rushed us out for a full 1/2 hour.  We understand that there is another seating and made sure we left on time but they did not have to rush us a full 1/2 hour before our seating time was over.  All Sophie had to say was that she was sorry and have a nice day.  When I tried to get a better explanation from her, she tried to pull me aside and then gave me the same reply.  \n\nWhat I have learned from this experience...\n1. This Reataurant is not looking for return customers.\n2. Do not pay the check and tip 20% till you are ready to leave... Not even if they bring the check to your table 1/2 hour before your seating time ends and insist that you settle up then.\n3. Never to return to this restaurant.  \n4.

Sure.", 4], ["We went here for Saturday dinner. It was extremely packed. We all received one voucher for lobster which was nice. Overall, the food was good. We did however notice that the staff could not keep up with the demand. Crab legs, chicken wings and pizza were among the ones that were always empty and once they did bring them out, people attacked them. The Peking duck was delicious and one of my fave dishes. Service was lacking, most likely due to the high volume of people. In comparison with Mandarin, dragon pearl did not offer better desert options, they are also not as clean as Mandarin (buffet tables and utensils were quite dirty). Prices, however were similar. I would return to give this place another chance.", 3], ["What an incredible experience at an AYCE!!!\n\nFood:  what a huge variety of appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts!  We had gone for a weenend dinner, and for about $28/person (less 20% for seniors), it was well worth it!  The buffet included a salad bar (didn't even try it), grilled pineapple, shrimp dumplings, grilled plaintain, sushi, pad thai, salmon, fish filet, mussels with black bean sauce, pepper salt shrimp, shrimp tempura, sashimi, Peking duck with lettuce and pancake wraps, BBQ spareribs, kalbi short ribs, char siu, prime rib, and lobster (each person is give one ticket for a 1/2 steamed lobster).  The dessert table included assorted cakes, cheesecakes, ice cream, creme brulee, fresh fruits, bread putting, nanaino bars, silken tofu, chocolate-dipped strawberries, puddings, waffles, almond cookies, tarts, and honey twists.  They also had their \"dragon\" noodles (served with three different soup broths) and \"dragon\" pearls, which are their specialities, as they are hand-made.  There were other things, too, which I can't remember.  Now, how in the world can you eat all this???  If I had known that they had all this, I would have starved myself all day prior to eating here.  I was just too full to try everything; next time I will know better.  Almost all the food was delicious.....until I was too stuffed to eat.\n\nA special word about their \"dragon\" noodles and \"dragon\" pearls:  this was entertaiment by itself!  It was interesting to watch the noodle maker stretch the dough and throw it up in the air and eating the freshly-made noodles.   It was also cool watching these huge round deep fried sesame balls called \"dragon\" pearls being made, which symbolize good luck; I've known them as \"jin dui\" in a smaller version.  I've never seen them sooooo huge before!  They'll break it up after it's done so that everyone can try it.  They were good, however, they were a little more crunchy than what I've been used to, but I guess it's a regional thing, i.e., adapted to the people living geographically in a specific area.\n\nDecor:  this restaurant is HUGE!!!  Interior lights are dim, which enhance all the deep red colors (Chinese love the color red for good luck) and all the petrified wood furniture throughout the restaurant.  With the high ceilings, it makes the restaurant interior look even bigger.  The heavy wooden-carved furniture was impressive!   We sat in these heavy wooden chairs with tall backs, as if we were sitting like royalty.  There are also huge red chandeliers everywhere with eye-boggling decor.  There's even wooden boat-shaped tables.  When you first enter the restaurant, there are bronze statute heads of all the Chinese astrological signs with illustrated cards describing the traits of each astrological sign that you can freely take as you please.  I overhead someone say that the restaurant won an architectural design award, which I can certainly believe.\n\nService:  despite the variety of foods on the buffet, all food items were replenished promptly.  I was impressed that there were no empty serving trays, considering the number of people that were dining there. The wait service was excellent - water glasses were constantly refilled, and empty plates were promptly taken away.  Anyone celebrating a birthday is given a cupcake with a candle on it.  At the end of the meal, each person was given a hot towel accompanied with fortune cookies.  This restaurant has its act together - service is excellent (there were 20 in our group), with many more people dining there at the same time.\n\nThis restaurant is fairly new, as it has been open only since November 2010,  For a special occasion, it's an excellent place to go to.  I can't wait to go back again, and this time, I'll be starving before I get there.", 5], ["So I went here with my parents recently for lunch on a weekday ($12.99 per person).  We got there at 11:30am, so it was initially pretty empty which was great, but as time went on it got really busy and the way the buffet is set up (you can only access food from one side and it's one continuous line instead of several \"serving islands\") meant you had to wait a while to fill up your plate.  I've been to busier buffets, but because the layout there was better, there wasn't a long wait.  So definite minus points for layout.\n\nHowever, the food was pretty good.  Better than Imperial, Starwalk and Mandarin.  Not as good as Wasabi Grand Buffet.  They had some dishes that I had not seen before at other Asian Buffets, like stir-fried ramen noodles - which were quite good actually, and stir-fried vermicelli noodles (but not Singapore Style) - which were also good.  They have a grilling section with really good grilled chicken, so tender and flavourful but not salty.  Stir-fired beef was also good and tender.  They also had large cold pre-peeled shrimp at the salad bar, and some shrimp stir-fries with sizable shrimp.  Unfortunately, their shrimp dumplings were not that good.  Too much filler, not enough shrimp.       \n\nTheir dessert section is the largest I've seen at a buffet.  They had lots of different types of cake, jello, chocolate covered marshmallows, English Trifle, this unusual but good dessert made with bananas, strawberries, walnuts and raisins in a creamy sauce, ice cream and lots of others.  They had this fried twisty thing covered in honey that is common at Chinese Bakeries.  I don't know what it's called but it is delicious.  Then of course they have the \"Dragon Pearl\" which is a giant deep fried hollow ball.  The ball is huge and you only get a piece of it (one piece per person and they dole it out to you).  In my opinion the Dragon Pearl tasted awful.  It tasted like rancid oil and didn't smell much better.  I wanted to try it for the novelty but I instantly regretted the calories!  The giant ball does look impressive though.  You can buy the whole ball for $8.99 if you wanted.\n\nThey also make hand-pulled noodles right in front of you.  They taste like udon noodles.  Nice and chewy.    \n\nThe service was excellent.  We had an older Asian man as our server and he was always smiling and so polite.  He filled our waters many times and was sure to ask us if we were enjoying everything.  He was quite possibly the nicest and most pleasant waiter I have ever seen at a buffet.  \n\nThe decor is something else.  It is so gorgeous in there.  Lots of wood everywhere and most things that are not made of wood are red (like even the dinner plates are red).  They have a \"booth\" that looks like a birdcage.  I would love to eat in there sometime.  They also have some chairs where the back is so high (like easily over 7 feet high) - probably for emperors or something like that. Definitely prettier than any other Asian buffet I've been to.        \n\nService was wonderful, decor very pretty, and food was overall good.  My only real complaint is the layout of the buffet.  I would not want to venture here on a weekend or during peak dining hours, as you could easily have to wait 15 minutes or more to line up and get your food.", 3], ["I really wanted to try this place because everyone has gone and that gigantic ball is all I can think about. In reality it is a sesame ball and it's not free lols. From what I read online, you pay an additional $10 to taste it - is someone digging for more money? Most Asian AYCE restaurants are filled with Chinese people but this place boasts some superb decor that attracts all the races. I was surprised to see so few Chinese people, except for maybe the staff haha. Anyhow, the place really brings you back to Ancient Chinese times but damn these chairs were not comfy. I mean the seating is soft but I felt like falling off whenever I moved too much.\n\nFood is average but a few things really stood out. I recommend: peking duck, roast beef, sushi, sashimi, chicken wing, and veggies. I have been to many buffets and I think Dragon Pearl does a good job of making all their dishes consistent. I don't agree on the pricing but every restaurant has inflated their prices nowadays. You are paying $25.99 per adult on a weekday and that means no lobster too. The soup is actually not too bad but I felt that it had lots of MSG. One thing that stood out was the service. I love it when people refill my water without asking, that is actually a requirement when I look for boyfriends (I know, I'm crazy). I think the only warning you need is that their kitchen closes at 9:30pm. These asians work so fast, they are mopping the floors at 9:31pm. We came shortly after 8pm so we had a solid 1.5h to enjoy our food, thought my parents complained it was rush. A tiny observation is that the soup bowls are big and since I can't carry shit, this is a big bonus. For once, I don't need to worry about dropping my bowl while walking.", 3], ["Standard Chinese buffet with really cool interior!\n\nMy fiance's family and I came here for another holiday feast. Each of us received a voucher for half of a lobster. Unfortunately no one in the family except for me is crazy about seafood. I stuffed myself silly with 1.5 lobsters. Just steamed lobsters but I didn't want them to go to waste! \n\nThe sushi was good but I couldn't let myself overstuff myself with sushi rice. My other fav was the stir fry mushroom and the grilled mushroom! The steamed cod was also really good and I helped myself 2 servings! \n\nAlthough the dessert section looked extensive, there was nothing that tasted AWESOME. I ended up filling up on the steamed gingered milk with a scoop of green tea on the side. I also had their baked \"creme brulee\"  but it tasted sooooo eggy.

Over the years, I've organized many dinner get-togethers at this place. However, the last 2 visits in the past 2 months have been rather disappointing.  The general food quality has certainly gone down the drain and the selection of food is not as good as its sister restaurant, Dragon Legend (DL). For example, DL serves this delicious fish broth based soup noodles & offers roast duck soup noodles.  There are less sashimi selections at DP vs DL.\n\nFound out today that they no longer even serve their signature dessert 'Dragon Pearl' - a huge deep fried dough ball. \n\nThe server was friendly, however, I found her very annoying. An hour into dining, she reminded us that we can only dine till 7:30pm. Thereafter, she repeatedly kept coming back to rush us like every 10/15 mins by using various tactics, e.g. clearing up the cutleries without asking to see whether we were done; giving the bill without asking; dishing out fortune cookies and wet serviettes before we even had dessert; didn't bother asking whether we wanted tea/coffee with our desserts; etc.\n\nA staff called Sophie topped off the evening by being the worst ever personnel I've ever seen in the food & beverage industry. She had the nerve to come to our table, & say that since we were all chatting, we should be done with eating & should leave. I said to her, are you kidding!  A.) We haven't even hit the 2 hours dining time limit & there were like PLENTY of empty tables around; B.) She need her eyes checked badly. There were people in our party still having their desserts.  After I pointed that out to her, she didn't even bother to apologize and just put her tail between her legs and buggered off.\n\nSave your CAD$33++/adult on the weekend & dine at Spoon & Fork instead. It serves much better made to order AYCE cuisine, and is around the corner in the same plaza!\n\nShould DP continue to run its current course, its fate will probably end up like their signature dish, the Dragon Pearl.....doomed & out of the picture!\n\nSo done with DP!", 2], ["I went there for my 30th birthday and my bill was over 800 dollars. They asked me how much tip. I always give 20 percent tip but because I was paying for over 800 and it's a buffet style, the server complained and told me it should be 10 percent tip so he pressured me to give close to 100 dollar tip. Gratituity is extra. I was alright with the service until he pressured me to pay more. He also rushed us at the very end to leave. Because of that I will not be coming back.", 2], ["So this is a sister restaurant of Dragon Legend and I definitely like Dragon Legend over Dragon Pearl. I just think the layout of Dragon Pearl is smaller and also the crowd at this location is quite busy/in a rush or like too eager to get the food. I also found that the quality of oysters here not as good as Dragon Legend. In addition, the dragon noodle station at Dragon Legend had meat toppings for the soup while this one didn't. The woman doing the oyster section was very friendly though! Overall, this buffet is better than others with its specialty items like oysters and seafood boils that include Lobster, mussels, shrimp and crawfish but it doesn't beat Dragon Legend.", 3], ["I usually do not like buffets.  I think once a year is enough for me.  Stuffing your self with food that is mass produced, not my usual cup of tea.. I am sure most of you can relate.  \n\nGotta say though, Dragon Pearl buffet is decent for that yearly one time allotment for buffets for someone like myself.  \n\nYour usual myriad of food items are all there, including some that are not available elsewhere.  There's all you can eat Peking Duck, while cooked adequately - it's best enjoyed right away as they bring it out from the kitchen. Letting it sit under the heat lamps will result in the duck meat being dry and chewy!   They also do lobsters in the evenings on weekends.  But, to control people from hoarding it all, every one gets a ticket that is unofficially transferable for one whole lobster for you to enjoy.  If someone in your party doesn't want theirs, you can definitely ask them to give it to you, much to the chagrin of the buffet staff. \n\nMy favourite items from my solo visit for a birthday definitely has to be the Peking Duck, the lobster, the spicy fried shrimps and roast beef.   The dessert selections were not bad either.  The pricing ($29.99 on weekends) does reflect the higher quality than at most other buffets. Dragon Pearl is on par with Mandarin I would say.  \n\nService was impeccable too, making sure our plates were cleared promptly without us having to flag someone down.

Water and tea are self-serve.\n \nI ordered the Wonton and Fishball Rice Noodle ($8). My brother had the Signature Lo Mein ($9) which had wonton, beef, and fishball. We also shared the veggie plate ($3). Food was very no-frills, good but nothing too special. I was a little sad to see that my bowl of soup only came with two wontons, but for the price I guess I can't complain. Next time I'll definitely get the soup without the noodles (about $1 more but you get more wontons/fishballs), as it seems to be better value. Portion was perfect for me but I can see it being a little small for a big eater (ahem, my brother).\n\nOverall, good food for the price.

I don't know how they do it but their beef is always so tender that you don't even really need to chew. The noodles were also cooked perfectly and carried the broth well.

They were slightly chewy and didn't taste too fishy, which I liked.  The broth wasn't all that flavourful, but at least it wasn't too salty or too oily/fatty.  \n\nStaff were friendly and service was really quick.  The restaurant is modern and clean looking.

This dish included \"portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, truffle paste and light cream sauce.\" I also got a bite of hers and despite hating mushroom, it was delicious. We also got the Bruschetta Al Funghi, which again included mushrooms but was nonetheless tasty. I've actually never had bruschetta prepared with mushrooms replaced by tomatoes, but I'd order it again. \n\nTo drink we got the Must Be Nice & Diablo cocktails, both of which were so good. None overly sweet which is usually my number one issue with cocktails. \n\nThe service was superb! All the waiters that served us were friendly and attentive.

The patio is also well worth a visit for the ambience and to people watch.\n\nThe pasta, like the pizzas, were well-prepared, quality ingredients, better than most but pretty classic Italian flavors and combinations.\n\nA great place for a consistently good meal in Yorkville.", 4], ["Holy Sh*t....this place sucks b@lls.\n\nOk..to be fair, the food was pretty good. I was in the mood for simple food and had the arugala salad and a pasta dish.   I have no complaints in the food dept.\n\nThe service however was horrendous.\nI have never had a waiter come up to us with our plates more than half full, and say \"are you still working on that?\"..that just baffled me.\n\nAlso, why is it so hard to fill my water glass?  That's a no brainer.  And a must if you work in the service industry.\n\nYou can see where this is going...yes the bill took forever to come.\n\nWait it gets better....\nThe bill came to $40.67.  I gave our waiter (Muda) $60.00. \nOk, now you do the math.  \nAsk yourself, what is the best logical way to provide $19.33 as change?\n\n1)  A 10 dollar bill, a 5 dollar bill, 2 toonies, + change.\n2)  Three 5 dollar bills, 2 toonies + change.\n3)  A 10 dollar bill, 4 toonies, a loonie + change.\n\nEither of those combination's seemed logical to me.  But I almost couldn't believe my eyes, when I received $19.25, in toonies and loonies. \n I just laughed..I thought that was unbelievable.  First of all, Who does that?  And second, if your gonna nickel and dime me...please don't short change me too.\n(see the pic).  \n\nI'm sure our waiter knew he was doing something unacceptable.  Instead of thanking us and handing us the billfold, he sent his bus boy to drop the billfold off to us.  \n\nOur waiter claimed that the restaurant was out of fives and tens, and could only provide change in toonies and loonies. And then he said, not to tip him.  \n\nThe whole experience left me puzzled.  I would go back for the food, but not if I'm served by the same guy.  What a weirdo.\n\ntrue story.

I love the place though, the service, the wine list, the atmosphere specially on summer evenings on the balcony. It's good wholesome Italian food. I just wish they'd update their menu once in a while.", 3], ["This Italian restaurant was fantastic. On a very busy wednesday night, we were seated promptly and our server was attentive and efficient. Our evening was unrushed, however and the setting was very romantic, perfect ambiance. \nDrinks were perfectly balanced and the wine list was approachable. \nTruffle Pappardelle was cooked perfect al dente and not heavy whatsoever. \nThe Bisteca was unbelievable flavorful and tender and presented beautifully. \nalthough i am using hyperboles, i am not exaggerating.", 5], ["Came here to celebrate a special birthday after reading all the 4+ star reviews. We made a reservation for 8:30pm on a week day and were promptly seated upon arrival. The whole restaurant had very dim lighting with a chill vibe. \n\nFood: ordered the polette Della nonna (meatball), wild mushroom truffle pizza, and papardelle wild mushroom ragu. The meatballs were a little dry but very meaty, and lacked any type of complexity. Then came the paradelle wild mushroom ragu, this dish had flakes of truffle on it, but the truffles did not really elevate the dish nor did it bring any more flavour to an already rich dish. We felt that the truffle was added on top so they can hike up the price of an average vegetarian pasta dish.  The wild mushroom truffle pizza was the star of our dining adventure here at l'unita. The toppings were rich and flavourful.  The crest was lightly burnt adding that dark rich aroma to the pizza. Would come back just for the pizza. \n\nOverall, I expected more from a place with such great reviews. The food was average, but the ambience makes it a a decent place to hang out and grab a couple glasses of wine.", 3], ["My husband and I visited L'Unita Saturday evening for dinner. The atmosphere was nice with dim lighting and exposed brick walls. \nThe service was excellent. Very prompt and the server offered us recommendations. \nThe food was delicious! We ordered the Funghi Selvatici to start which came out much different than we anticipated, but was absolutely amazing. For mains, we ordered the Wild Mushroom Bianca pizza and the Tagliatelle Al Tartufo pasta. The pizza was excellent. Rich flavour, cooked perfectly. Very happy with this. The pasta was cooked perfectly and had good flavour, but we found it too buttery.  It would have been perfect if it had less butter. For dessert we ordered the Cannoli which was incredible! White chocolate and lemony goodness.\nWe quite enjoyed our experience here and would be happy to return.", 5], ["I came for dinner here on for a date night last Friday. We had a reservation for 9PM, but were seated at the bar as we waited for our table. The moment we walked in, I loved the vibe - it had a very intimate feel and felt like I was in someone's house.\n\nWe were seated to our table a little late, but we ordered a glass of wine at the bar. Two individuals including the restaurant manager came up to us and apologized and even gave us complimentary warm olives as we waited. I thought this was so kind of them and it definitely improved our experience. Once we were seated, we ordered a seasonal pasta and seasonal pizza to eat. We ordered a potato stuffed ravioli with Parmesan and zucchini and a zucchini pizza with onions and chillies - which they were able to make completely dairy free. Everything was fresh and delicious, and not too rich in flavour. Our server was super accommodating and the food came out very fast. We also ordered digestifs, which they had a wide selection of as well as espresso.\n\nNot to mention, one of the bartenders was super friendly and made sure to say goodbye to us as we walked out. It was great experience and I will definitely be returning!", 4], ["Its pretty rare for a restaurant to get 4.5 stars consistently across Yelp, Tripadvisor, AND Google reviews. So we had high expectation for this place. Reservations were made for 8pm. \n\nWe ordered based on which menu dishes came up most frequently in past reviews. We started with the antipasto platter, which had salami, proscuitto, aged white cheddar, kalamato olives, marinated mini mushrooms, and peppers, in a pool of olive oil. \n\nBoth the salami and proscuitto were so thin that, you could see the light of the candle through each slice. Its a perfect pair with the sharp saltiness of the aged cheddar, as well as the vinagrette of mushrooms. Watch out for the small green peppers. We were told it was a pepper roulette ( 1 in 9 is spicy). I got the spicy one, and ooooooh i didnt expect it after eating several sweet ones. Olives were leftover, but everything else was delicious. \n\nIt wouldve been better if we ordered a glass of red to go along with the platter, and it was Half Priced Wine Night (tues only). But...neither of us were feeling like having alcohol, so,\n \u311f( ,  )\u310f  . \u3000\n\nFor the main dish, my friend got the pork chop, and I decided to make a special request for carbonara pasta, which wasnt on the menu. \n\nThe pork chop was cooked medium, tender, and left no aftertaste in the palate. It may have been underseasoned, but that may have been intended by the chef to show its freshness and natural flavour. \n\nThe carbonara came out very pretty. With a bed of cheese shavings and a runny egg waiting to be pierced with a fork, it looked very enticing. However when i gave it a taste, it reminded me of fancy KD sauce. The spaghetti noodles were a bit hard - a tad undercooked. Not as good as the carbonara noodles at Tostos. \n\nBoth portions were very generous, so we had no room for dessert. \n\nMaybe it was because of the half priced wine special, but the place was very loud and felt squished. We werent able to get seated for the first 5 minutes because some other guests were standing in front of our seats and obstructed the path. The place had little seating and was packed so there was little room to squeeze through despite saying excuse me. \n\nOverall, I recommend coming here earlier in the evening on another weekday, but if you dont mind a crowd and half priced bottles, then, Tuesdays it is :)", 4], ["This is my \"go-to\" neighbourhood Italian joint.

The dim lighting, candlelit tables, and soft music contributed to a romantic ambience. It is a nice setting for a date night. \n\nService:\nThe service was great. As my group entered the restaurant, the staff greeted us. Throughout the evening, our server was very attentive and ensured our water was filled up.  \n\nFood:\nThe complimentary focaccia was delicious. The bread was warm and soft. We ordered the grilled octopus, burrata, prosciutto pizza, and risotto. We enjoyed everything.\n \nOverall, it was an enjoyable dining experience.", 4], ["Very nice interior and the dim lighting makes the restaurant very romantic at night. The pasta and pizza options were quite good. However, would not recommend their prawn appetizer as they were weirdly cooked, difficult to eat, and left an unpleasant taste in the mouth afterwards", 4], ["*Small place mighty flavors\" - this is what I would say to start my review.  My boyfriend and I have chosen to come back to this place again, given the fact that there are so many Italian restaurants/competition in this city.  It is really hard to stand out I must say, yet L'unita has never disappointed us.  From the moment you walk into the door, the menu is ready on your table. The bartender Mehraz is very attentive.  The service was great, food is top-notch.  The ambiance is dreamy and relaxing. Last but not least, the food is scrumptious.  I cannot pick one single item from the menu that can pinpoint how good they are because they are all wonderful and blend well, like having a symphony in your mouth.  The truth is, there might be many other good Italian restaurants in the city, but if you miss out on L'unita, that's your loss. Take my word for it.  :)", 5], ["Very good pastas, appetizers and other entrees. Very nice selection of wine. Healthy portions - didn't leave hungry and didn't waste any.

L'Unita was offering a taste of the Basilicata region of Italy and we were looking forward to having our taste buds tickled for the evening.\n\nL'Unita is a great place situated along the border of The Annex and Yorkville neighbourhoods. The restaurant is long and narrow with a large bar for seating. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate during the evening.  The rustic light bulbs hanging above and providing illumination on the delicious Italian fare in front of you.\n\nThe staff at L'Unita are top notch and so friendly that it makes your meal even more enjoyable. They were able to help us choose a wine that would go with the impromptu prix fixe menu of the evening. \n\nSome of my favourite items from the special menu that night which I believe you can also find on the regular menu is:\n\nThe Berkshire pork ragu with roasted garlic was a memorable primi for the evening. The whole dish had that savoury Berkshire pork smell emanating throughout.\n\n\nThe other primi was the calzone. It was golden yellow in colour and had a great crunch sound when you cut into it. The filling was a combination of ricotta, swiss chard, chilies, and tomato sauce. Very home-style and true to the region.\n\n\nI have a soft spot for lamb so the grilled lamb sirloin was perfect for me. It was done spot on with a medium rare sear. The warm potato and pimentino just complimented the lamb well.\n\nI really enjoyed the evening here overall. All the different elements of a meal just came together seamlessly.", 5], ["This will be brief because, I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to say. The food at this restaurant is extraordinary, the ambience is upscale and romantic So not ideal for children or a large group of boisterous Italian men..But truly, truly unforgettable dining experience. Every dish is memorable and you can honestly say without exaggerating some of the best macaroni you've ever had.", 5], ["Hubby and I came here on an early Friday evening for dinner. We were kindly greeted upon entering and complimentary coat check was immediately offered. The hostess then led us to a spacious table in the centre of the restaurant. Unfortunately we both were wanting something a bit more cozy and asked for a table along the banquet. Our waitress said she would check and let us know. She quickly returned and said no problem and led us to a much more intimate table along the cushy banquet against an exposed brick wall adorned with large antique mirrors. The restaurant is very dimly lit with candle light at the table and classic Italian music playing overhead. \n Our waitress returned to go over the specials for the day and take our drink orders. I was a little torn between two cocktails but our waitress was great at providing insight and helping us decide.\n\nPear Sparkler - vodka, apfelkorn, aperol, pear nectar, angostura & prosecco\nAlright don't let the name fool you! Beware this drink packs a punch! I was expecting a light fruity drink but it was definitely heavy on the liquor or maybe the bartender had a heavy hand. It was still enjoyable just not what I was expecting.\nHubby ordered another cocktail that was supposed to be something mixed with orange soda and it was exceptionally strong as well, even for him.\n\nOn to the Food...\n\nHouse bread - This was too good to be free! Fresh baked focaccia with a fluffy soft interior and a bubbly crust flecked with sea salt was scrumptious and the perfect mop for a glub of that delicious olive oil.\n\n'Nduja Arancini - puttanesca tomato & parmigano\nThese little golden nuggets came out piping hot and jam packed with a creamy rice filling and oozing with cheese. They sat on a bed of spicy tomato sauce which was the perfect dipping sauce to give it a little kick.\n\nBitter Greens Insalta - radicchio, Bosc pear, almonds, & ricotta salata\nThese greens were well dressed in a creamy sweet lemony dressing that helped mute the bitterness along with the crisp sliced pears, I loved the toasty almonds that added another crunchy, and what's not to love about the heavy dusting or snow fall of ricotta salata.\n\nMargherita D.O.P. - San marzano tomato, fresh basil, fior di latte\nThe crust was perfectly thin and crispy with a subtle smokiness from the wood fire oven, light on the cheese and ample sauce. I only wish the tomato sauce had a touch more sweetness to it as I found it to be a bit too sour for my liking.\n\nT-Bone Steak alla Fiorentia - roasted garlic, rosemary, sea salt & olive oil\nOur steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and simply melted in your mouth like butter! So juicy and tender the steak was definitely the highlight of the meal. Oh and those buttery garlic cloves are always a hit!\n\nBrussels Sprouts - sherry vinegar & almonds\nThis was more of a salad/slaw of thinly sliced and shaved brussel sprouts dressed in a tangy vinaigrette. Again more crunch provided by the toasted almond slices and a surprise of thinly sliced deep fried garlic pieces. I wish I new this was a cold side as I would have ordered a different dish as I wanted a hot side to pair with the steak.\n\nTiramisu Della Nonna - espresso & kahlua lady finger cookies, mascarpone zabaglione & chocolate\nThat yummy kahlua was definitely present and forward in this dessert, the mascarpone zabaglione was on the thicker side and that really glued the dish together I would of liked a little more moisture or more espresso in the dessert to even things out a bit but it was none the less delicious and I ate every last drop.\n \nWe also ordered two cappuccinos which came a bit after my dessert. We felt maybe it was sitting for a while as it was Luke warm when it was arrived and really nothing to write home about.\n\nOverall the service here was impeccable as glasses were always promptly refilled before going dry, the tables was always cleared of plates and wiped of crumbs before the next course arrived, new cutlery reset, and napkins refolded when leaving the table. Although parts of the meal were hits and misses we still had a great time and are still reminiscing over that t-bone!", 4], ["This is a decent cozy spot that seems quite popular.

The arancini was really good though... the outer layer was perfectly thin and crispy and the inside cheesy. I had the rigatoni which I thought was just decent and my boyfriend had the mushroom pizza.

Cozy, candlelight vibes, lots of wine and mingling, upscale but not pretentious, just very enjoyable. \n\nThe wine list is really extensive, they give you a long book and a smaller drink menu with favourites and top choices. \n\nOnto the food the most important part, I don't know if I would call it very authentic italian, more italian inspired. Appetizers and starters: Antipasto piccolo was pretty good. I thought the prosciutto was good but nothing to write home about, and the bread this came with was meh and not italian. Grilled octopus tasted to die for but for 19 dollars for the starter it was just two tentacles. Now the focaccia was absolutely heaven, which made up for the bread with the antipasto because we ate it with that. \n\nThe sea bream was good, the pairing with leeks and potatoes again were great but my partner complained about portion size. Same with myself and the agnolotti. While I'm not usually one to complain about price, just 25 dollars for like 10 small agnolotti stuffed with some cheese was disappointing. I have to say their pasta is made in house which is great but it just didn't translate to the flavour that night. \n\nMy friends with the pizzas enjoyed them and that was much more bang for your buck with a good full sized pizza with great flavours.\n\nOur server was really great tho, she did an amazing job at making us feel welcome even though it was only her first week she was knowledgeable. \n\nOverall, tax and tip being 180 for two people, we weren't wowed or very full for the most part.", 3], ["One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto - this gem of Yorkville offers up what they call Farmhouse style Italian but I call extremely friendly delicious food. The restaurant itself is warm and inviting, high class without any sense of pretension. The staff really couldn't be nicer, every employee goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome and serviced. Finally the food is very high quality, with seasonal menus and a focus on simple refined flavor, by which I mean something as simple as green olives in olive oil are done such that I don't think I've had real olives or olive oil until that dish. The steak is one of my favorites in all of Toronto (you have to try it). As if the food wasn't enough the wine selection is also fantastic and the sommelier knowledgeable and friendly.

My husband ordered the calamari as an appetizer and declared it to be among the best he has had (and he orders calamari everywhere we go!) I had the Caesar salad and really enjoyed it. The restaurant dresses salads lightly, which is definitely to my taste.  We both had the Cavatelli Pugliese (delicious) and shared the gelato (hazelnut is best- although we tried all three :) ) Both of us had wine as well. I ordered the Sauvignon Blanc which was new to me, but I enjoyed it. My husband had the Montepulciano. Our reservation was for 7:30pm on a Saturday night which turned out to be a pretty good time. The early diners were just leaving so the noise level was manageable for most of our dinner. What I mean by that is that we could still have a conversation without yelling at one another. By the time we were almost finished however, the restaurant was, yet again, completely full. At this point, the noise level rose and conversation became more difficult.

She ordered  Arancini Bolognese (tomato sugo & parmigiano) and I ordered  Barese Salsiccia  (poached egg, ciabatta & tomato marmellata) for starters. The arancini was delicious! It was fried perfectly so that it wasn't too hard to bite into and there was just the right amount of cheese. The Barese Salsiccia was average. The sausage was nothing special and although the egg was cooked perfectly, there's really nothing special about an egg on top of a piece of toast.\n\nFor mains, she ordered Cornmeal Stracci Pasta (porcini mushrooms, savoy cabbage & ricotta salata) and I ordered the Wild Boar Risotto (toasted chestnuts, rocket & parmigiano). I'm not a fan of her pasta, probably because it was made with cornmeal so it tasted odd to me. However, she really enjoyed it and got her pasta craving satisfied. At first bite, my risotto was not the texture I expect it to be because I thought that it'll be softer. They used a harder rice for this dish and as I got used to the texture, I really enjoyed my dish. The chestnut in the dish really added to the flavour which surprised me because I've never had chestnut with rice before. The portion of both dishes were very generous which I really appreciated since I was starving that night!\n\nLastly, my friend ordered  Tiramisu Doughnuts (espresso mascarpone & cocoa) and I ordered  Heather's Butter Tart (vanilla gelato, candied chestnut & amaro cream) for dessert. We both thought that the flavour of the doughnuts was going to be a tiramisu flavour. It was actually doughnuts on top of tiramisu. I thought that her dessert was done very well. The doughnuts were very soft and the tiamisu went well with the doughnuts so that the whole thing wouldn't be too dry to eat. The butter tart was good but not as amazing. There was chestnut in the dessert which I should've read more carefully because I was having a chestnut overload. I personally thought that the pastry part was done very well which might have something to do with the waitress telling me that the chef was a pastry chef. My overall dessert was a bit too sweet though so I was on a sugar high as I was leaving this restaurant.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and the service here was excellent.

The serving comes with either 3 or 5 meat balls (I don't remember) so we ended up fighting over who got the bigger half of the remaining ball. I had the steak for my entree which was delicious. I eat my steak blue, which I find is hard to order in restaurants because most places overcook their steaks, but this was cooked perfectly. My fianc\u00e9 ordered one of the pizzas.

All of the staff that we interacted with or watched were being super professional, kind, and attentive to the diners. Owner/manager seemed really nice.\n\nThe atmosphere here is PERFECT. Dark, candlelit, but still lively. Upbeat music. I think it's ideal for someone who wants to take their date on a romantic dinner but doesn't want the romantic part to be awkward or overkill. Not pretentious. Like a fun bar atmosphere only dressed up nice. (But YOU don't need to dress up!) The place was packed on a Tuesday night with happy laughing people. I LOVE the atmosphere here so much. Passing by at night looking in the window made me really want to make reservations here.\n\nTuesday is half-price wine night which means you can have your $28 glass of wine for $14. So, not the best \"deal\" but I really enjoyed the wine I picked. The server was happy to recommend it to me and help me choose from the menu all of my food items. I liked that!\n\nTheir bread with olive oil to dip in is very good. The mushroom brushetta was good but messy- do not order it on a first date. The ravioli was very good without being amazing. For dessert we had the panna cotta and the cannnoli and I do recommend them both! YUM!\n\nI enjoyed it here, I'd return, and I recommend it to you. The food was really good without completely wowing me but we had a great meal here.\n\nLots of happy regulars. People sitting at the bar eating and drinking were having a great time. Bartender seemed really engaging.\n\nReservations a must. House was packed on a cold, rainy, dark Tuesday December night at 9pm. Maybe half price wine night is a huge draw or maybe it's always like that.", 4], ["Highly recommend L'Unita for anyone that wants an amazing dining experience. From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave, the service, food, ambiance and everything is short of outstanding. It's rare to find a place in the city that go above and beyond the typical Toronto \"dining experience\" and make you feel special.

Can't say enough about this place and will be back soon!", 5], ["Lovely, warm Italian spot perfect for a date night.

Boy, am I glad that the different Indian restaurant wasn't a business of their word because I had the opportunity to dine at the Leela Indian Food Bar instead :D \n\nWhen we first walked in, we were overwhelmed by the setup of the place as it practically screams that it's a trendy restaurant to be dining at. We were seated in a cozy but spacious booth near the back and we were then promptly served ice water which was lovely because it was an extremely hot day when we went. \n\nI did some light reading of this place before we came here even though I had no idea it would be where we ended up. I'm really glad that I did because otherwise, I would have never ordered the Lasooni Cauliflower which is now, hands down, my second favorite dish from this type of cuisine! \n\n[Lasooni Cauliflower] $11.95 - sweet and spicy fried cauliflower (I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH, DEFINITELY GET THIS TO SHARE OR MAYBE JUST ORDER IT AND HOARD IT FOR YOURSELF) \n\n[Butter Chicken] $14.95 - Charcoal-smoked on the table more theatrical and more flavourful, topped with melon seeds and green chilli. This butter chicken is made with fresh Ontario ripe tomatoes. I personally favored the actual sauce itself over the chicken but I'm not a heavy meat eater to begin with. The sauce was scrumptious and excellent for dipping in their freshly-made naan ~\n\n[Plain Naan] $3.25 - it is what it is but yet, it's so freaking delicious that I would recommend you get it even though Garlic Naan is also an option on the menu....\n\n[Garlic Naan] $3.50 - this is what I would typically order if the main dish isn't flavorful but I actually just ordered it here because I wanted a more diverse amount of food to review ~ I don't regret getting this one bit as the little crisps of garlic on the naan just added an extra touch of flavor to everything I devoured :D\n\nHoly moly, I would 100% drop in again to feast on everything I ordered especially since the service was super awesome too! The server was extremely kind and patient with our questions despite the fact that we had so many and she was constantly checking on us to make sure we had enough water.

We ordered dal makhni, butter chicken, chicken biryani, asparagus kofta, paneer dish and aloo gobhi. I was pleasantly surprised by the way asparagus kofta tasted. It was really good. Butter chicken was much better than most of the Indian restaurants. It was not sweet, not creamy like crazy and no artificial colouring. The chicken biryani was quite flavourful as well. Spicy though. Dal makhni, paneer dish and aloo gobhi were average. But the place itself was very nice. So different from other typical looking Indian restaurants. The service was 5/5!

I've been there twice in 4 months and they've consistently served tasty lamb biryanis that feels light and enhanced when you add the special yogurt sauce.

It's worth a little walk west from the usual Junction fare! Hope you enjoy!!!", 5], ["By far the best Indian good I've ever had. Not only was the service spectacular the warmth of the staff was awesome. I highly recommend the eggplant fries and the fried cauliflower. The butter chicken was also fantastic.  \n\nWe also ordered the spicy garlic naan which was so yummy to dip in the sauces that they provide. I highly recommend this establishment to everyone who wants a different take on traditional Indian cuisine. Also by the way great for vegans as well. Love love love this place. And lastly very reasonable!!!!!!", 5], ["Came here for date night with hubby. Great food, reasonably priced for a higher end Indian restaurant. Service was excellent.

We got gulab jamon on the house as a treat. Served hot with lots of ghee. Overall nice atmosphere, casual yet classy and intimate. It's not a huge place which makes it cozy.

My boyfriend on the other hand was happy with the overall meal. \n\nPrice: the prices were on the higher end when considering the portion size.

Now the main reason I was here. I read a few reviews on Yelp before I went and everyone seemed to big up the cauliflower and eggplant I ordered it to see what all the commotion was all about, after all how good cauliflower and eggplant can be? Big mistake on making assumptions before I tried it. All the noise and commotion is well deserved. Both are fantastic..I took some pics and I will add it to this post. The mango lassie is huge and good enough for two ppl. I have to go back and order the chk tiika and biryani. And also most of the India  restaurants I go to their washrooms look like a dungeon and are very scary so scary I can't even pee. I come running out. But not this one. It's very clean and spacious.

While my takeout dining companions ordered butter chicken I went for the asparagus kofta, and we all shared some naan and the veg biryani. The kofta balls were plentiful (I think I counted 4 of 5 big ones), tasty, and so pretty to cut into with their bright green interior. A nice change from the standard kofta. The naan held its own against the better varieties I've had, and the biryani was not only delicious but lovely to look at - it really looked jewel studded. Would definitely order from here again, or check it out in person next time I'm hungry in the junction.", 4], ["Absolutely amazing! The service was great and our waitress was very kind. The food itself was healthy and good, but I do wish they had a few more options. The portions were perfect as they were not too large but still had enough to bring home some leftovers.

It looks pretty appetizing and the flavours are there. A little bland though could use some salt, rookie mistake maybe? The chicken breast was also unusually small, if you've ever been to Nandos you'll know what I mean. Where are these places finding chickens this small? I've never seen a chicken breast this small at any grocery store. \n\nThe duck Chaufa was next. This was the big one everyone raves about it. And at $35 for what is essentially fried rice, it better be stupid good. The honest truth: it wasn't. It comes served in a hot bowl that continues cooking it. You also get a serving spoon to continue mixing if you don't want it to get too crispy. Opposite to the chicken it was actually too salty. I didn't really taste the duck and the rest of the ingredients don't really stand out either. The pepper added a nice spice to it but that's really all I can say. Like I said before it's chicken fried rice and tastes marginally better than your average Chinese place at best. \n\nOverall I was extremely disappointed, mostly because of the price. If it was reasonably priced I could justify a 3 or 4 star rating but the food doesn't taste much better than anything you can find at less than half the price.

The bartender was attentive and very knowledgeable.", 3], ["This is a venue I always come back to.\n\nAlthough the food is not exactly jaw-dropping, the ambiance of the venue and the great service make this place worth coming back to. The cocktails are a little bit overpriced for quality, however the presentation was beautiful. The music at Baro is always fun whether you want to get up and dance or just want to hang out with friends on the rooftop.\n\nThe staff - servers, bartenders, security, etc. are all very friendly and welcoming, which gives the venue a warm, welcoming vibe.", 4], ["By far this is the best restaurant I tried in Toronto. The food was so good and unbelievable. The place is amazing and the bartender Laurine was the soul of the place. Very professional and smiling all the time. It makes a huge difference when the staff are smiling and welcoming and she made sure we are welcomed. All the staff were great and happy.\n\nThe chili with lemon and salt was amazing I didn't expect it to be that good. \n\nThe patatas were yummy and the fish ceviche was super good. The octopus was delicious as well. I loved every dish I had it was all great. I'll come back for sure.", 5], ["Terrific dinner last night after travelling here as a last resort given that many restos are closed by 11pm. Glad we did.\n\nService: Friendly & accommodating\n\nFood: artichoke & dip, jamon serrano, suckling pig, pork jowls, oysters etc.\n\nWine: they've corkage, so took our own bottle.\n\nOnly drawback can be noise, it can be overwhelming. \n\nReservation in advance is recommended. I'm glad this 2nd visit changed my opinion of bar isabel and we'll return.", 4], ["I'm very late to the Bar Isabel party, but glad I made it. My wife and I went here shortly after it opened and the place was already packed. We managed to grab seats at the bar, so it made for a lively albeit tight/crowded dinner experience. The server/mixologist was friendly and helpful, offering up tips (she said they do seafood and pork really well) or a customized tasting menu. We ended up getting individual dishes:\n- Housebread: Why even call this out as a dish? Because it was good! Soft at the centre, properly crusty on the edges.\n- Cecina ala Casa: This was slivers of beef buried in a mountain of greens. Meh. Beef was nondescript and the greens were a bit limp.\n- Sobrassada and Foie Gras: Sausage and foie gras patte like spread on bread. The mixing of these strong flavours really worked well.\n- Grilled Octopus: Wow. I get why this is one of Bar Isabel's signature dishes. Excellent cook, excellent flavour.\n- Cauliflower and Almond Romesco: The cauliflower was a bit dry/tough, but the almond romesco tasted like the best homemade sauce.\n- Suckling Pork Belly: Tender, with almost a sweetness to it. Really good quality pork cooked really well.\n- Basque Cake: I get why people go gaga over this. The cake is soft inside but slightly crisped on the outer edges, and the hot sherry cream they pour on it gives the dessert some contrast.\n\nBar Isabel is pricey but worth it. Let the hype live on.", 4], ["Great restaurant with amazing seafood options and cozy atmosphere! Most dishes are tapas style -designed for sharing.  Would definitely recommend giving the oysters a try!  By far, my favourite was the foie gras.  All the seafood tasted fresh and service was prompt and polite.  Would definitely visit again!", 4], ["Had an absolutely wonderful dinner here recently. We were seated away from the crowd so it was lovely quiet relaxed experience. \n\nStarted with the Flat Earth cocktail which was delicious while being mostly a savoury drink. It was well balanced and mixed so it did not feel too heavy or strange. For food, we had the bread, oysters, octopus, tuna mojama, half service of the jamon tasting, veal sweetbreads and raw tuna, and chorizo verde. Every single dish had its unique flavours and textures which complimented each other while bringing different experiences to the table. A table favorite was the sweetbreads because every flavour and texture could be found on a single dish. The chorizo verde was so tender, full of herbs and is the first ever sausage I would describe as light. The octopus was perfectly tender. The butter sauce that it came with was too salty for my tastes, but it went well with the hearty sour bread. \n\nAbsolutely lovely meal!! Definitely a great treat!!", 4], ["Had a couple of lovely drinks with an old friend at the bar and this place was absolutely adorable! The drinks were strong and well balanced ... and they have big ice cubes!! Also definitely get the bread. Inside is cozy, dark, boisterous, and you really feel like you're in a little cafe in Spain. Sigh. I love Spain.", 5], ["If you only hit one restaurant in Toronto, make it Bar Isabel! \n\nWhen I asked my friends for Toronto recommendations, this was the only one that showed up (twice), and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is elegant but relaxed, and the food is outstanding quality. The prices are a bit high (especially the wines -- and especially the sherries, unfortunately... so we opted for cocktails), but overall worth the pricetag. \n\nMy favorites were the shishito peppers (so good), gooseneck barnacles (seasonal special), grilled mushrooms with celeriac (fantastic), and patatas bravas with boquerones (I really enjoyed and felt like only moderate heat, but too much for my wife.) I wasn't as wowed by the octopus (it was fine, but I've had better, especially for the price.)", 5], ["Business partner brought us to this place to try. It was highly recommended and so we thought we would try it out. \n\nThe atmosphere was ok. It wasn't too dark, but wasn't too light. Not too noisy so was able to keep a conversation. As it gets later, it gets louder so keep that in mind. \n\nThe menu was very limited. Not a lot of choice, and everything was small portions. We ended up sharing everything so that we could try everything. The quality of the food was amazing. Would go back, but the price of the selection was very expensive. Not for those on a budget. \n\nLost a star because the service was VERY slow. We went for dinner, and it lasted 3 hours. I don't know if it was because they were getting busy or if it took a long time for the food to be prepared, but it was slow. We kept asking why our food hadn't come. \n\nOverall, it was a good experience, but wouldn't go back unless the partner wanted to go back again.", 4], ["Had an absolutely fantastic time here ! We had reservations for 7pm on a Wednesday evening and when we arrived the place was absolutely packed. It was super loud so I'm glad we were seated near the window at the front. \n\nWe opted for a tasting menu - minimum $60 per person. The server asked everyone likes/dislikes and anything that we for sure wanted to have. It was so fun to be surprised with what we were going to eat and everything was so delicious. My favourite was the foie gras. Other highlights were definitely the chips n boquerones, chorizo, manchego cheese eaten with the pan con tomate, mushrooms, peas & mint, and cod. I didn't care much for the shishito peppers and while I enjoyed the patatas bravas and octopus, they were nothing special. We finished off with the basque cake was perfect - very rich and not too sweet. \n\nOverall I felt we had the perfect amount of food with great variety. I would definitely return !", 5], ["Definitely one of my favourite spots in Toronto! Here's a pro-tip: they offer half portions for some of the items so that you can try more items! \n\nAmbiance is beautiful, very hole-in-the-wall, dark inside lit by candles and dim warm lights. This would make an excellent date spot! \n\nThe verdict on the food is as follows. These are my \"must try\" items: \n\n1) Whole Sea Bream Ceviche: Presentation of this was very cool! It was plated on a whole fish, with lots of ceviche and flavours. It was delicious and definitely thought it was worth the money! \n2) Garlic Snow Pea Leaves: I'm someone who just loves having a side of veggies. Snow pea leaves were great, reminded me of asian style veggies, and I couldn't stop eating them. \n3) Quarter Grilled Octopus: This is a must try! The texture of the octopus was perfection, it was soft and well cooked with the perfect amount of grill on the exterior! \n\nThese are my \"try once\" items - for first timers, I think you should give it a shot but wouldn't order again due to price/value. \n- Foie gras: This dish was so interesting! It was light and airy, and was basically a pate cloud on bread. It tasted great as well, and definitely not something I've tried before. \n- Roast Bone Marrow (half portion): The bone marrow tasted great, served with bread and was very rich and fatty. \n- Scallops & Mojo Verde (half portion): We mostly ordered these because we were really craving scallops. They were good, but nothing groundbreaking! Also the portion size is quite small.\n\nBoth of the above items had great taste and flavour but were definitely small and on the higher end for price, so just be mindful of that! \n\nOverall, the food and the ambiance is great here! There was nothing I didn't like, but keep in mind that you should come with the intention of spending a little bit more, so it's a great spot to bring friends or celebrate an occasion!", 5], ["What a cool spot! Great tapas that reminded us of Barcelona (especially the pan con tomate and jamon) and a great vibe. The jam\u00f3n serrano is great -- no need to go for the Iberico for the price difference. The steak with foie gras was awesome, of course. The broccoli was great too, actually -- a little vegetable with our meat fest. They also had one of my FAVORITE white wines on the menu: Chateau Musar! It's a splurge but we would recommend it.", 5], ["Wow so so good! I will definitely be back here even if it's so hard to get a reservation. Especially loved the foie gras (to die for; one of the best in the city!), grilled octopus (very well cooked with such a tasty sauce; I was wishing for more bread to dunk in that sauce), and suckling pork belly (don't usually like pork belly but this was really tender and tasty and not fatty). I'm already dreaming of the next time!", 5], ["One of my favorite bars/restaurants in Toronto. Always exceptional experience with food, service and the ambience. Every dish you try is unique and tastes amazing. So much taste in every single tapas and dish.

But you'll know what I mean!\n\nAs for food food, get the shishito peppers and pan con tomate for apps! They are a necessity. So simple but packed with so much flavour. So addicting!! \n\nThe seafood... ahh!! Get the octopus. It's heaven. Oh oh oh! The ceviche. Oh man, it is gigantic! Every time we've been, they've always had razor clams as a special menu item.

Oh man, it is dangerously good.", 5], ["First time visiting Bar Isabel and came away quite impressed. \nTried the cured meats, ceviche, marrow, foie gras, octopus, chorizo and the basque cake.

The octopus, steak, and basque cake were our favourites.", 5], ["Bar Isabel is a sexy Spanish-Influenced speakeasy tapas style restaurant that sets the table to an expensive date. Seafood is their strong suit, but nothing to blow your sucks off. Even their coup de gr\u00e2ce, grilled Octopus, falls short of stunning your tastebuds. Thus, interesting to try as Spanish tapas may be hard to come around, but Bar Isabel has no repeat value. \n\nPart of the Top 10 Restaurants in Canada, you'll be left wondering how this restaurant ended up so high on that list.", 3], ["We spent the weekend in Toronto & had a great time.  This restaurant was the highlight of all out meals.\n\nAt first, when we pulled up, I was very concerned.  It didn't look like much & I almost said we should try something else.  Luckily we didn't \"judge this book by it's cover\". \n\nWe had a magnificent experience.  Started with oysters, which were fresh & delish. Loved the vinaigrette accompaniment.  We tried several small plates and enjoyed each very much.  Sample cheese & sausage board, tongue, squid special, bib salad & artichoke & eggplant.  Would definitely like to go back & try the marrow bone. It looked great.", 5], ["I've been here a few times and have always had a great experience with the food. This time we ordered the Sobrosada & foie gras, the fries, sea bass ceviche, bone marrow and the famous octopus (quarter size). I would say the highlights were definitely the sobrosada & foie gras, the ceviche and the bone marrow. The fries were a bit of mediocre and the octopus, thought tasty, not the best quality compared to what we had before here. It's a bit dry and the presentation (one tentacle on a few dandelion leaves) was just not that impressive. \n\nOverall it's a great meal and I would definitely come back for more food here.", 4], ["Ok for all the hardcore foodies with sophisticated pallets - get on over and order up some bone marrow and octopus already.\n\nSolid service to boot.", 4], ["Wow, just wow... Believe the hype. It's that good.  I'd heard the reviews but the menu never really jumped out at me.  That coupled with the fact it's hard to get a table kept me away longer than it should have.  What a fantastic place.  The service, the vibe, the drinks were all amazing but the real star of the show was the food.  We were a table of four and did the tasting menu.  You can set your price point so we did $60 per person.  What came next was one of the best meals of my life.  I can't recommend doing this enough.  It ended up being more dishes than I thought there would be so you get to sample quite a bit and I think it ends up being a better deal.  Too many to describe and too hard to pick favourites so just get it.

Just amazing.  Better than some of the great seafood that we have had in Miami.\nThe eggs and the potatoes were fantastic as well.\nThe tongue brioche and the fried chicken were good but not out of this world.\nEveryone needs to try this restaurant.  Totally worth all the accolades that it has been getting.", 5], ["You really need to make reservations to get a spot, especially on the weekends. The environment is unique, hipster and lively. I love the music, the waiters are nice and attentive. \n\nMy boyfriend and i started off with the meat and cheese platter, it was quite tasty and surprisingly large in portion. There were two types of meats and two types of cheese. We ordered an extra side of bread but the crust was so hard and not edible. \n\nFor the entree we ordered the razor clams and 1/2 lb of octopus. The razor clams were so good. The sauce/juice was bursting with flavours, it was delicious, i wanted to lick the plate clean, instead they provided us with free bread to dip the remaining sauce.  We then had the 1/2 lb of the famous octopus. I was expecting this dish to be outstanding but i thought it was just alright. Didn't really have much flavour in the octopus, the veggies/potatoes that came with it was kind of bland, nothing too special. I believe it was $40 for 1/2 the octopus, a bit pricy in my opinion. Our waiter forgot about our 3rd entree and i'm glad he did because i was sooo stuffed. The portions were average but the flavours were rich and notably filing.\n\nOverall, the food was great, environment was lovely. Not sure if it's the \"best\" restaurant in Toronto but it's up there. Quite pricy but it's #1 on most food list so they can pretty much charge anything.", 4], ["Where does the hype come from?\n\nAmazing: Basque cake with sherry sauce\nVery good: Sardine on baguette\n\nMediocre:\nWild mushroom - average stirfry\nCheese and meat starter - no better than Terroni\nPatatas - average \nSpanish sole - overcooked\nOctopus - good but overpriced\n\nSurprised that bread, which wasn't even special, also cost 4$.

The sour ice cream is also very very good.", 5], ["Finally found a place that has a great atmosphere and drinks!\n\nWe came here mostly for drinks, but also sampled the chorizo octopus skewers... and they were delicious.

Came here around 12am on a Friday and while there were seats available the place was totally jiving.", 4], ["Absolutely loved everything about it.

It achieves what I think all good restaurants strive for -- a total experience that's unforgettable. The vibe in the resto was infectious. The cocktails strong and tasty. The staff, friendly, charming and, gotta say, pretty sexy.\n\nBut, we went for the food and man did we get some goddamn tasty food. We were a party of 2 seated at the bar. We had the cheese plate and salumi plate to start. Then the sardine crostini followed by the amazing grilled octopus. We closed with the king crab legs -- all washed down with a nice bottle of Rioja. My only regret was not getting the ceviche.\n\nA meal at Bar Isabel will make you want to quit your job immediately and go in search of the good life. \n\nThe place was bumpin' for a Tuesday night and will only get busier now that it's been named Canada's top restaurant by En Route magazine.

Make sure to get a reservation, if possible. \n\nThe menu consists of authentic Spanish tapas (meat, cheese, grilled octopus, and crusty bread with real olive oil) and an extensive wine list (including a red from a fabulous and underrated Ontario winery, Lailey). My only critique is that the octopus was slightly overcooked but that in and of itself is not worthy of a 4-star rating -  everything else was delightful!\n\nThe service was superb (no snobbiness or hipsterness) and everyone had a smile on. They have a very well-organized coat room scheme that I found quite impressive (someone just randomly appears with your coat when you're ready to go). This did not go unnoticed.

I'm in love and I don't care who knows it!! Her name is Isabel, well some people call her Bar Isabel...but she meets all the criteria of what I'm looking for in a girl. First, she is very accommodating and I was able to reserve some of her time a day before I saw her! When I arrived and entered the door to meet her I was greeted with the smell every man looks for in a woman, that perfect combination of octopus, bread and booze. Boy, oh, boy I knew I was in for a treat! \n\nNow word on the street was Isabel got around with a bunch of different people and the night I arrived was no different. I knew monogamy was out of the question but that was OK because that sweet angel Isabel, she treated me like no other. She really took her time to service my every need if you know what I'm talking about. She described in detail everything she was going to do to me so that when it came time to order I knew without hesitation. I was a little nervous because I usually don't do this sort of thing so I loosened up with a delicious beer I've never tried. Once the sweet taste of alcohol hit my lips my inhibitions disappeared and I knew things were going to get interesting. \n\nNow I'm not one to shy away from foreplay. I've learned about its importance from the magazines that line checkout stalls but I felt a little bit intimidated by Isabel. That was not a worry though because Isabel knew exactly how to start things off.  We slowly embraced each other and began with some shisito peppers. Never have peppers felt or tasted so good on my lips. My body's senses started heightening and I could feel my stomach slowly begin to pulse. My breathing was getting heavier and as soon as we finished the peppers Isabel brought some Sobrassada & Foie Gras. Ohhhhh ya the crispiness of the bread and flakiness of the foie gras sent a rush through my esophagus. I could feel things getting heavier and heavier the anticipation building with each bite.  We continued and she started getting really nasty now. She was showing off her dirty side with some blood sausage and patatas bravas which had me purring like a cat in heat. At this point I thought I was going to explode with pleasure at any second. As soon as she brought out the Octopus my entire body was on edge. It was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  I was starting to reach my peak, one bite of deliciousness after another, faster and faster, oh my god I couldn't stop now, bite, bite, bite, I couldn't hold it - the pleasure moved to the tips of my toes and then 8 OZ BAVETTE, 8 OZ BAVETTE, 8 OZ BAVETTE!!!! My entire body released a wave of pleasure stronger than all the heroin in Toronto. Ahhh amazing. We caught our breath and ate some delicious basque cake with sherry cream which would have had me going for round 2 but I was still tired.\n\nSome say love like that doesn't come around very often and I tend to agree.  Even though I had to pay pretty handsomely for her services Isabel delivered and I know this was not just a one night stand. I will see that sweet girl again and until then she will linger in my dreams.", 5], ["I love this place. Food is full of flavour, and well executed. The service is attentive and unpretentious and the vibe is relaxed and fun. \n\nKeep up the good work! I've been sending all my friends here. I can't wait to come back!", 5], ["Despite the street facing front window being open and having all of the ceiling fans on full blast, it was almost unbearably warm inside of Bar Isabel on a recent jam packed weekday night. The music was on high and made casual conversation difficult, but the dim lighting and intimate tables gave the place a romantic vibe. \n\nThe cocktails are playfully named and described and pretty good, although I do find $15 to be a bit more than I would like to pay for a casual drink (especially when I'm prone to multiples). My friends both opted for draft beers, which there were a number of to choose from.\n\nIt was really busy, but the service was decent. Water service was sparse since the glasses are tiny. It would be nice if they could just leave carafes at each table in consideration of the hot weather.\n\nThe fried chicken is fantastic and reminiscent of the Emmet Ray version, which is cooked sous vide. Bar Isabel's healthy portion comes is somehow as moist and tender as can be and is served with a buttermilk sauce that has a tantalizing hint of a kick at the finish.\n\nThe rest of the menu looks great. I can't wait to try everything else.", 4], ["There has been much press about this place, so I went in with mixed feelings: 1) This place should be pretty good and 2) But can it really be THAT good after so much publicity?  The verdict, it really is that good.  Also, one thing is for sure, you definitely need reservations - I went on a Monday evening and heard people being told that it would be over an hour wait just to be seated at the bar.   They have a very nice cocktail menu, with lots of interesting concoctions.  I tried the Older Flame which is a mix of gin, with lots of citrus notes, and egg white.  The drink was very good and quite refreshing.  The food here is served tapas style, here is what our table tried:\n\n1) Oysters: Extremely fresh served with a vinaigrette sauce and what I assume is their take on cocktail sauce... whatever it was, it was delicious.\n\n2) Charcuterie board: We had 4 selections of meats, but my favourite was the chorizo. It had a nice kick to it, but was very flavourful.  The other meats were all thinly sliced and melt in your mouth.\n\n3) Roasted Bone Marrow: You can't really go too wrong with this.  Served with bread, it's like eating the offspring if cream and butter had a baby...again you cannot go wrong here.\n\n4) Whole Fish Ceviche:  I'm not sure what I was expecting but I thought the fish would be bigger.  Nonetheless, the ceviche was fresh, had lots of avocado chunks and very well seasoned.\n\n5) Grilled 1/2 octopus: This was my favourite dish of the night.  Served with greens and potatoes, the octopus is so soft and tender and you could really taste the nice char they have on it.  \n\n6) Chickpeas and snow pea leaves:  I must say that I am not a fan of chickpeas in general.  However, this dish was really really good.  The chilis on top were not overly spicy and the flavouring was excellent.  For a non-chickpea fan, this dish was surprisingly good.\n\n7) Basque Cake & Sherry Cream: The cake was nice and moist and the cream wasn't overly sweet.  I'm not really a sweets person, but my friends swear by this cake...so I'm going to forward along their recommendations on this one.\n\nAs an overall experience, the food was consistently good and service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend a visit to this place, assuming you make a reservation.", 4], ["I do not understand the hype around this place. \n\nDrinks are not made well and they are tiny and service is extremely slow.

Crunchy and flavorful w/ just enough heat to remind you it's spicy.\n\nWhole fish ceviche: chunks of fish marinated in lime w/ chunks of rich, smooth avocado to cut the acid. Just order it, it's amazing.\n\nBC spot prawns: off-menu special was cooked on a bed of smoking wood chips. The heads were flavorful and the tails were smooth, barely cooked, sweet and served w/ clarified butter and gray sea salt. Another standout.\n\nBasque cake w/ sherry cream: Served warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It's a good traditional dessert.\n\nButtermilk panna cotta w/ celery and buckwheat crumble: This was less traditional, but still a standout. Be prepared, it's celery flavored and tart w/ the crumble providing a textural and sweet contrast.\n\ntl;dr: The food has flavor. It's not salty, it's actually flavorful. That's not surprising considering the chef's time at Ad Hoc. Throw in excellent cocktails, and you got yourself a winner.", 5], ["This is really a 4.5 star review and I feel bad being particularly critical of Bar Isabel as the hype and expectation certainly made me more critical of the dining experience. \n\nI came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and ordered the Sobrassada, Foie Gras & Honey Montadito, roast bone marrow, whole sea bream ceviche, half octopus, and sweetbreads.\n\nLet me start off by saying that was too much food by 1-1.5 dishes for my girlfriend and I and I'm a big eater. \n\nThe service was some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. The first dish came very quickly and the subsequent dishes did not come until we were comfortably finished with the previous dish. The sequencing also made sense, with the bone marrow coming after the ceviche although the ceviche was a bigger dish. \n\nI thought everything was delicious, but the bone marrow was stand-out for me as being a steal based on the quantity. \n\nGiven that every other part of my experience was amazing, I'll discuss the negatives. The half octopus dish was a bit too oily. While this wasn't a problem for the octopus itself, the rapini on the plate was drenched and every bite oozed buttery oil into your mouth. As an avid fan of cocktails, I also had high expectations and while the drinks were good, they were slightly overpriced compared to other great cocktail places around Toronto (IMO county general, cocktail bar, sidecar, temperance society). In particular, the grand slam fizz was a disappointment. It looked like a strawberry milkshake and kind of tasted like a very diluted version with a hint of absinthe.\n\nOverall definitely worth going though and I will be back.", 4], ["As if I expected anything different from the founder of http://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-hoof-toronto , Grant Van Gameron!

It has a very hipster vibe, which typically indicates a we don't care type of service offering, however here it is top quality service.  Servers are attentive, personable and exude care.  I went with my daughter who they spoke with many times to see if \"SHE\" was ok, made jokes and served here dishes and asked if she \"wanted\" to share them with me.  Top quality service, not found often in this city.\n\nWe ordered 6 dishes at once and the server \"offered\" an order to serve the dishes so they do not all come at once.  This was a nice touch.\n\nThe food?  Ah, the food.\n\nDuck egg, chorizo pork fat hollandaise.  Yup, no butter, just pork fat.  \n\nMixed charcut of Buffalo Slinzega, Iberico Salchichon, cappicola (daughter's fav), Hogtown charcuterie smokey goodness, Bresoala, lonza (loin) all served with some of the best bread in the city.  Bread where the crust is the star.  Like a crispy, chewy treat!\n\nNext up spicy horse tartare.  The meat was bright and fresh, better then beef in my opinion for that reason and resembled the highest quality Toro (tuna) cut.  All topped with a spicy alioli.  Daughter liked this before she found out it was horse.  Does that make me a bad person? \n\nThen a tongue sandwich which was huge and loved the portion.  Warm ,thin sliced tongue, in some bad azz bread.  But wait there is more.  A hipster style place, plaid everywhere and the presence of take-out containers?  This is true and it happened and there is no lies about it.  I took out my tongue sandwich.  I talked to Grant who advised to bring it home, add cheese and turn it into a grilled cheese.  Ah, yeah, done and done in the morning.\n\nOh damn, the bone marrow.  It is what it is.  Bone Marrow!  Huge long bone, roasted to perfection, served with toasted buttered bread and a small perfectly sized spoon to be able to get every bit of the marrow goodness.  Table dressed with a bowl of coarse salt to garnish your marrow which comes out slightly red inside and placed on the bread.  You then close your eyes, and wish you were no where else and would never leave.  Yeah it is that good.\nSO anyway, I am back and you should go and never go anywhere else :)", 5], ["My favourite restaurant in TO right now. The bone marrow is always good. The octopus is off the charts. The drinks are stiff and delicious.", 5], ["Amazing food. Even better service. \nYou get fresh bread, and also we got another appetizer as a surprise (we didn't even order it). \nGot two pasta dishes- Lobster ravioli was delicious, as well as the gnocchi. \nWe didn't order dessert as we were in a time crunch but the server even brought us a sample of ?tiramisu!", 5], ["The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.\n\nHowever, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.\n\nThe decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)", 3], ["I went here for my dinner on a Monday night! \nThis place is a one man show! Excellent food, everything freshly made with nice flavours! I was told that they make fresh pasta but i dont think so. Also, 4 stars only because the Tiramisu wasnt the best. Maybe needs to work better on the desserts part of the menu!\nOtherwise, food was great! My fav was the limon pasta!", 4], ["I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: \n\nPros: \n- The food is good \n- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. \n- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. \n- a lot of street parking nearby\n\nCons: \n- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. \n- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. \n- The decor is very outdated. \n- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. \n\nIn my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.", 2], ["Interesting spot.\nOwner, chef is friendly (not phoney, which I appreciated). \nI appreciated the fair price and quick service.\nDecor is NOT great, needs tables, chairs, etc..  it's clean, most importantly.\nReally enjoyed the spaghetti w meatballs.", 4], ["This place is very unpretentious with its decor but what it lacks in decor, makes up for in delicious food and great hospitality. I tried the gnocchi with mushrooms, special on the menu and was thoroughly impressed by the presentation and taste. The gnocchi was definately house made something i was very impressed since many places use pre-made pastas for their dishes. I wasnt super impressed with the dessert but honestly this is not why i came here for in the first place. The owner chef is also a very hospitable individual and it seems that he takes great pride in what he does. I look forward to coming back and try more of their offerings!", 5], ["This place is a hidden gem and the prices are great! It looks like the restaurant needs some renovation, but don't be fooled by the interior, the food here is great!\n\nService:\n\nThe owner is very friendly and welcoming. He is the chef as well. The service was attentive and the server ensured everything was going well.  \n\nFood:\n\nLobster Risotto - This was very creamy and cheesy. I took one bite and I knew right away that this is something I would order again if I return in the future. Highly recommend this if you eat here.\n\nGnocchi - The gnocchi is handmade and it was delicious. The texture of the gnocchi was amazing. The gnocchi was in a rose sauce and this was very tasty. \n\nOverall:\n\nI enjoyed the food here very much; I absolutely love the pasta here! The prices are also very good for the food quality. I will definitely return to try more pasta.", 4], ["Our entire meal was fresh and delicious!\n\nWe were given a warm loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, followed by an amuse bouche of grilled zucchini topped with mashed sweet potato and a balsamic glaze. A lovely way to start our meal. \n\nNext came the mozzarella fritters with a chunky tomato sauce. They were rounds of mozzarella in a bread crumb coating. They were light and crisp, melty and yummy! You could see and taste the herbs and the delicious saltiness went perfectly with the sweet freshness of the tomato sauce. Our main dish was Agio's gnocci with porcini mushrooms and Alfredo sauce. It was rich, creamy with nice chunks of mushroom. The gnocci was cooked to the right texture and the mushroom and cream sauce was very rich, flavourful and satisfying. \n\nWe finished our meal with a perfect creme brulee - a lightly sweet and super airy filling topped with a crunchy sugar shell. One of the best I've tasted in Toronto. \n\nTry Agio! (PS. Sorry I was too excited to eat that I forgot to snap pics of the fritters and the creme brulee!)", 4], ["To be honest, when I walked into this small restaurant, I was shocked because it looked very small and outdated! It was quite sketchy. However, when the food was here,OMG! The seasoning of my lobster pasta is perfect! I was not a big fan of tomato sauce nor the carbs. But I forgot about my diet plan and had LOTs of pasta! My husband order the steak, which was seasoning perfect as well. The cut of meat was great and favour is right at the point. \nWell the only downside was the home made tiramisu, which was very disappointed. I had lots of different types of tiramisu in Italy and Italian restaurants. This one was definitely on the AVOIDLIST. \nHowever, I'll go back soon to try other dishes for sure!", 4], ["Amazing food!!  I would only recommend eating here if you have time to enjoy the food since at times it's a one-man show and it may take a while to get your meal.  I truly enjoyed all the things I tried here starting with the complimentary bread.  It was warm, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle...simple exquisite. \n\nStraciatella Soup$7.50  - This Italian egg drop soup is addictive and I had it every time I came here.\n\nThe chef brought out a complimentary zucchini bite appetizer while we waited for dinner and it was finger licking good.  The zucchini is grilled and topped with butternut squash and sauce.\n\nLobster pasta $38 - Daaaamn, this dish was hella delicious.  The lobster was fresh and meaty.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and covered in delicious tomato sauce.\n\nCauliflower Fritter $10.50 - These lightly breaded and deep fried cauliflowers were so good on their own that I didn't eat much of the 2 different dipping sauce that accompanied them.\n\nSpaghetti Carbonara $18 - Loved it!  The sauce was creamy and flavorful.  The pasta was cooked just right.  Simple dish, but very satisfying. \n\nThe dessert game here is not as strong as the rest of the food.  They offer tiramisu and cr\u00e8me brulee for $8.\n\nStreet parking right on St Clair was free and easy to find on a weekday.\n\n....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      \n.../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    \n..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

Absolutely excellent. \n\nAs it was our anniversary, the owner/chef gave us (my spouse) a lovely serving of tiramisu served in a martini glass. Nice.\n\nThis is definitely a local restaurant where food is treated in a special and personal way.", 5], ["My friend and I almost walked right out after arriving at Agio and finding ourselves the only 2 people there for at least 10 minutes. There were plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a chance. Things started to look up after the chef/owner finally came out of the kitchen. The restaurants decor is quirky and if you dont care about aesthetics, I think you will enjoy this restaurant. The Korean man knows his Italian food. His entertaining stories are a bonus.", 4], ["I've been to Agio several times.  I used to stay in the neighbourhood and visit often and I wish I still was.  Excellent and always fresh.  Marino is always solicitous and the sketches are of past patrons, by Clara.  You might ask about it if you're curious.  It's not, \"decor,\" per se, because that's not what they're aiming for.  They are aiming to be a part of the neighbourhood.  I've had the ravioli, the spaghetti with meatballs, the eggplant, the gnocchi, the desserts, and more.  He is especially good with  savoury dishes, it is true, but then I am not fond of desserts in general.  Try this tiny little place!\n\n*It is what the French call, \"serious,\" food.  There is no need for fancy dressing up or fancy decor.  People who enjoy *eating* will enjoy this place.", 5], ["We took a chance on this place based on the reviews, thanks Yelpers! It's an interesting venue with an eccentric proprietor/chef Marino, an Asian person cooking gourmet Italian was an interesting surprise. Hey can cook Italian!\nWe had a difficult time choosing a couple of appetizers, had the eggplant rolls which was excellent, and the king mushrooms. \nWe both had the lobster pasta, very good sauce, tasty well cooked lobster, it was a little spicy. I would have preferred if the pasta was fresh made and not dry bought. That fell a little short of my expectations, but the flavours were very good. \nWe plan to return with my kids and plan an exotic Italian menu, family style. Marino said he can prepare gnudi pasta, which is a special treat. Hope he delivers on our expectations.", 4], ["A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. \n\nPitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. \n\nThere were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. \n\nWe arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. \n\nWe sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. \n\nAt 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. \n\nOur entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. \n\nWe finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. \n\nI liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. \n\nThe chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. \n\nWe ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. \n\nDisappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. \n\nJust wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(\n\nI was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. \n\nIt does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.", 3], ["This is a hidden gem! If you are ever in the Toronto area, Agio is a must. Everything from the friendly service, cozy environment and authentic food was beyond incredible. I would highly recommend from the appetizer menu the cauliflower fritters, grilled and fried calamari. The owner also gave great recommendations for our main courses and they were all delicious. I will certainly visit again my next time in Toronto.", 5], ["I wanted to give this pace 5* because of their great service and freebies. I mean, it's a cute, tiny place, the 2 people who were staffing (older Asian man and youngish Asian girl) were nice, and they gave us a free app (squash on zucchini with some type of sauce) and a free cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e at the end: 1 for 2 to share. \n\nSo service-wise, it was a definite 5/5. I felt like a real VIP here. \n\nCarbonaras ($17) looked great and so did the coffees. However, they had run out of Italian coffee, so that was a tad odd. \n\nI had the lobster pasta in red sauce (that's actually its description, and the price of $38 was not disclosed in the menu). Man, that was a GIANT plate. Getting the meat was a real workout but worth. They gave a whole lobster with the proper equipment and lemon water so I didn't smell like PEI after. \n\nLobster was good, I'm sure, but the sauce was too overwhelming to get the taste of lobster. Then again, lobster is generally mild but still. Pasta texture and all was great. Sauce was a little spicy but I think I should have mixed it all up first so the spice wasn't just on the top. \n\nCr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was great! The caramel was a little thick but I guess some like it thick. The custard was very smooth, no lumps, and it wasn't cold. I know that's a weird expectation but I've had cold, liquid custard before... as a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I def recommend this dessert. The portion was just right for 2 people. \n\nWould I recommend? Yes, because it's at an average price (maybe $1 pricier than other places) but with spectacular service.", 4], ["Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation. \nWe apologize but he kept on going which makes it awkward for us and leaves a sour taste on otherwise a nice evening out with friends and good meal.", 3], ["The best authentic Italian food I've had in quite some time. The grilled eggplant stuffed with ricotta is the perfect combination of flavors and you can taste the freshness of every layer of flavor in each bite. The lobster pasta dish is simply divine and the tomato sauce i want to bathe in!!!! I will definitely be back! OUTSTANDING", 5], ["What an incredible experience we had at Agio. Visiting from Los Angeles and looking for a reasonably priced and highly rated Italian restaurant, we stumbled upon Agio. The Chef and owner is a one man show who puts so much love into his cooking. From the delicious amuse bouche to the desserts, every bite was fantastic. It was such a pleasure to dine at Agio and was one of the most memorable meals of our trip. If we lived in the area we would be regulars for sure. It was a bit hot in the restaurant as it was a very warm day, but other than that no complaints.", 5], ["It's amazing how the last time I checked out reviews for Agio, that the number grew from a single digit to the 20s--hardly surprising! \n\nThank you to the Yelpers who led me to Agio! I wanted to check it out for a while but never got around to it--but then I DID! And now I can't stop! I've been there four times in the last six weeks, it's that good!! I've no idea how the one-star-giver came up with that rating, as the quality has been consistent each time, though there have been slight variances with each visit (nothing bad, just new or unexpected). (How is it that some reviews go filtred while others don't?)\n\nEnough talk about \"authenticity,\" blahblahblah. I want to choke someone whenever I see this in reviews or hear it being thrown around the way people call themselves \"foodies\" because they think 'someone who eats food' is its definition. Please, enough already. I believe authenticity comes from the way in which food is prepared (methods, etc) in that it stays true to its traditional way of being made, including the ingredients being used, quality and specificity being factors too, etc. Contemporary takes on traditional dishes/cuisines is something else altogether, and that's great too. But because a Korean is making Italian food doesn't make it any less \"authentic\". *NEWS FLASH* If you've ever looked into the kitchen of many restaurants, you'll find that a lot of the cooks are Sri Lankan (or at least that used to be the trend a few years ago). That's right, folks: Sri Lankan! In the US, you'll find Mexicans in the kitchens of many restos--I've had some amazing Korean BBQ in the US made by a Mexican, just as good as my mom's! People go to Rome and eat at some tourist hell and think they ate authentic because they ate it in the food's country of origin--not so! To put it simply, I go out of my way to avoid tourist traps and I've been to Italy which DOESN'T MAKE ME AN EXPERT, but I will say that Chef Marino makes some fine-ass food and he clearly LOVES what he does; he doesn't cut corners and everything is fresh and delicious! He puts things together that one may not expect yet it's always good! The d\u00e9cor is a real mish-mash of stuff but once you learn their significance, you'll come to appreciate and understand its charm.\n\nI've had the following dishes:\n\n- bruschetta: COVERED in the usual diced tomato w/hints of basil and garlic undertone, sometimes roasted red peppers smothered in olive oil and pesto. The bread is always the right crispness. I don't get how Chef Marino does this working solo in a busy kitchen! How does he not burn the bread?? None of the flavours overpower one another and you can taste the freshness in every bite.\n- mixed green salad w/grilled calamari: two huge calamari on a heap of mixed greens in citrus balsamic dressing. The citrus rounds out the tartness of the balsamic and it's oh so good~\n- gnocchi: I've had this almost each time, always with a different sauce. I don't like tomato sauce in this dish so I usually ask for something pesto-y or with butter/olive oil/garlic. Perfectly cooked each time!\n- spaghetti with meatballs: tomato sauce; this dish tastes different each time, meatballs have a nice flavor to them.\n- lobster ravioli: I've had this every which way as well. My fave was the creamy pesto-y sauce. I should mention that chef Marino's pesto rivals one that I can only find in Montreal. Other pestos are too pasty.\n- sea bass: MMMMM, love seabass. This is one of their specials so it's not always available but if it is, try it! Comes with sides that are also great.\n- desserts are made in-house. I've had both tiramisu and the cr\u00e8me brule. I love them they're not too sweet and as for the cr\u00e8me brule, where other cr\u00e8me brules fail, somehow Chef Marino manages to get it right and then some!\n\nI don't want to encourage people to go to Agio expecting freebies as some people are really tacky like that, but do go to enjoy the food. If you catch Marino on a less-busy day, have a chat with him. He is SUCH an interesting character and if you've traveled and love food, you'll gain a much deeper appreciation for what he does, and this restaurant is obviously a labour of love for him. It's evident in the way he presents his food, the time and care he puts into each dish which is on a very rare level for this price-point, and the fact that he is able to handle a full restaurant all by himself during the sweltering heat on some days tells me he's a real pro.\n \nIf you haven't been, do check this place out; if you have, I'm sure you understand some of the cravings I get. I've taken many friends and family who know food to Agio and they all love it. Portions are big but do try different things. When you come across a well-trained chef who loves his craft this much, you can't go wrong. Now run along! It's on St. Clair West, a few doors west of Lansdowne.", 5], ["If the restaurant business had a God it would be Chef Marino. He is an awesome person. After one visit my party felt like we were considered regulars. His hospitality is so rare to find in Toronto. The food on the other hand is the best food I have ever eaten. Ever. Everything we ordered was made fresh, including the pasta. There were three of us in our party and we all received our meals in under 15 minutes. After having our first bite I swear we were in heaven. Chef Marino runs the whole restaurant by himself and Agio is better than restaurants that have staff. Thank you Chef Marino!", 5], ["Awesome is the one word that describes this marvellous little restaurant, totally worth every cent you spend. Treated like royalty, the best tiramisu we have ever had.

This is italian food!!!   The warm spinach salad with olive oil, garlic and white wine is delicious, caprese salad with or without buffalo mozarella ...mmmmm.  Pumpkin or potato gnocchi - fresh and the perfect consistency.  Grilled whole fish with tasty crisp veggies...  decided to go all out and try the rabbit stew with polenta - and I was not disappointed and ended with tiramisu... prices are great. Like the previous reviewer, Marino is Korean and his training and living in Italy  (see the pictures on the wall of him with other famous chefs) comes through in his dishes....  he also speaks fluent Italian...", 5], ["A+ for service D for food. The host/owner/chef/waiter is very nice, the service was delayed because he was running the place by himself but that gives you time to enjoy the place so no biggie here. The food was very disappointing, soups were bland and the meat in the main dishes tasted bad, with the sausage being non edible. We were taken care of and had we complained, I'm sure the issue would've been addressed. We were given free dessert and a free appetizer for no reason at all. So the opening sums it up great service. Bad food. That was my experience.", 2], ["At first, we just didn't know what to make of this place: it's a bit eccentric inside. Once we met the chef and his wife, however, I thought we might be in for something special. Turns out we were. This is a totally refreshing restaurant. They are passionate about food, and they are charming, quirky hosts. The meal was fantastic. We had some eggplant roll as an appetizer and delicious tiramisu for dessert. I had the lobster ravioli as a main, and it was awesome. We left with huge, bemused grins on our faces.", 5], ["This little gem of a place is amazing. I actually adore the intimate decor, filled with artwork done by the chef's wife. Although not on the regular menu, the lobster pasta special is to die for.  Every single bite of food is prepared with love and care, down to the garlic bread slices served with our pasta. Marino clearly cares about real food. I also recommend the tiramisu, a velvety and creamy concoction - the perfect end to a great meal.", 5], ["I arranged a reservation from Royal Oak , MI to celebrate my son's birthday with his girlfriend and her parents whom we had not yet met. This was a wonderful place for such a meeting and celebration. It is small, cozy and eccentric and we were so warmly greeted and served by the waitress who is the wife of the chef. The chef treated us to several free \"samples\" of soup and appetizers. The presentation of the food was elegant, and the food was delicious and my husband raved over the Korean salad. There is an full page of vegetarian options  which was good as one of our company is a vegan.  We were not rushed and the atmosphere was relaxed and happy. The artwork is most interesting. The chef came out and visited us and told us about his way of preparing tiramisu which was excellant.... he treated the birthday person to one of these. The chef is passionate about the high quality of his creations . although intially uncertain, we  were not disappointed by our choice of this restuarant. Personally, I liked the decor . It added to the experience for me. I liked knowing that it was a place where there was a following of regular customers who are like \"family\". It was a fun and quite different. I would like to eat there again when I  return to Toronto.", 5], ["They have an extensive beer menu and lots of food options to choose from. The place is also pretty big and seats a lot of people.

Someone recommended this place and while it is a cute place I definitely don't feel that it was a place to go out of my way far. I'm giving this place at 3 because I do feel like the place is a great place for friends to have a casual meet up for some drinks or even to play pool which was gold which is in the dining area. So that looks like a nice spot atmosphere. I did feel that the place was not overly packed but the service was slow. Benefit of the doubt maybe they were short-staffed at night. Sadly I did learn not to mix poutine and hard cider as that was not a great combination for my stomach hahaha. Overall the poutine did have a nice flavor and I did like the hard side of that they serve me.

At some point, I didn't feel well, either due to food I had earlier or because the last place we were at didn't serve us water (that's why we left) and went to the bathroom. I made myself throw up, just a small amount, to make sure anything I'm that was causing me to feel ill was out. I hear the staff member outside the stall asking me if I was ok,  if I needed water. I assured her I was fine, and had water on the table and explained the reason for why I wasn't feeling well. \n\nWhen I got out of the stall, she said she couldn't leave me and that I had to leave the bar. I was shocked and she followed me back to my table. The waiter brought our bill and wasn't sure why she was told to, she was shocked too when I told her. I started to cry, because I was so embarrassed. My friend insisted I finish my drink, which I did. The security member was watching us the entire time, standing a few feet back. \n\nWhen we headed out, she escorted us out, saying how I was a liability, that she needed to make sure we were in a cab or on the sidewalk, asking if we were driving and saying where we went was now \"up to her\" (me). \n\nI understand her reasoning, but at the same time we were not disruptive and made my friend feel like he was a bad guy, and myself feel degraded.", 1], ["A small group of friends and I came here at 8pm on a Saturday evening!

I got the Aussie Rules which is an Australian Sparkling Ale and it was light and refreshing. we also ordered the traditional poutine and fries to share and they were okay. Nothing spectacular about them. What I wanted to try the most was the Beer Float. I have never had the beer float and was told by the server that it is one of those drinks where you either love it or hate it. The description says that it is \"a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a cherry on top of your choice of Mocha Porter or St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout\". I chose the Mocha Porter. The taste was very interesting; and just like what our server had forewarned, I absolutely LOVED it but my friends all HATED it. The beer was dark but the ice cream definitely cut the bitter taste. \n\nAfter eating and drinking or perhaps while waiting for your meal, why not play a game of pool.

I had the butter chicken and a side of the Brussels Sprouts. My friend had the butter chicken frites and enjoyed them.

We also love how they change up their beers seasonally and how the place gives off a cottage vibe. The service is normally very good and the servers are always knowledgable about the different food and beer pairings. The only downside to this establishment is that the food portions seemed a bit small last time I went. For instance, I upgraded my fries to a poutine which I felt meant getting less fries because the poutine was TINY! Sadly, I was still a bit hungry after my meal :( Apart from that, I love coming to this place!", 4], ["Since making my 1st ever visit to the venue in 2007 I think C'est What has become my most-often visited venue of all time.  This is due primarily to the fact that a social Group I helped run has had Events here since the Group first started about 10  1/2 years ago and the venue is pretty close to where I live.  I consider C'est What to be my favourite bar in Toronto.  Why, you might ask?\n\nRead on to find out:\n\nThe venue used to be a wine cellar housed in a 100+ year old building; since C'est What first opened back in the late 1980's, there have been a multitude of different Events here.  My 1st visit here in 2007 was also the first time I attended a Beer Fest., which they host twice a year.  Called the Spring (or Fall) Festival of Craft Breweries, there's no admission fee, sampling stations set up at both bars in the venue and you pay $1 for a 3 to 5 ounce sample of beer (a small no. of beers at the Fest. cost 2 or 3 tickets - you buy tickets for all samples at the front entrance of the bar).  There's always about 48 (!) beers to choose from including cask selections, seasonal beers and one-offs, etc.  They also have other Events such as tap takeovers; live entertainment on certain nights and even their own radio station.\n\nWith over 40 taps specializing in Ontario Craft Beer, C'est What is a beer lover's paradise.  They also have a wide variety of often unique/eclectic food choices.  On the left/east side they have pool tables and dart boards and quite a bit of seating on both sides of the bar which is quite a large venue overall.  They even have a large fish bowl and a nice fireplace just inside the left entrance, where several friends and I sat and enjoyed beers and food at my last visit there just yesterday.\n\nI've found the service to be fairly good there over the years; they allow you to sample the beers if you're not sure what you want to order and/or want to sample something new or something you haven't had before.  Yesterday a friend and I split their Tostidos which were quite flavourful; on previous visits I've had or shared their veggie burger, calamari, nachos or fries.  A long time ago I had brunch there on several occasions with another social Group.\n\nWith low ceilings, somewhat upscale and unique d\u00e9cor and an obviously distinct layout, the ambiance of C'est What is like no other venue I've been to.  It can get crowded on certain nights with correspondingly slow(er) service at times.  The prices for food and beverages are somewhat high but you have to take into account the fact that the venue is located in the downtown core.  Conveniently located close to several subway stations, not to mention St. Lawrence Market and the Financial District, C'est What is a great destination for regulars, tourists and occasional visitors alike.", 5], ["Last night started and ended here, which if I remember is a good thing! It was busy so sat in a corner running Toronto beer fights. They've about 40+ local beers plus about 6 of their own. The band was really enjoyable as well.

Overall an enjoyable night...if I remember correctly!  ;)", 4], ["I was here for live music on the night of Jan 5, and while the music and performers themselves were fabulous, the host left a bitter taste in my mouth. \n\nWe've never been there for a live music before, so we just asked for a table for two, not knowing it was a separate area for the music. We only realized when we sat down, so we told our waitress that we were actually there for the live music, and she told us to just directly head on over to that area. We did as told, found ourselves a table... only for the host to come to us 10 minutes later saying in a not very friendly tone something along the lines of \"You can't just move here yourselves... you need to let the host know.\" That's literally all she came to our table for... to tell us that we did something wrong... like a teacher telling her students that they did something wrong. First of all, we would have told the host if the waitress told us to, but we were just told we can move their directly so we did. But even so, isn't it the waitress' job to let you know? Second of all, it was rude for her to come over just to make a point that we did something wrong... correct me if I'm wrong, but that's definitely not how you treat your customers. \n\nI'm still giving two stars because I had decent previous experiences and the live music that night was great.", 2], ["Interesting place near down town close to Union station.

Been hearing a lot of good things about C'est What, so off I went. Takes a lot of convincing to eat somewhere with good beer. ;) \n\nLocated in a lower level on Front St, it was about a 10min walk from Union. It's open concept, so it doesn't feel like you're in a basement. The staff are warm and welcoming. We were seated and headed for the beer menu(it is a good one!). It seemed like many patrons had also come here for a beer after a long day! Seemed like the right thing to do. I don't see McAuslan's Apricot Wheat on many menus, so that sealed the deal. My friend is a hoppier beer drinker and tried the Big Butt Smoked Dark Ale and the Chocolate Ale. I tasted both. The smoked ale tasted like beer and bacon.... it was interesting! I'm a chocolate gal, but I don't feel the chocolate flavour came through as strong as it should have. Many other beers on the menu I'd like to try! \n\nAs for food, we shared a Buffalo Burger and a Lamburger. I mostly just wanted to say 'Lamburger' out loud. So worth it. The Bison burger was tasty! Bison a very lean meat, so there was ample tomato-onion chutney. It was juicy, but dense. The herbed fries were so good, that they're in my top 5! My Lamburger was on fresh naan with fresh veggies and oodles of tzatziki(as there should be!). It came with housemade chips. They were OK, but the herbed fries were too good not to steal. I'm a fan of lamb and this was doing it for me. I'd get this again. At least now I know it's as enjoyable to eat as it to say out loud. :D \n\nThe service was great. The hosts were welcoming and our server was super cool. A chill atmosphere with chill staff. There was live music going on as well, but it was in a different room, so it wasn't super loud. It was played to the rest of the venue over speakers, so you could still talk and not yell.  \n\nLooks like I'll be a repeat customer!", 5], ["I felt like it was really pricey, chicken strips and a cider, for 30bucks!?

We ended up sitting at a long table in what was considered the bar area, yet only 5 feet away was considered table service.  I was displeased that in this area we had go to the bar and to do cash and carry for both drinks and food.  We could have run a tab on credit card, but would have still had to go to the bar for each beverage and food order.  That put a damper on the night and my experience.

At one in the morning a couple friends and myself decided to check out what this place was about. After being carded on the way in, we were seated at a table that seemed like it was last thoroughly cleaned weeks before. Seeing as how it was really busy even at that time, it is probably just a very busy day and night, but at least when wiping down a table when customers leave you would think anything on the table would be shifted so that other people's mess does not just get pushed under everything.

After no help from the waitress, I ended up going with The Staggering Pig with yam frites (well done) because I am always in the mood for some pulled pork, and a Hazelnut Chocolate Ale Beer Float to wash it all down. I had never had a beer float before, but I was feeling a little adventurous that night. To top the late night meal off, I went with the Hazelnut Brownie because...well...it's chocolate!\n\nWhere the chipotle or the coffee porter barbecue sauce was, I couldn't quite tell you. The pulled pork was rather bland and a little bit fatty, yet it was sufficiently moist. So moist in fact that I had to fork and knife it because even the bottom side of the bottom bun was too wet and greasy to handle. Like a roast beef dip, it came with something that was the consistency of jus on the side which is where any sense of flavour was stored, but it was way too thin to really give pulled pork that deep flavour. Some places just can't do it so I can't fault them, but the \"frites\" were not what one would call well done. When I first tasted the beer float, I didn't think much of it was a really weird combination. As the ice cream melted it became much better tasting. By the time I was half done it was actually a really good float.\n\nThe brownie is where they finally won me over. It was actually homemade and really good. Wasn't too rich, wasn't too thick, wasn't too cold; it was a great ending to a mediocre meal. The happy ending and the surprise of a real beer float is what gained them any sort of ranking.

The french onions added a nice touch of flavour. The exotic fried rice was pretty decent. The taro pudding was something special, for $2 I thought it was going to be a tiny thing but there was a good amount! It's not too sweet and has a slightly salty milky cream drizzled over it.

The meal was pretty filling and I particularly enjoyed the soup and the sweet and sour crispy tofu the most. The rice was hot which I appreciated especially because some places serve rice warm and sometimes even cold. What I love about Saigon Lotus is that it omits animal products without being in-your-face about it. The food still tastes good, and sometimes their seitan is made to mimic the taste/texture of meat.

I have yet to meet a dish on the menu I wouldn't rank as being good or that I wouldn't recommend. The staff are super friendly and the interior I find very uplifting and charming.

However I've never not been full after the meals and especially the soups. These meals will leave you satiated and not over stuffed.

I also ordered yam tempura which was very lightly coated, it was served with a mayo based dipping sauce. \n\nThe bad: \nI found 2 little hairs on my yam tempura. I don't want to give them a bad rating because of it, because it was an honest human mistake and they were happy to refund the tempura.

Chow time! \n\nAt first taste, I knew this would be my go-to spot for Pho in Toronto forever more. The bun bo Hue chay had that extra oomph from the spices and lemongrass,  and is topped with the oh-so necessary rau ram (Vietnamese mint) that pairs so well with the flavours of the broth.\n\nFeeling greedy, I opted for the large order and was happy that an upsize meant more soup vs.  more noodles---not because I'm a carb-hater, but because, c'mon, it's all about the broth!\n\nOverall, I'm in love with this place, and am already day dreaming about discovering what else is on the menu.

I mean to me pho is for any time and my comfort food, not only reserved for after clubbing/late night out hangover food. \n\nOh, and don't forget there's no line ups during brunch hours on weekends so a big win.

It's going to take one of the rare spots of being on my regular spots to visit. \n\nEverything we ordered was great. Get the rice rolls!! I can eat a couple plates of this alone.

As a Viet, viet restaurants are a dime a dozen, yet not many left to impress. It could be very much that growing up eating the food of my people left me jaded and hard to please...or simply because knowing how to make the dishes at home it prompts the question, \"why the hell am I paying for that?!\". I am undeniably fugal, especially when it comes to Viet food...I would splurge on sushi, Chinese food, and even fast food...but never Viet food. I unreasonable EXPECT value and quality for the price I am paying, with that being said...\n\nReally this is one of the best I've had thus far. Notable is their quality, I would not hesitate to pay a bit more for this. I am, by all accounts, a carnivore, and if any places that fail to offer meat can still leave me wanting more, it's an A+ in my books. \n\nStarting off with the broth, offered alongside the entrees, there is notable depth and umami taste - it does not taste artificial nor does it have the after effects of the overuse of MSG (as most viet places do). Simple clear broth that just simply delicious. We ordered an order each of Steamed Rice Roll with fresh wild Mushroom, the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu, Seiten and Crispy Roll Bun, and Pho Vegan. \n\n Steamed Rice Roll with fresh wild Mushroom - The taste was outstandingly fresh. Steam-rolls can easily go south if stored improperly or for too long. The shelf of these are not long. These came out perfectly chewy and the \"nuoc mam chay\" that accompanied the dish was just as perfect as it can come close to short of having it made table side. It's the right chewiness and ratio of fillings. My only gripe was the lack of bean sprout and herbs that I've been accustomed to.\n  \nPho Vegan, again with the topping and the broth...it was an absolute delight. It is expected that a vegetable broth will not have that heaviness of the usual beef broth, but it was none the less a pleasure to enjoy.  The noodles were a nice slightly al-dente consistency as I prefer, and topping galore. I would've preferred it even more so if the broth had a more distinguishable taste of PHO (ginger, cinnamon, star anise, etc.) but that's my preference. \n\nLastly, the bun was just mind blowingly delish. Much like the non-vegetarian version, the contrast of the fried and grill topping gave the dish its signature smokey, savoury taste. The lemongrass was quite pronounce and was much appreciated. Once again, the \"nuoc mam\" sauce was very well done. The rice noodle, once again, had a lovely consistent chewiness.\n\nHats off to the chef. I hope that the quality will not deteriorate over time and will definitely be back.

Imperfect Fresh Eats seems to focus on the concept of using imperfect looking produce and oddly shaped items and turning them into the healthy tasty meal without sacrificing nutrition.  This concept also helps to reduce food waste and to lower the overall cost for us!  Sounds great to me!\n\nFOOD (4/5)\nIt's a \"build-your-own meal concept. You can choose either having a bowl or a wrap.  Their wraps are $8 while their small bowls are $9.50 and the large bowls are $11.00. \n\nHow to Order!\nStep 1-  Choose your bowl size.\nStep 2 - Choose your Salad Base: Asian Sweet Potatoes, Black Rice, Spring Mix and Baby Spinach. You can mix all the bases if you like . \nStep 3 - Pick your Protein: Chipotle Chicken, Garlic Butter Shrimp, Kalbi Beef and Lemongrass Tofu.\nStep 4 - Add Toppings.  \nStep 5 - Add Sauces. \n\nI had Chipotle Chicken and  Garlic Butter Shrimp, mixed with all the bases and added all toppings!  It was difficult to decide!  They look fresh, colourful and pretty!  Made me even more hungry when I watch them preparing my meal! \n\nAMBIANCE (4/5)\nI'm amazed by the fast service restaurants these days. They seem to care about their atmosphere and decoration more than before.  Imperfect Fresh eats is one of them. The restaurant theme is based on White & Green Color with the lively green ceiling.   It made me feel like I was dining in the garden.  \n\nOVERALL (4/5)\nIt's a good spot for grabbing a quick lunch to go.  It's healthy and the price is reasonable. I would come back again and recommend it to other people.", 4], ["This place is awesome!\n\nConcept is exactly the same as all the other bowl/wrap places out there. \nYou start off by picking a base and protein but the best part is being able to select as many toppings as you want. I think there are over 15 topping options and several sauces to choose from. \n\nImPerfect is Definitely better than places like Cali love where they limit toppings to two or three. I ordered a small build your own bowl and it was packed to the brim and could easily be split into two meals. There is a large bowl option and you can always pay extra for more protein. \n\nNote: I ordered off Ritual and it was $9.50 for a small bowl last week but the price is now $9.95. Just an FYI although it's still cheaper than other bowl places and I'll definitely go back. Oh yeah, great customer service. Asian woman at the front stopped taking orders to ask about mine when she noticed I was standing in the Ritual pick-up spot for more than 10 minutes. \n\n5 stars.", 5], ["Food is so delicious and affordable if ImPerfect gives out hugs it can replace mom!\n\n$11 a bowl bro! That's really good and it's the large too, never seen anything like this anymore. You get unlimited toppings and are not charged extra. \n\nBowl was super delicious and ingredients are fresh. The owner said he goes to the market to select and buy it himself! No chopped up bagged B.S. like other places.\n\nI highly recommend the sweet potato noodles and the beef protein! The peanut sauce is really good as well.\n\nThis place is getting really popular, order on Ritual ahead to bypass the wait. If this place was closer to me I would go every day. But I go to the Goodlife up the street bro so I can hop on down after I get jacked!\n\nFood: 4.8\nService: 4.8\nAmbiance: 4.6\nValue: 4.9\n===\nOverall: 4.87", 5], ["Was a little disappointed upon entry because they actually don't service a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls :( They should probably take that off of their Yelp page.\n\nWe ended up ordering 2 whole wheat wraps for lunch with chicken, spring mix, lettuce, light chipotle sauce, and other veggies. I expected it to be just a decent healthy wrap, but it blew me away! It took a while for they to heat it up, but when we (eventually) got it, the wrap was nicely crisped on both sides.\n\nI will definitely return for more wraps and maybe even other dishes if I visit Toronto again.", 5], ["Imperfection is beauty and this place is \"picture perfect!\"\nImperfect Fresh Eats, they believe in keeping things simple, fresh and affordable! By using fresh ingredients, every order is customizable to your liking.\n\nStart with wrap or bowl.  Choose a base between sweet potato noodles, black rice, spinach or spring mix, and then add your protein mixture of either chipotle chicken, kalbi beef, tofu or shrimp. Add your choice of wonderful toppings (over 20 to choose from) and you have your own perfectly 'Imperfect' master piece!  \nSuch a great variety. I like the fact that they have cooked proteins. Poki bowl places usually have raw tuna.", 4], ["This a 5 star for tasty meat options, with a great variety of healthy food, at a reasonable price.\n\nA large bowl is reasonable at $11\n\nThe ingredients change depending on what's in season. This was on offer recently:\n\n1. BASE (can choose more than 1):\n- Sweet potato glass noodles\n- Black rice\n- Spinach\n- Mixed greens\n\n2. PROTEIN\n- Chipotle Chicken\n- Kalbi beef\n- Garlic shrimp\n- Lemongrass tofu\n\n3. OTHER TOPPINGS\n- sweet potato mash\n- avocado\n- tomato\n- seaweed\n- pineapple\n- beet\n- cucumber\n- carrot\n- cheese\n- taro chips\n- variety of sauces (peanut sauce was recommended)\netc.\nmany more\n\nThe owners care about the quality of the food and customer satisfaction.\n\nCustomization also means that you need to be a bit careful to make sure that your toppings don't clash", 5], ["Got hooked on this place after giving it a try thanks to their Ritual promo, and I'm glad I did.\n\nNot only is the premise of reducing food waste good, so are their salad bowls! For just $10, you get a fresh, filling, and delicious bowl filled with one or more of your base of choice, along with unlimited toppings.\n\nWill definitely eat here anytime I'm in the area.", 5], ["ABSOLUTELY LOVE ImPerfect Eats and so excited that it's only a 7 minute walk from my MBA classes! Extremely fresh but even more flavourful. We tried large bowls and decided to go for 1) noodles & kalbi beef and 2) rice & chipotle chicken. The bases are 100% gluten free and vegan, which is incredible. Honestly, both were unique in flavour and I'd have a tough time picking which to order again....thank goodness my partner in dine was with me so I could try both. \n\nToppings: So many toppings; a really healthy but deliciously filling meal. Options included daikon, edamame, jalape\u00f1os, and sprouts. They use imperfect produce but literally you can't notice and it taste better than places that I assume use \"perfect\" produce. \n\nSauce: If you don't have any nut allergies I'd recommend the peanut sauce and ginger carrot sauce for the noodles and beef. Really yummy to mix up the flavours if you're adventurous.\n\nService: friendly service and the food is made with love. They explained how it works and made awesome recommendations, especially on sauce combinations. The space is beautiful and full of light.", 5], ["You mention salad, raw and healthy food and I will run the other way so fast that it will surely be a Guinness world book record lol.\nBut then my friends told me they wanted to go to this place for kalbi beef, garlic butter shrimps, chipotle chicken and lemon grass tofu.  I was like, let's go!!  When we got there, I was horrified to discover that they were talking about salad bowls with these ingredients.  But too late to back out, so I ordered a bowl of salad with butter shrimps and kalbi beef.  Then they asked me to choose from a menu what other ingredients I would like for the base.  I ended up choosing everything.  One notable item was patato noodles since I havent tried it before.  Then, just like the way they do it in Subway, you can choose all the veggies and cheeses and I chose pretty much a bit of everything, and then i selected a spicy peanut sauce to top it off,and the server also suggested adding sweet chili sauce to it as well.  All that for just under $10 before tax!  And BAM, best salad ever!  I like how the shrimps and beef were warm.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I begrudgingly enjoyed it haha.", 5], ["Ordered lunch through Ritual. Didn't realize but you can select more than one base, so I accidentally got sweet potato noodles and spring mix, because I didn't unclick on the noodles in the all when I checked off spring mix.  This ended up being a good mistake because the noodles were da bomb.  Many items greyed out and not available; hopefully this isn't a common occurrence (I ordered late lunch, around 130 pm).  Would have liked to try some more of the toppings choices.  The toppings I got were very tasty, especially the lemongrass tofu.  I selected marbled cheese and feta, and these were almost non existent in taste and amount.  I would order from here again though, I always like to try a new place at least twice.  Will report back if my rating goes up or down!", 4], ["Great new place that's opened in Toronto, so much better than Freshii!\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. Fantastic healthy food for a very good price!\n\nThey are really imperfectly perfect! Would reco this to anyone!!", 5], ["I went there with a group of my friends to try their menu and I am glad I did!! It was fresh and delicious!! Selection is pretty straight forward, you choose the size, base, protein then unlimited toppings which is the best part, then the sauce.\u00a0\n\nThere is little price difference between small and large size, I decided on large size. The base can be sweet potato noodles, brown rice, spinach or fresh greens. Since I eat lots of salad on the meals I prepared I decided to treat myself with half sweet potato noodles and half brown rice. Then selected all the toppings which looked really fresh. Staff mentioned that toppings can change based on the season and what is available in the market which makes total sense. At this time some of the toppings were tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, soy beans, avocado, lettuce, spinach, sea weed. I didn't count but they had almost 15-20 different toppings and you can choose as many as you want, they put it on your base. Protein options are beef, chicken, tofu or shrimp. They mentioned that they will add mushroom to the list soon. Again this might change based on seasonal availability. I have chosen tofu. As a final touch I have chosen the ginger sauce which is prepared in house.\n\nAnd now the tasting part!! Sweet potato noodles and brown rice were warm and delicious under fresh toppings. Tofu was perfectly spiced and cooked on the toppings, their special ginger sauce was just yummy!! Overall this bowl got full star from me!! There was plenty of food, even though I was hungry I was full half way on the bowl and enjoyed the rest for lunch next day.\u00a0\n\n\"imperfect eats\" is imperfectly perfect!! What a great concept, using the imperfect produce - meaning broken carrots, small avocados, oddly shaped vegetables. This produce is perfect other than its physical shape, nothing spoiled or expired. First of all this is great environmentally, this place is saving them to be thrown way just because they don't look the right way that we got used to seeing and secondly since they buy these for a cheaper price they reflect the savings to the customers, it is a win-win!! Great initiative !!!\u00a0\n\nI had the chance to meet with owner Jeff who is very passionate about environment and his restaurant.\u00a0\n\nGreat concept and initiative!! It is prized very reasonably compared to the other places around. I highly recommend and will be a regular for sure!!", 5], ["The carnivore friendly salad!\nGreens and protein, perfect combo. \n\nFast checkouts!\n\nThey have a huge selection of toppings. \nStaff are friendly and efficient. \n\nI love that it's straight to the point and not pretentious. \n\nThe concept is quite unique, this place is a gem!\nWill definitely be coming back for more.", 5], ["Yesssss. A salad I can enjoy!\n\nYou pick a bowl (S/L) or wrap, base, protein, and then you have fun choosing up to 20 toppings.\n\nI ordered the large bowl, forbidden black rice, and kalbi beef (meat!!!). \n\nI pretty much ordered all the toppings except bean sprouts and arugula. Thanks for recommending the pineapple, feta cheese (omg yes!) and peanut sauce! Staff were friendly and helped me blend the flavours well. :)\n\nI shall be back!!!\n\n\nNote to self: jaleponos are fresh and spicy. Avoid next time lol.", 5], ["Salads, Acai Bowls, and many more - Imperfect Eats strives to provide all people in Toronto with fresh food, made with imperfect produce. Recently opened for about a month now, Imperfect Eats has been thriving on Adelaide Street to provide healthy and reasonably priced items for its patrons and has attracted a variety of people to its doors.\n\nUpon first entering Imperfect Eats, I was immediately captivated by the ceilings - it was decorated very nicely with bright green vegetation, and bright light bulbs which captured a very fresh essence and ambiance. The inside was nice and polished, with great wall art as well (loved the quote Perfectly Imperfect on the wall!) I had the honour of meeting the owner himself, Jeff Dang, who was very happy to serve my friend and I that afternoon. All the staff were extremely friendly and helped with creating our bowls and wraps that we were going to test try for Imperfect Eats!\n\nThe process to making our bowls was very comprehensive - you'd choose a protein at the beginning (some of the choices included Kalbi Beef, Chipotle Chicken, and Garlic Butter Shrimp) your base (which includes things such as spring leaves or glass noodles) and garnish this with a variety of different options, such as cucumbers, taro chips, fried onions, scallions, pickled carrots, sweet potato, edamame beans - you name it! Nearby the station was also a cute water station where you can get some fresh water that was garnished with limes for taste and scent. Once you've chosen the proteins, base and garnishes, it's all topped off with your choice of sauce - a popular choice of sauce was the Spicy Peanut, Ginger Carrot or Chipotle; it really depends on what kind of bowl you make! Be sure to ask the staff for suggestions, they are always eager to help you make the perfect lunch for you!\n\nMy friend and I, once we got our bowls and wraps made, took a seat in the dining area and began our little feast! I loved how the bowls turned out, it simply screamed \"healthy\", \"colourful\" and of course, delicious!\n\nMy bowl consist of Garlic Shrimp, Edamame Beans, Tomato, Pickled Carrots, Cucumber, Glass Noodles, and Spring Leaves, topped with Spicy Peanut Sauce. This was such a delightful dish - I really enjoyed the peanut sauce mixed in with all the healthy veggies. In addition, the different textures of the bowl really added to the dining experience -from the crunchiness of the fried onions  to the softness of the sweet potato, this bowl really packed a filling meal for myself.\n\nI would say that I wish that Imperfect Eats would be a bit more generous with the proteins, as I felt that there was an uneven ratio of proteins to everything else. As well, the beets that I had also added to my bowl was a bit too earth tasting to me, so unless you like that kind of taste I wouldn't recommend adding it to your bowl.  However, it was a great dish to eat!\n\nMy friend had similar garnishes as mine, adding Taro Chips into hers and minus the Edamame Beans. She also had a different protein, which was the Chipotle Chicken. Overall she seemed to have no complaints, and mentioned that she really enjoyed having the ambiance we did because it really added to the freshness of the bowl for her.\n\nLastly, we were also given some wraps. I actually ended up packing the wraps to go, just because we ate so much in our bowls! However when I had the wraps later, it really still kept its freshness! I did enjoy the beef in my wrap - however I think that my favourite protein from Imperfect Eats has got to be the Garlic Shrimp. It was just so rich and really captured some great flavour for anyone looking for something to remember.\n\nImperfect Eats has been a great addition to the food scene here in Toronto, and I would recommend anyone whose looking for something healthy yet filling to give Imperfect Eats a try!\n\nFor the full review, check out foodieutopia(dot)com/imperfect-eats", 5], ["Tried this out with the $5 off ritual deal and was not disappointed! I thought the small was already a very generous portion that I could barely finish. I love how protein is included and you can have as many other toppings as you want. Good place to stop by for a healthy meal!", 4], ["We've been here twice now, and overall it was a great experience. The food is delicious, and lots of great options for toppings. The staff is friendly and the decor is bright and inviting. \n\nWe ordered in Ritual both times, and the first time they missed a couple toppings on mine, but they were really nice about it and added the missing toppings. The second time they got the order right, so probably just a one - off :)\n\nWill definitely be back!", 4], ["I love this place! I like how they use imperfect fruits and vegetables as the ingredients for the salads, and they have very reasonable prices. The interior is clean and nice, there's seating if you wanted to eat instead of take out. Highly recommend this place for lunch!", 5], ["Accidentally stumbled on this \"hole n the wall\" gem... the storefront is so small, that if you walk by too fast, you will miss it. But what Perfectly Imperfect lacks in size, it makes up for with great service and great food! Hate the fact that I live almost 2,000 miles away. Would definitely become a regular if I was a Toronto local.", 5], ["They got me at Unlimited Toppings!!!!\n\nDecor 5/5\nOmg the ceiling is so beautiful!!!!! Definitely should go there for the instagram people!!!\n\nFood 5/5\nThe most flavourful salad Ive ever had! \nI love love love their warm protein made per order. This is the first salad store i tried that does not use cold chicken. \nTheir peanut sauce is a hit! I also like the ginger carrot sauce! \n\nPrice 5/5\nMost affordable one around the area to be honest!

I wanted matcha or earl grey, but neither came with dark chocolate (matcha comes with milk chocolate, earl grey is white chocolate). So, I ended up getting the pure dark chocolate fondue. It came with two small dishes of strawberries, bananas, and pineapples, as well a slice of brownie and some waffle bites. The waffle bites were really disappointing as they were cold! It was really bad. The fruit was okay but clearly not the freshest, and the brownie was tasty but a tad sweet. The chocolate was good but also a bit sweet; at least it was thick and tasted like chocolate though! The cup it comes in is very deceiving, as there's only a shallow bit of actual chocolate. Service was completely lacking, and the ambiance was alright as it wasn't too loud to have a conversation. At around $13 (CAD), it was expensive for the quantity and quality of food, and the chocolate was just okay.", 3], ["I had been craving fondue and with so few places in Toronto that explicitly offer it, we decided to stop by here after going axe throwing nearby. It was a surprisingly quiet Friday night at 9PM, and it started to get more busy by the time we left closer to 10PM.\n\nI have been to their STC location and had a pleasant experience so I had high hopes for the OG location in historic distillery district! I'm glad to say that my expectations were met and my fondue cravings were definitely satisfied! We ordered the black sesame hot cocoa ($6.25) and the black and white double portion fondue ($18.25) \n\nThe hot cocoa had a hint of sweetness and the black sesame taste was pretty pronounced; a perfect drink for a warm day! I probably wouldn't order this again though as I prefer it to be more sweet to satisfy my sweet tooth haha. The black and white fondue is essentially dark chocolate fondue with a swirl of white chocolate fondue, comes with your signature Cacao 70 accompaniement of assorted fruits, belgian waffle, and brownie bites. The fondue was smooth and the fruit was fresh and sweet. However, I enjoyed dipping the crispy waffles in the fondue the most! My only nitpick would be to have a more even portion of dark and white chocolate rather than just a swirl of the white.\n\nThe customer service was pretty friendly and attentive, and we got our order relatively quickly (drink first, then fondue). Overall, this place is a classic to try out if you either a) love chocolate, b) would like to have a shareable dessert with others, c) would like some brunch/cafe food or d) all of the above!", 4], ["I had the mudslide drink which is basically a vanilla milkshake with baileys, khalua and vodka. ABSOLUTELY ravishing. My phone died so no pics taken. The service could have been better. The server seemed a bit indifferent to helping us or taking our orders and though we weren't in a hurry, neither was he. It was a bit off putting. But overall loved the drink there and if definitely come back for another", 4], ["I'm quite a big fan of this restaurant and especially the location/ambience. It's the perfect end to a day/evening spent at the distillery! \n\nI've been here a couple of times and tried various things on their menu..all of which are quite good! This place is a chocolate lovers paradise! \n\nSome of the menu items I like best: \nChocolate fondue- comes with assorted fruit for dipping and serving size is big enough for two people to share easily. 5/5\n\nWaffles: crisp, light and fluffy. Plenty of options for toppings based on your preference. And the ice cream and melted chocolate come on the side to indulge as much or as little as you like without making the waffle soggy. 4/5\n\nCrepe: I wasn't too much of a fan of. It was a little on the chewy side and hard to cut through. I'm not sure if that was due to the fruits inside or just the quality of the batter. But have definitely had better crepes than this. 3/5\n\nMolten lava cake: I absolutely love this! It's my comfort food for a cold winter day. Hot lava cake with oozing chocolate and a side of ice cream to balance out the sweetness (if needed). 5/5\n\nTheir milkshakes, sundaes and hot chocolate options are also pretty fancy! But very sweet! I would only recommend those if you have a sweet tooth, else it might be hard to finish off. 3/5\n\nStaff is attentive, water refills prompt. A bit of a line up but line moves fairly quickly. First come first serve, don't take reservations at this location.", 4], ["If you love chocolate then you will love this place. It has the variety that you want with the chocolate you crave. \nLucky for me I came to try this out on probably one of the coldest nights, which means no line to get in. Totally worth it. \nI had the Mexican hot chocolate which I now crave and the strawberry goat cheese salad. Both very delicious for different reason. The salad was huge and I couldn't eat it all. Service was fast and friendly and I highly recommend checking this place out.", 4], ["Probably because of the Toronto Christmas Market, but this location near the west entrance of the Distillery District is always jam packed whenever I pass by. Finally decided to come in and give this a try this past Tuesday after 9 pm when the market was already closed for the day and surprisingly the wait for seats was still 35 minutes!\n\nFriendly staff. The space is very colourful and full of warm colours. I did not want to wait that long, so I ordered a dark hot chocolate to-go, since only beverages are available for take-out. \n\nThe service itself was fast and the quality of my drink was worth the $8.50 (besides the location) for the large. I would come back whenever I am in the Distillery District next. Take-out seems to be the most logical here unless it's outside of peak season. \n\nFortunately for me, there is a location conveniently located inside STC, so I'll probably go to that one more.", 3], ["This is my first time visiting the famous cacao 70.  We went for our 11 year anniversary.\n\nWe loveddddd the desserts.  We had the waffle with ice cream.  The waffles were absolutely delicious. Not store bought but dense and amazing.  We also had the fondue for two. My kids inhaled the entire platter.  Portions and prices reasonable.  We will be going back.", 4], ["If you love chocolate then you will love cacao 70.  They range from fondues to cake and more.  They also have a brunch menu.  For me it's alright, a little too sweet for my tastebuds and price wise it's pretty high but if you love chocolate then you will enjoy this place.", 3], ["I've been to this Cacao 70 location twice since it is conveniently located in the Distillery District where I live. Every time I go it is absolutely PACKED but I honestly don't see the hype apart from the fact that it's in the Distillery District lol. The prices are decent but I could probably make a Nutella and Banana Crepe with ice cream at home that tasted just as good. \nEvery time we have gone, we have needed to wait for a seat.\nAll in all, I've heard that they have good hot chocolate which I plan to try next time - maybe then I will consider giving this place a 4 star. For now, it shall remain a 3 star since it isn't anything special and the wait time is just too long! You can find MUCH better dessert at Roselle which is not much further (but a bit away from the Distillery District)", 3], ["The distillery district is so beautiful, and I love that I get to venture in there everytime I feel like visiting Cacao 70. We ordered the Earl Grey Chocolate Fondue and it was INCREDIBLE.  I wish I could eat this everyday. It was so good I wish it didn't have to end. The fondue is white chocolate with a hint of earl grey. This set normally comes with a bowl of brownie bits, but we substituted it for more fruit. 10/10 would recommend. Can't wait to go back!!! I've only ever been to this one location so I am curious to see what the other ones are like. I have walked past the Downtown Markham location but it always looks dark and uninviting.", 5], ["This was a really fun stop on our trip of Toronto. We really enjoyed the fondue experience. The chocolate is quality. I loved the sugar  roasted bananas.", 5], ["Was expecting this place to be a lot busier given the Christmas market.   The staff here were really great.  They found us seats as quickly as they could and offered a high chair for my daughter.  Believe it or not I don't find many restaurants that pay attention to your needs.  Service was quick and efficient .  The staff were great.  We ordered a Mexican hot chocolate and a ham and Swiss panini to share.  Everything was good and no complaints.  Based on the service alone I would return.", 5], ["Such a perfect find! I got the Ham It Up crepe (ham, red pepper, mushroom, cheese, and pesto) and it came with a nice little salad.

Check this place out!", 5], ["Who doesn't like chocolate?\n\nComing there in to distillery District And not having some chocolate is a shame. \n\nMy favourite dishes the classic chocolate fondue. But this time I actually ordered the chocolate Smore's.\n\nThere is typically a wait here. So expect to wait anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to get a table.\n\nShakes are good. Coffee is nice. Pricing is reasonable. And definitely bring friends since it was too much chocolate for one person to eat. Can't believe I just said that. \n\nService tends to be really good. And you typically Internet of this place within an hour.\n\nHighly recommended if you never have tried this place.", 5], ["I've read good things about this place online so I decided to try it after having dinner in the Distillery District.  My girlfriend and I weren't here for very long but we decided to try their triple chocolate cake after reading the description.  We did expect it to be served in a sundae glass but we appreciated the cool presentation.  It was definitely as delicious as described on the menu!  I'm a huge chocolate lover so I definitely wasn't disappointed.  Loved the chocolate sauce and cream and I especially loved the little chocolate balls included in the dessert.  The restaurant itself wasn't too packed and service was reasonably quick.  I will definitely stop by again to try a few other things on their menu!", 5], ["Amazing waffle cone- it was so fresh and delicious. Everything was in a perfect ratio to one another too. Completely recommend the s'mores.", 5], ["It's hard to give a good recommendation to this place yet but I will be trying after only one visit. \n\nI am not a chocolate person and I am not a huge fan of overly sweet things. Things just to keep in mind. The location we visited is in the distillery district. We got the individual chocolate fondues in earl grey and matcha. \n\nThe fondues from out taste is that they are most likely white chocolate as they were on the sweet side. There is a good portion on brownies bites, waffle bites, strawberries, bananas, and pineapple. It give a good balance to the experience. I found the brownie perhaps unnecessary unless you're going to get a more bitter or dark chocolate fondue (which we did not). The rest went well with the fondue, the tartness of the fruit helped to cut the sweetness. The earl grey flavour comes though much better than the matcha does due to the sweetness. \n\nI think there is promise to the food here and we will likely come back to try one of the fondues for two sharing plates. \n\nThe service was relatively quick despite the busy nature of the store. They had a bench seating area for you to park you butt as you waited to be seated at a table. The servers are attentive enough and don't hover. Our server actually rushed over to us as we made our way to pay at the counter. It was endearing and you can see the effort they put into trying to be there for you despite the lack of staff.", 4], ["My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place while we were walking around the Distillery District. Now, I absolutely love chocolate--dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate (yes, yes, I know it's not really considered chocolate)--it all tastes good to me. So, you can imagine my excitement for a place that prides itself on \"showcasing chocolate in all kinds of fun and surprising ways.\" Unfortunately, that's where my excitement ends. My order of the classic (dark) chocolate crepe and espresso with ice cream was so run-of-the-mill. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad food, it's just underwhelming. The only reason I'm giving it three stars, instead of two, is because the service was fast and the person taking our order was friendly, warm, and very attentive. I probably won't be back, but if you're into chocolate, you might as well give it a shot.", 3], ["There are a few locations in the GTA, but this one is tucked away in the Distillery District - a quaint place to enjoy either a sweet or salty dish. I opted for the salty dish, which was the Strawberry & Goat Cheese Salad.

The chef coated the rim and bottom of the glass with your choice of chocolate, this way you are able to taste your chocolate before the hot chocolate mixture hits your palette. I don't recall what type of chocolate they used in the mug, but the moment you pour the it in, you are supposed to stir and mix both types together. I have to say despite the $10 price tag, this was delicious and I've never had hot chocolate like this before. It was perfectly rich, thick and creamy. Just like the description on the menu, the Peru cocoa was not too bitter nor sweet, yet had a fruity note aftertaste which was quite unique!\n\n-Classic Chocolate Fondue (fresh fruits, chocolate brownie bits and classic waffle bites to dip in dark chocolate) - $11.25/Single\nThe chocolate was really rich and smooth.

A glass full of shortcake cubes, fresh strawberries, their signature strawberry sauce, and whipped cream. I was disappointed. We also had a strawberry cheesecake crepe ($17.95) it was better than the shortcake, but remember we paid six dollars more for this. \n\n\nOverall, I will not return to this place because I can get better crepes and cakes at a cheaper price in downtown or uptown.

Definitely worth putting my lactose-sensitive belly through this haha\n\nDESSERT PLATTER (3.5/5) -this was interesting to try.

As an example: In most cuisines, you will not see such a liberal use of pomegranate seeds. The Persian love affair with pomegranates are another story, but know that they are fruit native to India, which was later cultivated in areas such as Iran.\n\nThe Persian Empire, predating the Greek Empire, had a broad reach (China and India were both partners) - and it was through both trade and conquest, that it has become what it is today. Iran occupied an important place on the Silk Road, and this played a large part in evolving their cuisine. Iran also has had heavy influence from the the Muslim conquest, something that is still apparent today. \n\nGiven all this, and our relatively strong Persian immigrant class, I am often disappointed by the lack of good Persian food in the city. Pomegranate, and its two sister restaurants, do a wonderful job of changing this. I particularly have a difficult time finding a restaurant that serves a more diverse array of foods than just 12 types of kebabs. \n\nPomegranate is in a great area of the city for food, and as a consequence, I have been here a few times. Each visit has been a pleasure. Dishes are beautifully aromatic, and the taste does not disappoint. Persian food can be a tad unusual for those who are not used to Arab food, especially given the sweet notes which often characterize the dishes, but these are usually the unique features that distinguish this cuisine. \n\nThese three restaurants: Pomegranate, Sheherzade, and Takht-e Tavoos, are fantastic and important for this city.

You need to get it for sure!", 4], ["Had been there before a few years back and I remembered it being a nice enough experience. Went back this week and it was a mess. There's a strange split of responsibilities, only one of the staff can take drink orders, only one of the staff (different from the drinks person) can take your food order or even tell you what the specials are, and then there's a third person who mostly seemed to walk around scowling and bringing food from the kitchen to the tables.\nWe waited about 15 min to even be asked what we wanted to drink, at which point we were more than ready to order, but we couldn't because we then had to wait for the right person to order our food from. Convoluted, right?\nThe young scowling girl dropped the food on the table with zero acknowledgement that there was a human interaction going, no words, no attempt at making space on the table, no eye contact, no \"do you have everything you need\"; she was very clearly in a terrible mood and I hope she's feeling better now, but that was terrible. She never came back to refill our waters and when she came with the main course, again she just avoided eye contact and sulked.\nTook a while to get the bill too, because again we had to wait for the right person.\n\nFood was tasty, but honestly not enough for me to go back because everything else was an ordeal.", 2], ["Been coming here for years and the quality has been consistently amazing. Had the lamb shank last night with some Kash ke bademjaan which has come to become my favorite dip. Tried to dolmeh for the first time as well! The service was excellent given a busy Saturday evening crowd.", 5], ["Words of advice: Make sure you come with a reservation! Having a table beside the door, we saw probably 10-15 groups attempt to get a table without reservation and we heard the bad news each time \"Sorry, our wait list is full ...\" It was also a Friday night so perhaps less busy during the weekdays.\n\nAnyways, I appreciated the authentic decor in the restaurant which came through in the food as well.  I ordered the charred eggplant and tomato dip which came with warm flatbread for dipping.  Great flavours and while there was a warning about it being mildly spicy, I wasn't bothered by any spice (I don't like spicy food).  We shared the apricot and chicken stew, which came with a huge plate of rice with lentils and a side salad.  We ordered another plate of rice with pomegranates and lentils (not realizing the stew was accompanied by so many sides)!  The stew was very sweet with full apricots.  I would have preferred some additional chicken in the dish (or if the stew itself was bigger)!  So many of the dishes on the menu looked so interesting, it was tough to narrow down the choices being just two diners.", 4], ["Delicious. Healthy, authentic complex flavours with all the right spices and tangy notes. All entree dishes came with salad(s) and rice! My friend and I made a reservation Friday evening, and both the restaurant and our bellies were full by the time we left! Would definitely come back and recommend to friends for Persian cuisine :)", 5], ["This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Every time we visit we try to get a reservation in advance (we are not always lucky, and those visits suck). They have an amazing menu, and their specials are so unique and delicious!\n\nEvery aspect of dining here is excellent. The decor, music and ambiance transport you to the middle east and create an exotic backdrop for your dining experience. \n\nThe service is solid, even when they are very busy (which is pretty much always). Every time we have dined here we have been one small table in a full dining room, with only two servers working the room. Amazingly the food comes out pretty fast, and the servers are very attentive. \n\nOn my last visit, we were there for Valentine's weekend (the weekend before Valentine's day). Not only was the place totally packed, but we witnessed 6 couples get turned away because reservations were full. So, reservations are HIGHLY recommended. \n\nI have eaten most things on the main menu, but here are the stand-outs for me personally:\n\n--The 'noon-o paneer-o gerdu' appetizer is so delicious! Enough for two people to share, it is basically, olives, cheese, herbs, walnuts and bread. I try to take a little of everything in each bite to savor how the flavors all meld together. This appetizer, versus some of the others, which are mostly dips, has more depth and complexity, with a variety of textures and ways to combine the various items on the plate in each bite, which means as you eat through it, you can constantly experience something new. Love, love, love.\n\n--The 'fesenjaan', which is a traditional walnut-pomegranate stew with chicken (you can also get a vegetarian version) is amazing. When the nightly specials don't grab us, this is our go-to. The portion is generous, and you get their saffron rice and a side salad on the plate. The entire dish is a feast for the eyes as well as your taste buds. If you aren't sure what to get, get this.\n\n--The 'baqali polo' is basically the Pomegranate-version of braised lamb shanks. The shanks are cooked to perfection, meat falling off the bone, and the rice, combined with the dill and fava beans provides a rich, tangy and just delicious backdrop to the velvety meat. Yum! Makes my mouth water now, weeks later. \n\nWhatever you do, MAKE SURE you leave room for the ice cream at the end. They have this rosewater-saffron-pistachio ice cream which is a great way to end the meal. The serving is large, definitely enough to share. And it is really well balanced between the rose water and saffron flavoring. \n\nPomegranate also has a great wine list, and the servers are extremely knowledgeable: tell them what you like or ask them to make a recommendation. We have always been very pleased.\n\nLast comment, and perhaps the most important for those of you looking for an outstanding dining experience without breaking the bank: this place is a GREAT value. Most dishes are $16 or under, and for the amount of food you get, the atmosphere and food quality, there is just no way to go wrong. Don't forget to make your reservation though!", 5], ["Went to Pomegranate after several years. Last time we went there was more 7 years ago so I was very excited to go back. In case you are not familiar with Persian food, the dishes in general can be divided into two main categories. First, the bbq skewered meats or Kabobs (which is the majority of Persian restaurants and are what people eat when they eat out back home). The other category is the stews and slow cooked meals which are usually the homemade dishes and everyone likes their mom's version. The food at Pomegranate is of the second category. They offer a variety of stewed dishes and they do a great job at that. I'm not going to say I am blown away by the food and flavors because mainly I am used to the way my mom cooks these dishes but the food is definitely good enough to remind me of a meal at a favorite aunt :)\nAnother reason I like Pomegranate, is the atmosphere and decoration with Farsi scripts and poems with many traditional paintings giving the place a warm and cozy feeling. \n\nFood: 4/5\nPrice: 4/5\nAtmosphere and service: 4.5/5\nOverall: 4/5", 4], ["Have been here many times and came back tonight. The value is undeniable. Menu is small but authentic and difficult to choose from with each delicious option. Any lamb dish will be sizeable, tender and delicious (specials included). \n\nHave had the fesanjaan several times and it's rich and tasty. If your looking for something light - avoid that one. Have had the dessert but I would go elsewhere. Fortunate we have places like this in Toronto and we should support them.", 5], ["This was my first time trying Persian food at a restaurant.The portions are huge for the price and quality of food is amazing. I just wished they used more saffron for the rice because I couldn't taste it at all. I got the Fesenjan, it was really good and other people at the table really like the lamb shanks. Noon-o-paneer-o gerdoo was a really good choice for appetizer (it was flavourful, healthy, and light!). For dessert, the ice cream is completely frozen, so you will have to wait a bit for it until you can use your spoon. It's extra rich and you can really tell that it's homemade. \nThe restaurant got packed at around 7:00 pm (we went mid week) and there was a line-up for the tables so make sure to make a reservation in advance!", 4], ["I ordered the fesenjaan with chicken for my entree, and had the rosewater ice cream for dessert (pictured below).\n\nThe fesenjaan is a thick pomegranate and walnut reduction; not soupy like a stew or curry, but not solid either. Its texture was slightly granular and pasty (courtesy of the walnuts). The taste was decidedly unpleasant. The individual ingredients on their own would probably have tasted better; together, it became a blend of poorly paired flavors that didn't complement each other. The chicken was over cooked and dry, the reduction was dry, and the rice was dry. At least it was a large portion!\n\nOn the other hand, the rose water ice cream was tasty, not dry, and had nice presentation. My complaint with it was that it was entirely frozen when it arrived, and as such was difficult to eat. My girlfriend and I had to wait for it to melt sufficiently to actually try it at all. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere is pleasant, with an option for one party to dine on a Persian-style bed or divan of sorts. The service was decent, if somewhat inattentive at times. Also, having different servers for drinks and food seems like overkill, and was confusing.", 2], ["Wonderful little restaurant in Toronto. The food is delicious and the one item regardless of how full you are is the Rose Milk dessert.  Beautiful and delicious.  Enjoy!", 5], ["Definitely my favourite Iranian restaurant. It serves perfect Persian stews and flawless appetizers. I do recommend its Fesenjan for the main dish. Its daily specials are also worthy of try. The Akbar Mashti ice-cream is a Must for dessert if it is your first experience with the Persian cuisine. Its decor and its hommy-tasted food make this  restaurant really unique. My only reason of not giving it full stars is the arrangement of its tables which is so dense and sometimes makes the guests uncomfortable.", 4], ["Both Pomegranate and Sheherzade, two doors down, are owned by the same family. They are both Persian restaurants but serve different styles of food.\n\nThis location offers you more traditional home style Persian cuisine. The kind of food you would find in someone's home over in Iran. Alternatively, their other location serves the kind of street food you would find in a bazaar.\n\nThe food is truly great at both of their locations and you will see that the owners of these two restaurants are super passionate about the food from their home country.", 4], ["Uggggggghhhhhh yes oh my god yes yes yes the lamb stew blew me away the food here is so good I wanna cry.

I ordered the morasa polo bc I love lamb but really all the the dishes tasted amazing. We were a party of 6 so each of us ordered different entrees. Also tried a bunch of apps.

I've had better Persian meats in California than their restaurant next door but definitely sample their jeweled rice dishes here!", 5], ["We went here for some high quality pub food and we were not disappointed. I had the \"spicy\" carrot soup which was not spicy whatsoever. However, it was creamy, tasty, and thick. The fish and chips were very delicious. A classic done very well. Service was great. Staff was attentive and helpful. I would come here again.", 4], ["Ordered half dozen oyster but only five very small ones and the sixth one only shell with garlic on top... \n\nFood portions are small.

It's pearly an after work spot but also seemed to have a real community vibe in the middle of yorkville. It's in a trendy brownstone right downtown with FIL lighting and industrial meets vintage interior. They have great variety of gin drinks and the fish and chips smelled heavenly and was clearly very popular since everyone around us got it! We got the lobster pie and the duck. My companion said his pie was amazing and left not a drop on the plate. The duck was cooked a bit more then imposed to personally but was a solid medium on a bed of beans. We went for desert, I got warm toffee cake which was a unique and delicious choice! Would absolutely recommend to anyone in the air for good vibes, good food, and the feel of a classy experience in yorkville for a reasonable price.", 5], ["We came here for lunch on a weekday. It wasn't busy but our food took a really long time.  I ordered the Fish and Chips and it was really good.  My boyfriend ordered the buttermilk chicken with coleslaw. The coleslaw was very vinegary and saugy. I did not like the coleslaw.  The buttermilk chicken was crispy, not oily, and delicious.  My fish was crispy and the fish was thick and meaty.  \n\nTheir tartar sauce and ketchup were home made. They were delicious. \n\nThe only con about this place was the price. My fish and chips was $20 and the buttermilk chicken was $24. Food took forever so it was tough during the lunch time on a work day.", 3], ["Really good but busy weekend brunch spot - serving pub fare - in Toronto's upscale Mink Mile neighbourhood. Service was great and food was served up quickly. I was there at 10:00 on a Sunday, sat down, had some water, blinked and the place was buzzing with people all of a sudden. \n\nI suggest you make reservations and probably in advance for brunch - I haven't been for dinner but it's probably a good idea to book ahead of time.\n\nOk, back to the important stuff! The food. The presentation of the food was a bit lacklustre but it was tasty which is really what it's about. I had the cranberry walnut French Toast, because, why not? It was two slices of toast covered in maple syrup (and ice cream and maple butter - I can't have ice cream but if I could I don't think I'd have it at 10:00am, maybe that's just me) anyhow, the French Toast was pretty good. It was sweet, crunchy and the hit of walnut and cranberries was unexpected but pleasing. I was glad it was only two slices- perfect amount for me. \n\nThe service was efficient and our server was very attentive, making sure we were seen too right when sat down, that we had everything we needed as we were served and topping up our coffees. Love a place that pays that much attention to their guests! \n\nI think I will go back for dinner sometime.", 4], ["Sunday afternoon, dearth of decent bars in the neighborhood. Wandered on over to this pub - a classic English watering hole including the furniture and bar taps.\n\nSettled at a table, dimly lit with a lamp to the side (perfect). Was quickly given menus by our server (not very pub-like) which includes some interesting options. Decided on the Pressed Beef Tongue Chips ($7) to go along with a pint ($8.25). The \"chips\" are a handful of well fried beef-tongue bites served alongside mustard aioli. Wonderfully breaded and the aioli provides a nice kick. Kinda wished there was more, but it kept the dish cheap.\n\nService is quick and the space was nice to relax. Good spot to drink and talk with friends.", 4], ["I came here on a Sunday to grab brunch with a friend. We seen the reviews on YELP and it was just a couple feet away from where we were. \n\nThe outside of the restaurant was so welcoming. I loved the red building and the decor. Gorgeous patio, too bad it was way too cold to sit outside. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were waiting for awhile to be seated. We thought that was super odd since we kept making eye contact with three other servers and the bartender. Nothing says awkward when customers are waiting to be seated and the servers/host are just standing behind the bar for a couple minutes exchanging glances. My friend said \"you think we be seated by now....\" and I agreed with her. After 5 minutes, the host leaves her spot from behind the bar and asked if we had reservations. Please keep in mind that she wasn't doing anything behind the bar and took that long to come greet us. Not cool. \n\nWe didn't have reservations but she finally seated us down. From there, it was the male french server that turned our experience from blah to great. HE WAS AWESOME and totally made us forget about our horrible experience with the blond host. He told us his name was Anthony, told us the changes in the menu and was super quick and efficient. \n\nI ordered the eggs benny with Peameal. For 17 bucks in a brunch place that is located in Yorkville, that is reasonable to me. I thought there would be some kind of hash or potatoes with it. It was still delicious. I wouldn't order it again though, it was a different take of eggs benedict that I wasn't used to. The hollandise sauce tasted differently and the consistency was a bit thicker. The poached eggs and peameal was served on two halves of a scone. It was yummy, but next time I will try something else. I should have gone with the fish and chips! \n\nMy friend ordered the full breakfast. She had no complaints, and it was super filling. \n\nI didn't think it was necessary to book reservations, there was several empty tables available so I was really puzzled to why we weren't seated or greeted right away.

It's a beautiful restaurant with an even more gorgeous back patio. The style and design just fits. The old clock in the back is a nod to the past yet the style of the patio keeps it modern and looking to the future.\n\nHowever, the dining experience wasn't the very best. The service was a bit slow and the food was not good. We ordered Scotch eggs and they came out cold and not tasty at all.\n\nThe drinks were decent.

Glad I got the smaller portion as it was very rich! To drink, I was nicely surprised be the incredible flavor of the Monarch. The cilantro was a strong and refreshing, but only for those who enjoy the herb! Also tried a pint of the cask ale; it's so rare to find a place serving cask ales, none the less three options. \n\nBoth nights the staff was incredible. The waitress was attentive but not overwhelming. Same for the bartender tonight. \n\nWill definitely be back next time I'm in Toronto.", 5], ["I came here for brunch on a Saturday with some family friends, and was pleasantly surprised. The Oxley unlike its surroundings offers it a cozy pub-like environment with delicious food. Two people in our group ordered the burger, and had nothing but good things to say about It. It came with a side of big thick hand cut fries. I myself ordered the hollaindaise spinach and mushroom scones and although delicious, I wish there was more! My plate was a little underwhelming for the $14.00 I paid. My other friend ordered the Big English and was happy with everything she got. \n\nAmbience and Service was ok. It got a bit loud because we were there at a busy time and its very dark and small in the restaurant. \n\nOverall, good experience, I'd likely come back again and be more wise with my choice of food :)", 4], ["Nice.

The food is always pretty good but the service is a real hit or miss - mostly a miss as of late. For the amount you're spending you would think they would treat you slightly better. Maybe fill up your water without you practically begging for it - or perhaps get you the cheque without you having to get up and go hunt down a server - or the very least crack a smile! And God forbid you leave a 15 percent tip even after getting horrifyingly bad service, you'll practically get sneered at while you walk out the door", 2], ["We've been to this restaurant twice; both times had very, very poor service. The first time, the waitress literally nudged us from behind to hand over the check. The second time, we waited for over an hour for our simple order of 3 burgers and 3 fish and chips. When our food was finaly served, one of the orders were incorrect. Good food, nice ambiance, but the service was subpar. Explore other options in the area if you can.", 2], ["It's the Keg! What can I say. Even with my varying tastes for fast food and fine dining on the other spectrum, I've always loved the Keg.\n\nThis is a solid location in terms of service and food quality.

Rib steak and filet mignon with twice baked potato are our go to's along with the escargot for appetizer to dip with bread.", 5], ["Only second time coming to this location for mid-week dinner because York St. was unable to book reservations.  Like all other Kegs, they are great value for the money.  Decided to post a review because its easy to forget about this location in the downtown core.  It was not crazy busy and has slightly more relaxed vibe than York St.  \n\nNo surprises with the food (had prime rib classic with wedge salad), it is exactly like other locations so you know what you are getting.  Service was excellent; all staff super friendly. Food was served quickly and wine list has very fair markups (ordered good value Argentinian Malbec blend).  They have it down to a science.  Safe, easy choice for steaks/red-meat dinner.", 4], ["Always good food. And the music. Frankenstein Edgar winter blasting in perfect fine dining lighting. I'm ordering the cannabis steak. \nRock on dudes. The keg is sick. Tom Perry too just the kind of music you want to listen to drinking wine At $17 a glass.

This is music selected by head office.  maybe McDonald will start playing Beethoven.", 2], ["This restaurant was near the neighborhood of the Airbnb I was staying at. I love the atmosphere of the place as it definitely could be a good place to go with friends but also an amazing place for a nice romantic dinner date. The prices are moderate and the food was good. I started with the garlic cheese toast which is basically crack bread. It was so good and so flavorful. Glad I went by myself because I don't think I would have shared it. I ended up ordering Prime ribs with asiago rice and everything was very flavorful.

Service is always great I have never had bad service at this location or any other so well done to all the Kegs I've been to. \n\nI usually go with the Keg classic dinners because it includes my favorite iceberg lettuce salad with bacon and blue cheese. This salad is served with a 1/4 of an iceberg lettuce and can be ordered with either blue cheese or ranch dressing, or you can also order a Caesar salad or garden greens. You can also order your sides such as baked potato, garlic mashed, twice baked potato, rice, or veggies. I got the New York strip today cooked blue rare Chicago style perfectly done.\n\nLike I said it's the Keg can go wrong with anything on the menu enjoy!", 4], ["When you are looking for good steak that's not going to cost an arm and a leg The Keg is where you need to go. Our dinner was at The Keg on the Esplanade downtown Toronto. The venue is fairly large however reservations downtown are still recommended. The steaks are as good and cooked to perfection. You can also ask for the steak to be cooked Chicago Style...(yum yum). My favorite accompaniment is the either the garlic mashed potatoes or if you aren't calorie counting than definitely get the twice baked potato with the Ceasar salad to start. The steaks come with delicious buttery mushrooms. As for the appetizers the must try is the Mushrooms Neptune.\n\nThe service was nice. Our server wasn't constantly at our table hoovering over us which was nice.", 4], ["I love the keg dont get me wrong, today it was a friends birthday on the weekend so we took him to the keg for dinner. I can honestly say this was probably the worst dinner ive ever had at this restaurant. Two of us had the prime rib it came and looked raw on top of that it looked like its been sitting under a heat lamp for a good amount of time.  The birthday boy ordered the baseball sirloin and he said it was like eating rubber.  Im not sure what was wrong with today but man it was such a terrible dinner it is going to make me think twice about going to the keg for a while.

Cheesey toast,   escargot, and the cheese platter all good. As for the steaks... mine was done perfectly. Sirloin 12oz great! Potato done well!

The location was nice and the decor was great. I had a reservation, I called ahead to let them know I'd be 10 min late and the girl told me that it wouldn't be a problem because they hold reservations for 15 min. I arrive there, waited in line to check in and once I do the hostess is very rude and snappy. I felt bad for the girl who greeted us because i could tell she was uncomfortable and she was so nice. The rude host did even look at me but instead told the girl (which both were within arms distance) that we'd have to wait a few minutes. Again I disregarded the rudeness because it was a special night. We waited and finally 15 min later we were seated. Our table was set up beautifully right next to the fire place. We ordered the 32oz Red Sangria which was great. The bread and butter was delicious. My GF ordered the steak and lobster which she really enjoyed but she wish the lobster had more meat, there really wasn't much. I ordered the 14oz Prime Rib and it was the most disappointing steak I've ever had. The first bite and I already knew that it was NOT good. I'm from the US so imagine Outback Steakhouse having better quality steak. I was really bummed out because everything from the table, presentation drinks and waiter's service was really nice but my plate was the biggest let down. The mashed potatoes were alright. I didnt complain to the waiter because again, it was my GF birthday and she was enjoying her food which was really all that mattered to me. 3 Stars for location, decor, presentation and my gf plate. 2 stars for my encounter with the host and my plate.", 3], ["Yesterday was the first time I've ever been to The Keg, and I'm glad I decided to go to this location! \n\nI took my boyfriend here for his birthday.

The lighting is dimmed, but not too dark that you can't see your food or the person you're with. \n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped scallops to start,$12. It was definitely worth it, the scallops were so tender and the bacon was a nice touch. Definitely a unique dish I would recommend. \nI ordered the 10oz Fillet Mignon cooked medium (bacon wrapped) $42, it was really good. I got the twice baked potato on the side, not really a fan of that. I didn't realize it would be that over-baked, I didn't taste much potato, more of a burnt flavour instead. \nMy boyfriend ordered the Sirloin Oscar with garlic mashed potatoes on the side $38, he said it was very good. \n\nThe service here is pretty good. The host working last night was really nice. While walking to our table he asked if we were celebrating anything, and I mentioned it was my boyfriend's birthday. After being seated, I walked back to the front to ask him if he could tell our server we're celebrating a birthday. He said he was already ahead of me and told the server to bring us a free dessert (Billy Miner Pie), how sweet!

The chops were beyond delicious, the root mash was another story, under cooked and a little crunchy... if I was offered that special again I would ask them to sub the garlic mash. \n\nWe also ordered the ice cream cake, maybe it was called billy miner or something... it was REALLY DELICIOUS!!

I ordered the beef sliders with fries & hubby had the burger which came with a side of coleslaw & side of fries. Everything was delicious. That's why I like The Keg.

I had the Nun's Pasta and my friend ordered steak with mashed potatoes. Yes we are aware of the fact that this is a pub, and that pub food isn't typically the best. However, Sin and Redemption is supposed to be a bit more \"elevated\" compared to other bars...we were disappointed to discover that the Nun's Pasta was rather bland, the steak lacked seasoning and that the mashed potatoes were not cooked properly.

They would literally just look at each other and shrug whenever we would look in their direction. I finally had enough and asked \"Can we get the bill!?\" TWICE.\n\n4.

Overall, this place is ok. I might try the kebab plate next time, but what I really like was the deep-fried calamari with tzatziki. They are affordable and really tasty.", 3], ["3.5: Pretty good! $8 for a sit down dinner (the pictured gyro) is pretty good in this neighborhood. The chicken was tender, but the pork was a little gristled, so I think I'd go straight chicken or the lamb one next time. \n\nThe $10 Greek salad was a little disappointing: pretty big hunks of everything, so it was kind of \"do it yourself\", and dressed, but not marinated. \n\nPita with tapenade is the complementary bread - not bad. \n\nFriendly and attentive service.

It was grilled perfectly and with the tzatziki sauce and lemon, it was amazing.\n\nI also ordered the chicken gyro, which after reading all the reviews was a tiny bit disappointing. It was still pretty good but I was expecting it to be one of the best gyros I've had - and it didn't really meet expectations. It was a little bit dry, and the chicken didn't have as much flavour as I thought it would. Maybe it was just because I was so blown away by the calamari, anything I ate after wouldn't have compared. Next time I'm back I will definitely try the lamb/beef gyro.\n\nThe service was great even though it was very busy. I was seated as soon as I got there and my order was taken within a few minutes.

The pitas were a good size and each element within it was proportionate - every bite had a little bit of everything (it even comes with fries in them)! The meat was nice and moist but some pieces were quite fatty (this is the only reason that held me back from giving a 5 star). I can't complain too much about the fat since it's so cheap here, you kind of expect it to happen. They definitely don't skimp on the feta for the Greek fries and salad, super delicious. I highly recommend getting the combination platter ($17.95) found on the last page. You get to pick 2 pitas or meat, 1 salad and 1 side. \n\nSERVICE\nStaff were kind and speedy. The food came out within minutes and our entire order was accurate. They didn't make me feel rushed though it started to get busy. And I really appreciated that they charged us for the combo platter which was cheaper than how we ordered everything separately! This really speaks to their character as they didn't just take the extra money (it would have been $6 more to order everything separately). \n\nAMBIENCE\nThey must have expanded because they are twice the size from what I remember it to be a few years ago.

Maybe if you really enjoy eating lamb you would have loved it. The portions were huge and the price was great and overall the quality was decent as well.

This is a lot of food for 2 people, as they also give complimentary pita bread with an olive spread. This is good if you enjoy olives, otherwise I would skip it as it's very strong in taste! The chicken gyros pita is my go to! It is so flavourful and not dry at all and it has regular fries it in. Here was so much food that  had some leftovers to take home. \n\nThe service here can be a hit or miss, but the last time I went the servers we had were very attentive.

Salad was proper salad, More than usual amount of cucumbers, onions, tomato, decent amount of decent Feta and few olives. Potatoes are seasoned, tasty and comes with a tiny amount of sauce.

We ordered the chicken gyros and the pork gyros. I was expecting to pay at least $20 but, for the two, it cost $9.50. Definitely a great deal. The gyros themselves were okay - I was surprised and excited to find fries in them! The gyros are full and big but both gyros lacked sauce. Lots of meat but they were super dry. Which made me want to stop eating them before I got full. Also - the seasoning on the chicken is a lot better than on the pork. \n\nThat being said, I think I'll have to give the place another chance and hope that their quality is better. If a lot of people eat here, I'm missing something. Plus - all the orders that came past me as I waited for my takeout looked delicious and worth the prices you'd pay for them.

The server will also bring the stone bowl over to the table and will mix it in front of you. \n\nAnnnd the kaarage always hit the spot - the portions are big and it's juicy. They served it with some sea salt but I prefer their mayo more. \n\nBtw, if it's for a special occasion like a birthday, they will serve you an on the house dessert! The matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was really good. \n\nDefinitely will be coming back. Also I think they have specials every week!!", 5], ["We celebrated our 8-year-anniversary at Kingyo. This restaurant has that mood lighting, and is decorated with these old school, gaming console in the wall, they look like pachinko machines, but you can tell that the images come from games like the original street fighter, fatal fury, that era of gaming. \n\nThe menu is a tapas style menus, with specials coming on a separate menu card. We decided for the Prix Fixe menu and added a duck and check breast dish. This was a good amount of food, split between two people. \n\nThe server dropped off the stone bowl with mushrooms. Man this dish was just full of that earthy umami flavour. Its highlighted by that bonito like taste of the sauce, the mushrooms, and then the soft tofu-ey centre of the tofu. We scraped the bowl clean, even just as a first dish. \n\nThis was followed up by the Beef Tataki Salad and the Ahi Tuna Poke. The Salad is a salad, you kinda of lose the beef tataki a little bit. It was hard to split but, I appreciate the bit of green with any Japanese meal, as they are sometimes non-existent. The Tuna Poke was good. Vibrant and fresh. The sauce is deceptive, with the pieces of bread, not an easy time trying to run the bread through it on a flat plate. We devoured the poke and enjoyed the salad. The sashimi followed, and I have to say when you have high quality sashimi that follows more delicious and flavourful dishes, you almost don't remember you ate it. I do remember that the quality of the fish was quite high, the texture and temperature were just right. You get the sweetness of the scallop and the shrimp and the texture hold up for the hamachi, just that bit more of a toothsome feel compared to the salmon or tuna. \n\nThe duck and chicken breast were all good and interesting but are accentuated with the garnishes on the side. These are a must. I will say we were probably starting to get full at this time. I would say this dish was nice, but maybe not one I would get again. The garlic bread was quite large and didn't match the size of the chicken or duck. By this point this was the second dish with garlic bread and these were larger portions than the ones for the poke and they had more garlic butter on them. \n\nHERE COMES THE SHOW STOPPER!!!\nThe wagyu hot stone beef. It is a spectacle, with the smoke hot black stone, like actual rising smoke and steam of this thing. Please tend to the stone when you put the beef one. I feel like the quality was good enough we could have eaten the all raw but we literal just slapped a slice of beef on flipped it and then took them off. The tenderness of the beef is divine. Highly recommend this as part of a meal, definitely not a whole lot of food on its own. \n\nI feel like at this point I'm reliving a chinese wedding menu, because we're now starting to feel the food. The karaage was good but we didn't enjoy it as much as we were hitting a level of fullness that makes the next dish that much more interesting. \n\nThis hot stone bowl uni fried rice, man it was a game changer like the wagyu beef. The server let up photograph the food before mixing it. That UNI, man that Uni just disappear into the rice but you taste it's essence with each bite. It's magical. I mean we were starting to regret life with how full we were, but we would have had a happy death at that point. No regrets. If you're not a fan of Uni or things that taste like the sea, you will most likely not like this. \n\nFinally, even though we were already regretting adding the extra dish, we decided to get dessert. Because you know, you have a separate dessert stomach. The frozen matcha creme brulee caught our eye. It was interesting. Definitely brulee-ed but not very creme? not sure if that make sense. It eats like a melona or something of that sorta. With enough solidness but the cool temperature and the lightness despite being frozen didn't exacerbate our level of fullness. Overall a great meal for a wonderful night. \n\nLooking forward to revisiting this place!!", 4], ["The restaurant is really nice atmosphere and comfortable, dishes are really well presented.\n\nBUT:\n1- Menu is confusing, there is 1 menu and 2 extra \"papers\" with some specials but that is similar to what is in the main menu. The design make it harder to read. I didn't like.\n\n2- Service was OK, the server was there for us, but no patience to explain dishes to us and it makes me mad because I want to know what I'm gonna eat!\n\n3- Pricey! I wouldn't say overpriced, because this place is considered a higher level than regular restaurants. But it's too expensive specially when you see the amount of food that comes, so little.\n\nI left there with my pocket empty and feeling hungry!! - Maybe I eat a lot, but anyway it was not enough. :( \n\nI would recommend JUST if you are in a mood to try new dishes or in a mood to grab few bites while talking to your friends. Don't go too hungry!", 3], ["Halfway through my family's weekend lunch here, we were plotting a trip to Japan. That's how delicious Kingyo is, yo. This is not a joke.\n\nOnce upon a different life I lived in Cabbagetown. As is often the case with previous lives, I don't think of it super often, and when I do it isn't affectionately. If more incredible restaurants like this were lining Parliament street in 2011, I definitely would have looked back on this hood with more love, and returned more frequently. \n\nFollowing a family trip to Riverdale Farm, we popped into this gorgeous Izakaya. I had the ramen and karaage meal and shared it with my daughter. It was perfect, and we both left stuffed. Her obsession with Japanese noodles brings me endless joy, and the flavours at Kingyo are unrivaled. The booths are made of magic, and the details in the ambience are super cool for adults and children alike. \n\nYes, you might have to wait for a table if you don't have reservations, but hell yes, it is worth it.", 5], ["Absolutely love the atmosphere of this place, I would say the food is definitely on the pricier side and they are very small/tapas style portions. So go with a large group and get a bunch of items to try and share. The food is good but in all honesty it's not mind-blowing. Their cocktails and drinks are refreshing but also on the pricier side. \n\nYou're essentially paying for the atmosphere which is 100% worth it! There's also this huge glass table with live goldfish inside and it looks really cool. Would recommend this place if you don't mind spending some money with a large group of people for a new environment.", 4], ["Prefix menu. With another Reman. Everything is excellent. However the stone wagyu beef just so so.", 5], ["Can I say my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the place. \n\n1) Food was so fresh and delicious! The udon and ramen we got were both equally good but I preferred the udon because I like udon better. The sashimi was so fresh and the best we've had in a while (considering we're both from Cali and DC)  which is why we ordered the Chefs choice and followed up with the albacore tuna ! The dessert I almost passed up but I'm glad I didn't because it was unique yet stayed true to Asian flavors (Matcha Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with red bean sauce). I would highly return when we come back in the future.\n\n2) the restrooms had great amenities. Although, a bit dark was clean and added to the ambiance of the place.\n\n3) the servers all greet you at the door and we're super accommodating to when we wanted to order more things. The girl we had was new but super sweet and asked how we liked our food. \n\nIt was overall an enjoyable experience!", 5], ["DINNER\n\nBeen here numerous times and each time was decent.\n\nThis is true Japanese owned and operated so you know its going to be legit. \n\nOrdered the wakame salad, unagi fried rice(special order) , cold ramen noodle (summer menu), pork belly udon and chicken karaage. (See pics for details)\n\nAll dishes were high quality and tasted amazing! Cant wait till I hit up Osaka next year.. until then this place will do! \n\nKeep up the great work! \u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044 oishii!", 4], ["The limited Bento was delicious and bigger portion than I expected.

We ordered a bunch of food so here it goes one by one!\n\nDrinks: I never really enjoy or drink alcoholic drinks but literally EVERY drink I tried here was amazing and I would order them all again. My favorites were the Yuzu gin tonic and the ice peach but the mango calpico cocktail was great too.\n\n1. Yuzu gin tonic \n2. Fresh ginger honey lemon cocktail\n3. Mango calpico cocktail \n4. Ice peach \n5. White wine sangria \n\nFood: The presentation was beautiful for every dish, especially for the Stone grilled beef tongue and the Tako wasabi. \n\n1. Bone marrow\n2. Grilled salmon and ikura don \n3. Chicken karaage w/ magic powder - My favorite! Magic powder....uh yea...totally    magic. \n4. Stone grilled beef tongue - A fun dish where you can cook the beef tongue on a hot rock. \n5. Tako wasabi\n6. Stone bowl pork kakuni don - I would order this all for myself next time. \n7. 2 color almond tofu - Delish. I am the biggest almond lover and would absolutely also order this for myself next time. \n\nKingyo is large and spacious inside. It was hard to flag down the servers when you needed something but they were friendly when you managed to get them. I'm told Kingyo is a bit more expensive than other izakaya restaurants considering the smaller portions but I can't deny that the quality of food is terrific.", 4], ["Ok people...

It has become a regular spot for me now and thought I'd write a quick review. \n\nFood is a little pricey but it's well worth it and the atmosphere is fun, loud and entertaining if you're by the bar.

And don't trust the hostess.", 1], ["I hate to compare it, but being the pioneer of the izakaya movement in Toronto, it's inevitable that we compare all similar Vancouver based restaurants to Guu. KINGYO is like the grown up version of Guu. It's got the izakaya feel and vibe, with a bit of class, quiet, originality and fun. \n\nWe walked in to its high ceilings and blinking antique pachinko machines along the wall and a silent projection of Doremon reaching for his red bean pancake on the wall. This place is going to be fun. \n\nThe servers are extremely attentive, knowledge and friendly. Food came quickly and with good timing between them, not too close together and far apart enough for us to digest. \n\nThe menu has a lot to offer, and lots of unique dishes. Not a lot of fried tempura stuff which is really an easy cop out. \n\nTheir presentation of the food is really nice, with different ways of containing some of the side dishes. Although repetitive with the banana leaf on everything it made for some nice photos. This is like AsiansTakingPhotosOfFood heaven. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- LOTUS ROOT  - Renkon Kimpira (okay, good to share not amazing, not spicy) \n\n- TAKE WASABI, pickled octopus in wasabi to wrap in seaweed (if you don't like wasabi skip this, also if y)ou don't like slimy foods would skip it too) \n\n- SEA URCHIN SHOOTER. I wanted to try this egg with shiso, yam, yuzu and sea urchin.. It's awfully expensive at $7 and really have to be adventurous to like this one. You would be able to share this with a close friend or partner\n\n- STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE ($10) - it's quite gimmicky cooking your own meat on a stone, but it's a great way to impress people who have never seen it before (my first time too). Impressed this rock stays so hot, and almost instantly cooked the thin pieces of meat. A good sharing plate\n\n- BIG SHORT RIB - they weren't kidding, this thing was huge. It came nicely at the end of the meal and filled everyone right up. A sweet and tangy vinegar sauce made the braised meat crunchy, sticky and tender. Get this one.\n\n- PORK BELLY - Cream Buta Kakuni - This had to be the best dish of the night. So fatty it was creamy. But so much flavour it was explosive, almost. Get this too\n\n- CHICKEN KARAAGE - the first dish that landed on our table. Whatever this magic powder is, I want some. At $8, it was one of those that was worth its value for sure. Good for sharing (ask for a knife). Soft and succulent inside, and perfectly crispy on the outside. Get this three.\n\n- KINGYO YAKIUDON - this was off their special menu. I love kimchi udon and since starting to make it at home my husband feels that it's not special anymore and wanted to try something more plain. But this was anything but plain - filled with mushrooms and beef and seasoned with their magic powder (no really, how do I get some of this)\n\n- UNAGI DON - off the special menu - best unagi don I've ever had. something about the unagi mariande gives it a sweet soy based flavour. served in a stone bowl, it was hot and cripsy without me having to leave the rice in there and pressing it so it will cook. \n\n- GRILLED SQUID KABAYAKI - off the special menu - wasn't amazing. It was a little tough, and not that tasty. \n\nWe skipped the sashimi this time because of cost and the fact we wanted to try so many other cooked dishes. Based on the careful preparation of all the food here, I'm sure it will be amazing and worth the price tag. \nThey also have a special vegan menu that is limited and is an all day lunch box. Worth a try for $15\n\nFor dessert, they had only a few. \nALMOND TOFU - soft and silky, but still prefer the one at Guu\nEGG PUDDING - a creme brulee basically, still very good\nCASTELLA SPONGE CAKE - you know the cakes you get from the Korean supermarket. It was this drizzled with some sweet sauce and served with ice cream. It wasn't spectacular. \nWe skipped the dessert on the special menu but maybe we should have gotten that too. \n\nAfter all was said and done, 5 people, a few pints of Sapporo and a bottle of sake with all this food, it all came out to about $45pp which was a lot less than my first outing at Guu.

We both heard good things about Kingyo from different friends that have gone.  The wait without a reservation was only 15 minutes and the hostess was friendly.  The environment was loud even though the wooden benches were spread-out throughout the restaurant.  \n\nThe fresh ginger cocktails and gin-based cocktails were definitely my style.  As we looked at the exotic menu, we found it difficult to make food choices but were fascinated to see the dishes for other tables come out in very fancy plating.  I found the food itself to be extremely disappointing in taste however.  We had a recommended torro and avocado sushi roll, soft-shell crab salad and the chicken wings.  The soft-shell crab and chicken wings were way too salty.  The roll was bland and didn't satisfy.\n\nWhere Kingyo did set a high bar was the women's washroom.  The washroom kept a consistent wooden theme as the restaurant itself and the best part of the washroom (other restaurant owners should take note here) is that they provided little toiletry items such as mouth-wash, feminine pads, cotton pads, nail filers and bobby pins.  In my opinion, every female washroom should have these essentials!  I re-pinned my hair that had been annoying me all night and we set off with me in a little bit of a better mood.", 2], ["I came here with fellow yelper, Vanessa C., for my farewell dinner.

I've never had stone-grilled food before, and this was quite the treat!\n- ABURI TUNA TORO PRESSED SUSHI: It seems like the trend nowadays is to get pressed sushi! It was quite delectable.\n- STONE BOWL SEAFOOD SEA URCHIN DON: Fellow yelper, Justin C., had recommended this to us... But I was quite disappointed with it.\n- RAMEN: Don't get it. I was sad. :(\n- Special: AGEDASHI CHEESE & CHERRY TOMATOES: Initially it sounded pretty disgusting, but the waitress had recommended this, so we had it -- and it was UBER good.\n\nThe food arrived really quickly -- pretty much all in one go. I was sitting there going, \"Oh shoot, do we still have space on our table for all this food?!\" Service was also great -- the waitresses and the hostess were very nice and tried to make conversation every time they came by. However, it was pretty funny when they asked us if we had ever had uni before (and if it's a usual thing to get in Canada). I guess they're new to the country?\n\nFrom my end, I could see the large screen TV playing some cheesy old school Japanese shows. My friend could see the crazy dizzying pachinko machines in the background though, which would've totally given me a seizure.\n\nToo bad I didn't get more of a chance to check out Kingyo before I left for San Francisco! However, definite recommend to all!", 5], ["One of, if not the best Izakaya in Toronto. I have visited multiple times and have not been disappointed. Their Happy Hour menu is also a great deal for beer and oysters. I recommend the Tako Wasabi, Pork belly in hot stone bowl, beef tenderloin on a hot stone, Ebi-shrimp and their pressed sushi. Can't really go wrong with anything here. The prices are very reasonable given the quality of food and pricing of Izakaya food in general in Toronto. Much better than Imanishi, which seems to be gaining in popularity for reasons that I don't understand.", 5], ["I don't usually write reviews unless a restaurant really impressed me or really dissapointed me.\n\nGood: the food was actually good. The decoration was okay and somewhat authentic to the Japanese culture.\n\nBad: the service. For the entire time I was there, I got one smile from the servers. One who didn't even serve us.

The soft shell crab salad was one of my favourites - tangy dressing with crunchy greens, could have used a bigger piece of crab though.  \n\nThe grilled beef tongue was just okay, probably more novelty as you can grill it on a hot piece of stone that accompanies the dish.  \n\nWe opted for a second pitcher of Sapporo rather than ordering dessert.\n\nMy faith has been renewed in izakaya cuisine.

As for the food it was just decent, nothing spectacular. \n\nI ordered the Diced Beef Tenderloin Steak and Ebi-Mayo. I found the tenderloin to be very chewy and I personally felt it lacked flavour considering the fact that I was trying to scrape off the remaining sauce  on the hot plate (Sauce was poured over the meal but I felt like there wasn't enough!). As for the Ebi-Mayo, the spiciness was very overwhelming and kind of destroyed the meal itself. Throughout all the dishes that were ordered that night within the group, the 'A Big Kingyo Short Rib' were the best. The ribs were very moist that it can slide off the bone and the portion was huge. To conclude, the portions of the food I found were really tiny and it was some what overpriced for what you received.

Besides looking at some fabulous and fancy shoes, the museum also displays the functionality of early shoes and talks about what they were made of.

The latter seemed to be the big draw currently, as his work has been prolific and very unique and inspired overall. One particularly cool section displayed the shoes had crafted for the Marie Antoinette film.\n\nIn no way would I consider myself a shoe devotee, but I appreciated what the museum had to offer.

We really combed the place thoroughly, reading every word, and it took almost exactly 3 hours (which is a very reasonable amount of time to spend in a museum). \n\nI really have to hand it to the educational team for the museum, on top of my general appreciation for the place (oh yeah, I really liked the architecture, too). They repeated just enough content that visitors could really learn from the museum, but not in a carbon-copy kind of way that leaves a visitor bored out of their minds. (Every time a duplicate tidbit was presented, it was either in a different exhibit with slightly different information, or in a different context in a nearby display). \n\nI really appreciated the parts of the museum that dealt with the history of shoes, the different regional and cultural trends in shoes, and particularly the section on the Arctic footwear and accompanying clothing. It became very apparent to me that the women (because it seems to have been mostly women making many of the historical and traditional footwear on display) who made these were combining artistry and engineering and material science and design all into one high-functioning article of apparel.", 5], ["Love this museum! Upon entering you are greeted to a beautiful staircase of dangling shoes which directs the flow of traffic to each of the different exhibits.

I have a soft spot for fashion history, so to learn about the history of something that has become so basic and everyday for us was quite cool. My favorite part of the museum was their special exhibit, Out of the Box: The Rise of Sneaker Culture. All of these sneakers from every era were in glass cases, and you were able to experience how sneakers started as something very practical and became a fashion commodity.\n\nOverall, this was a great museum that I would encourage you to visit!

How about making cool shoe laces or punching holes and making designs with laces and paper? We really enjoyed the museum, don't get me wrong, but it seems there are fabulous possibilities yet to be explored!\n\nWe loved all the shoe-related books and spent a good bit of time reading...that was lovely...a little hard to read in the darkness tho (I totally understand and accept why the exhibit areas need to be darker)--perhaps there could be a better lit area for reading and for the arts and crafts tho?\n\nWe had a SUPER time!

The grilled pork was flavourful and not very greasy to my surprise! The grilled mackerel was slightly salty but paired well with the wraps. The soup that came with the combo was piping hot and satisfying with the wraps. This combo is a must here !! It is a steal at $31.99 for TWO people, including tax and tips it was less than 40 dollars, so definitely an affordable meal.

They offered us the family sized garlic naan, which was the best naan I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The reason I like it is because it is thin and crispy, yet soft and gooey on the inside.

Each croquette is a burst of flavour bomb in your mouth (the combination of shrimps inside, uni, caviar, and potato foam is a winner). The potato pur\u00e9e foam itself is enough to make you want to lick the plate clean.\n2) Toban Mushrooms (mixed mushrooms with yuzu kosho) - Great mix of 4-5 different types of mushrooms (king, shiitake, oyster, enoki mushrooms) in a nice, delectable sauce... comes out on a sizzling hot plate.\n3) Miso Black Cod (with ab sake yuzu foam & shishito peppers) - I'm a big fan of Japanese-style miso black cod. This one was done pretty well. The yuzu foam gives a nice citrus flavour that contrasts the saltiness of the sauce on the cod.\n4) Octopus Roll (octopus cakes wrapped in crispy rice with furikake & sesame seeds, and marinated baby octopus salad with pickled vegetables & wakame seaweed) - This is SO unique and can't be found anywhere else.

The best and most creative roll out of all 3 rolls that we tried that night.\n5) Whitefish Aburi (with ginger and ab sake soy) - Unique, tasty flavour that's different than other aburi I've tried in other Japanese restaurants.\n\nOther items we ordered that are also pretty good:\n\n6) Crispy Rice topped with Cajun Tuna (with nori paste, spicy ponzu aioli) - Quite spicy, even without the spicy ponzu aioli. This was my least favourite.\n7) House Salad (mixed greens, carrot, green beans, cherry tomatoes, with ginger dressing) - Ain't your average Japanese restaurant salad... pretty good mix of fresh vegs and good-sized portion (can easily feed 2 people).\n8) Grilled Asparagus - Nice, simple, charred grilled asparagus (pretty big pieces).\n9) Protein Roll (crab mix & asparagus, wrapped in soybean paper, topped with salmon, tuna, flounder, and yellowtail) - This was somewhat disappointing... too much mayo, and it wasn't as unique / creative as the other dishes.\n10) Show Me the Roll (shrimp tempura sushi roll, topped with salmon belly aburi and chipotle sauce) - Spicy but with big pieces of salmon belly aburi.", 4], ["Loved everything about this place. From the interior design to the great service and phenomenal food. We ordered the spicy tofu, miso soup,baby spinach salad, brother from another mother (sushi roll) and some other items that I unfortunately can't remember but enjoyed thoroughly.\n\nI highly recommend this spot!", 5], ["I'm not sure if this review counts as biased as I have scoured all Yelp reviews in advance to pick the best menu options. But the food we had didn't disappoint and our server was amazingly attentive (thank you for singing happy birthday for me!)\n\nTUNA PIZZA (5/5)\nStarted off with my favourite dish of the night, this is a must-try and came highly praised out of all the reviews. Flavour and texture is spot on and definitely something I haven't tried at other restaurants. \n\nSALMON TATAKI (4/5)\nExcellently executed with nice sharp wasabi notes to match the seared taste of the raw salmon. We opted for this instead of the aburi because we didn't want to get salmon that would be boringly blow-torched. Overall, nice presentation and tasted refreshingly refined but a bit basic! Still would order again.\n\nCRISPY RICE (5/5)\nLOVED THIS - this was a close second but a favourite of my boyfriends. The assembly of the seaweed salad topping, seared tuna, and deep fried rice with the spicy ponzu aioli was just hitting every note for us in our mouths. \n\nGRILLED ALASKAN KING CRAB (4/5)\nReally meaty and so easy to eat, it was a delight to enjoy and you really can't go wrong with this dish if you love crab. It's just a shame that for the highest priced choice of the night for us, it only came in 6 legs. The quality was great and I'm no seafood expert so whether it's good value or not, I wouldn't be a judge of that.\n\nWAGYU FRIED RICE (3/5)\nA plain filler choice for the night but it paired well with the king crab legs! Nothing amazing, a bit oily, just tastes like any teppanyaki style fried rice. The meat was kind of tough and dry for me but it was in such small pieces, it wasn't really noticeable in a bite. Still don't regret ordering this because I'm not sure if I would have been full enough without it and it was a nice break from all the seafood we consumed.\n\nPOP ROCKIN (3.5/5)\nThis takes the title of most interesting for the night. We didn't want to try the other rolls as it looked too saucy but we also were worried we wouldn't be full enough at the end of this tapa meal. So we decided to try this roll which was a pleasant surprise on the first bite! I loved that they used asparagus for a nice subtle crunch with the spicy tuna. If you have fond memories of pop rocks (the sour candy that pops in your mouth) then I would recommend this. My only qualm is that I could do without the pop rocks after my second piece. Would be great for sharing amongst 4ppl but it was a bit much for 2ppl (not portion wise, just the taste of pop rocks can be overwhelming in 8pcs). \n\nYUZU CITRUS (4/5)\nA nice, light refreshing dessert to end off our meal! If you love lemon flavored things, it's kind of like a pudding texture. I'm not sure if I would have picked a strawberry gelato to go with it - would have been nice to have something that cuts the acidity a bit better but still really enjoyed the overall flavours!", 4], ["Delicious food. I went with a bunch of raw items, including tartare and sashimi. Very good and fresh. \n\nBuild your own tartare was fun. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is nice. \n\nService is very friendly and helpful. \n\nI would definitely recommend trying this place.", 5], ["The presentation of the food and restaurant ambiance is what Akira Back does best. In terms of the food, none of the dishes that we ordered stood out. Especially for the price, the food was extremely underwhelming. \n\nWagyu tacos - unfortunate how the wagyu beef was grounded up this way. Without the sauce, the beef itself was very dry and could not taste the qualities of wagyu that differentiates from lower-quality beef. The wonton shell was also extremely oily, with the oil dripping all over the plate (see photo). \n\nBrother from another mother roll - too much sauce. Overpowered the taste of the other ingredients. \n\nUni 3 ways - the fresh uni was good. Not a fan of the other methods of preparing the uni as the taste did not fit together.\n\nTuna and mushroom pizza - this dish was good, preferred the tuna over the mushroom.", 2], ["Akira Back has the feel of an underwater cave - it is dark and intimate, accented by a gold bar at the very end. A large sculpture of an eel can be seen gliding across the ceiling. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is that of intimacy - both with your company and with the food. \n\nThe food as a whole was delicious - but not mind-blowingly so. My favourites would have to be the Brother From Another Mother rolls, Truffle Bomb Croquettes and of course, the matcha cake. \n\nThe wagyu fried rice was good but that was it. It was just good, but not great. I guess cutting up the wagyu into tiny pieces just doesn't do much to the fried rice. It just tastes like a regular beef fried rice to me. The wagyu steak tacos were very good - my only issue was that they were too small. I would've preferred if they were bigger than my palm (I was surprised since the photos made them look bigger!). \n\nBrother From Another Mother was beautifully decorated. You can taste the ingredients separately (like the unagi, ponzu a\u00efoli and foie gras). Truffle Bomb Croquettes were a roller coaster - you go from tasting the saltiness of the caviar, to the creamy and briny texture of the sea urchin and then to sweetness of the shrimp. I would highly recommend ordering the croquettes as they are definitely a highlight item on the menu and it is probably one of the most exciting item to order! The matcha mousse cake was delectably sweet and was decorated accordingly for my friend's birthday. \n\nWe had the Princess Mononoke as our drinks - super strong and packs a punch, just like the actual Princess Mononoke! \n\nStaff were great - they were non-pretentious and were very friendly and accommodating. Food came in at reasonable intervals. No complaints there. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend coming here for small group dinners or for a romantic date - great ambiance, great service, great food.", 4], ["Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! I've already raved about it to so many friends.\n\nIt's located adjacent to the Bisha Hote. It has a modern, swanky, and sexy atmosphere with amazing food. All things I love.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you'll notice that the entire stairwell is gold, it's so luxurious and gramable. Immediately upon entering I could tell this is a scene type spot in Toronto. The entire crowd looked so good, making this place the perfect date night restaurant.\n\nService is excellent, the waiters are all very attentive. I don't think my water glass was ever empty at any point. He also had great food recommendations.\n\nDrinks are on-point. I had the Akira Back Saketini. A ginger infused sake with hints of lime and lychee for a refreshing after taste that is sure to get you buzzed.\n\nTheir desserts are simple, but the sorbet served as a great palate cleanser and was uniquely placed on top of a bed of shredded coconut, which were extremely creamy.", 5], ["We came here to celebrate my spouse's birthday. The atmosphere of the restaurant is sophisticated, with dim lighting and artistic decorations. \n\nWe ordered the below items and I will give my ratings to each one:\n\nWagyu Beef Tacos (3.5/5): The first bite was really good, the taco shell's crispy and the beef is very flavourful. When it comes to the second one, I would say it's a bit too saucy and salty. \n\nSalmond Aburi (4/5): Honestly we thought it would come in a sushi form, since we generally think Aburi means Torched sushi but guess that's a misconception. Anyhow, the dish only comes with the torched salmon but we both loved it. The sauce and the salmon balanced out nicely. \n\nSeared U10 scallops (4/5): We are scallop lovers and this dish is no surprise to us. The only thing I have to say is that maybe give more than just two scallops for $23... yuck, pricey!\n\nHot Mess Roll (4/5): You can really taste the sashimi even with the amount of sauce they put on it. I really like it but can't say the same for my spouse. \n\nBrother from another mother roll (3/5): We had high expectations for this roll after reading all the good reviews from everyone. However, it's a bit too saucy and probably because of that, the rice just kept falling apart when you pick up the sushi. \n\nOverall, I am giving Akira Back a 4 star. The service was good and our dining experience was great as well.", 4], ["Wow this place was extravagant and the food was delicious! I came here on a Monday around 7pm with my friend and her mom for her birthday. When you first enter the building you come to a gold staircase that leads up to a dimly lit black restaurant. The decor was tasteful, modern, and intimate so it seems like a nice place to celebrate special occasions. \n\nThe service was great! Our coats were checked when we arrived and we were seated immediately. Oddly, it seemed like they were overstaffed for a Monday night. Every time a waiter would come to attend to our table, a second waiter would accompany them just standing there while one actually took our order. There were several waiters just walking around finding something to do, and it seemed like the manager couldn't find anything for them to do either.\n\nI had the Princess Mononoke and it was STRONG, but its the perfect way to portray the princess in a drink. \nAs for the dishes, the Crispy Rice was very delicious and the tuna was so tender! The Rock Shrimp was good but felt like the sauce was a bit overpowering. The tuna tacos were also tasty and the tuna was so soft it could basically melt in your mouth!\n\nOverall, I think this place is great for a group since the dishes are sharable, or date night since the ambiance is very intimate", 4], ["Amazing!! The tuna/mushroom pizza was to die for and all the other seafood was super fresh! I would love to come back but it is definitely for a special occasion.

It's a piece of crispy sushi rice topped off with a thick piece of salmon with seaweed salad on top. Love the combination of the flavours - it reminded me of the crispy rice balls at Nobu (which I'm also a fan of)\n\n2. Salmon Pizza - 5/5\nThis was delicious!!! Thinly sliced salmon on top of a crispy thin cracker-like base. Probably one of my favourite dishes of the night.\n\n3. Waygu Beef Taco - 3.5/5\nThis was also pretty good but it didn't taste like anything super special. To be honest, the beef tasted like a cheeseburger. \n\n4. Hot Mess (sushi) - 4.5/5\n\n5. Brother From Another Mother (sushi) - 4.5/5\n\n6. Show Me (sushi) - 4.5/5\n\nAll of the sushi rolls were really really good. I want to eventually try all of them on the menu.

Simple but flavorful. \n\nWagyu tacos were great. The tacos are compact and crispy and didn't fall off of one side as it tends to happen with me and tacos. Grr. \n\nMiso black cod was good too; I'm all for creativity but wasn't sure about the yuzu foam that came as its side.\n\nJust a little unsatisfying overall and nothing special.", 3], ["The only surprised for the evening was a special lobster 4-ways menu for two ($100). Our waitress noted they're testing the dishes to see if there's interest, so what's detailed in the post is subject to change or may be discontinued all together.\n\nI think most of us coughed on our first sip of the lobster miso soup as we weren't expecting it to be spicy. The initial surprise aside, the rich hot broth was delicious, the lobster legs infusing the salty and spicy soup. Plump little mushrooms were strewn throughout and a nice addition with the seafood essence.\n\nHaving had lobster sashimi a couple of times, Akira Back was the best experience - the lobster tail lightly torched to take away any gumminess, but the meat left raw and sweet. A bit of the freshly grated wasabi and house made soy sauce was all it took to flavour the dish.\n\nThe lobster tempura was okay, but since the batter was dense (where are the wispy crunchy bits of tempura?) it ended up tasting like fish sticks instead of chunks of lobster claw. Akira Back needs to work on the batter's consistency and frying temperature of the oil as the sea urchin tempura ($18) was no better. The creamy urchin wrapped with citrusy shiso leaves was a good idea, if it weren't for the heavy coating that completely covered the seafood.\n\nWhat arrived with the fourth course seemed too small for two people - a small sliver of poached lobster with nori butter sauce. In general, this menu for two would be insufficient, tables will need to add on a couple of items to round out the meal. Perhaps a bowl of the wagyu fried rice ($14) for some grains? While it is a tad oily - not surprising with wagyu - the rice had such a great wok hay essence. It'd be even better with more scallion.", 4], ["Food was great. One of their vegetarian rolls had mushroom and some pickled vegetable on top. It was a very refreshing roll if you are feeling for a lighter meal. I liked their taco appetizer as well, although it tasted more Korean than Japanese. Dessert was really great too.\n\nService was truly amazing. I mentioned we were celebrating for a birthday in the online reservation. We were feeling quite full and was trying to decide whether to skip dessert, our server was encouraging us to get dessert so we went for it. Later we found out that the dessert was complimentary when we saw the bill.

Some of my favourites included the wagyu tacos, tuna pizza, truffle bomb croquette, miso black cod, and seared scallop.

Definitely will be recommending Akira Back!", 5], ["The decor is very dark and decadent; you feel surrounded by glossy black, marble, and gold. Service was quite good, as was the food overall. The reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it is unfortunately just way too expensive for the amount of food you get.  The wine list has some reasonable bottles ($60 ish), but one of the cocktails was $30!! \n\nWhile I won't go back, I think it's a restaurant worth trying if you want to celebrate a special occasion, and if you're not particularly hungry.  Here is my summary of various menu items:\n- Wagyu short rib - REALLY delicious flavour, tender and juicy. But it only comes with 3 tiny morsels of meat\n- Tacos - delicious, but so small \n- Truffle bomb - so good. Recommend these for sure!\n- Wagyu fried rice was far superior to kimchi fried rice\n- Chocolate in a cup was by far the best dessert. Get one all for yourself and do not share. Matcha cake was forgettable. The black sesame cheesecake literally comes as 4 tiny cubes meant for a microscopic human to eat. The yuzu dessert is tasty but too small.  I AM A GROWING BOY. \n\nI do not recommend the following items:\n- Filet mignon - one of the servings was nicely medium rare but the other one was overcooked\n- Tuna tataki, salmon tataki, and hirame carpaccio - meh\n- Tuna pizza - this was supposed to be a standout dish but I thought it was meh; the crust is very thin and lacks flavour\n- Brother/Mother roll - this sushi roll has fois gras and it seems totally unnecessary.

My other friend is vegan and really enjoyed their vegan sushi option with the coleslaw. The great thing about these dishes is that they don't try to overpower the taste of the fresh fish.

Now those friends like it so much that some posted photos of their meal on their Insta (which is normally reserved for architecture) and others claim it's what they'd likely choose for their last meal on earth. We like it so much that we try to figure out how to replicate it at home, then give up; realizing this guy is a patient and diligent food genius, carefully shaving countless veggies, chiffonading piles of fresh herbs, and concocting brilliant sauces that we couldn't possibly match.

There is a vegan options with just the salad or add a duck egg.She told me that the other stuff on the menu (except for salads) was unavailable. It could be because I came here around 6:20pm and they close around 7pm.\n\nAs I ordered, several customers came as well as a Uber eats delivery guy. \n\nI got my order promptly, they serve your food in takeout boxes so you can decide whether you want to eat in or takeout. \nThere's about 6 seats near the window if you choose to eat in, and you can pay afterwards. \n\nMy order was about 13$ after taxes which is kind of steep for salad. But I'd  say the portions are well worth the value. I was pretty much 110% full and bloated after eating this. \n\nAs for the flavors, the duck egg was pretty dark and runny. The runny yolk combined with the salad is divine. \nThe dressing for the duck egg is a mixture of sour and spicy. \nI looked at the menu again and it did say pad Thai flavor, I'm not too sure if it taste like the pad Thai that I usually eat \nOverall, the mixture of herbs such as cilantro and the crunchiness of the beansprouts made the salad pretty refreshing. I really liked the yam noodles that they placed at the bottom as well.\nThe mixture of colors from the carrots, the greens as well as beets and watermelon radish made this dish very aesthetic. \n\nI'd definitely come here again and order  other items from the menu! \n\nOnly thing I'd have to complain about is the duck egg was burnt and the  sourness and spice of the dressing. was a little over powering and made me thirsty, if it was toned down a little it would've been perfect!", 4], ["Wow - best vegan bowl ever! Their Muay Thai bowl has so much flavour and a wonderful crunch.

Oh and it was $10 (with a fried duck egg on top).\n\nThe juice I ordered was also wonderful and incredibly cheap. For a fresh pressed ginger zinger it was $7 and I had almost too much of it.\n\nOn top of everything the staff was incredibly sweet. This kind of establishment (or at least comparable places I know) tends to favour the apathetic-white-girl-with-dreads kinda staff while these guys are absolutely the opposite.

Packed with over 12 veggies, cold noodles, and tossed in a light but flavourful dressing, its both satisfying and delicious. There is so much going on that every bite is a little different and you never get bored.

You do have the option of adding a duck egg to the MTB and salad and a bit more grains to the salad.  The great thing... you get a a ridiculously wonderful and flavourful HUGE salad for only $8 ($10 with egg).    Most people here order the MTB as the lovely people behind the counter was saying 90% of the people order the MTB... and I can tell you that there is a VERY good reason for it.\n\nThe MTB is a huge overflowing box of the most flavourful vibrant and crunchy salad you probably had in Toronto.  If you have had better... you gotta tell me cause it will be hard to believe!  There's over 12 ingredients in this and each one offer a new twist on the flavours you're tasting and crunching through. The peanuts, thai dressing, and chili just makes this so unique and bursting with flavour.  On top of that, it looked to have a few Thai basil and other fresh herbs (cilantro?).  At the bottom of the bowl/box are gluten free yam noodles.  I normally eat huge salads but this took a long time to even make a dent.  After munching for nearly 20 minutes straight, I kinda saw a small corner of the bottom... and I noticed all the great sauces just coated the noodles.  Normally they're quite tasteless but these guys just soaked up all the great flavours.\n\nEven if you're not vegan, this would be a hearty, healthy, and satisfying lunch.  I'd have to jump on the bandwagon of 5 stars and give it a perfect 5 as well!", 5], ["I don't have much to add to the many rave reviews and detailed descriptions of the Muy Thai Bowl (MTB) but damn that's a good salad.

Starting with delicate little sprigs off the top and then you hit those first taste of dressing and after that you find the duck egg (if you ordered one) and another kind of dressing and when it is starting to get kind of messy and churned up you discover a trove of noodles and another whole different array of tastes. It's a real experience eating it.

Veghed has the scent of a vegetable garden. Pots and pots of pea shoot fills the restaurant with fresh vibrancy. Food is alive at Veghed. \n\nThe Muay Thai salad box ($9) is out of the world. Veghed's 22 ingredients salad one of the best I have ever had. The owner called it the reversed daily vitamin. The salad is designed as an complete meal with yam noodle, mint, basil, pea shoot, chili, peanuts, spinach, tofu, bean sprout, cucumber, spiral beets, spiral zucchini, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, napa cabbage, cabbage, cilantro and ginger-tamarind and green leaf dressing. Just reminiscing the salad makes me salivate! \n\nThe beet brownie ($3 for two) is equally delicious. It is a less evil counterpart to a traditional brownie with vegetable in disguise.

The chicken sandwich was crispy and tasty, the lamb stew was good, but didn't really taste of lamb. The sheppard's pie lacked flavour and needed way more seasoning, and the chicken tenders were really dry and bland. To make things worse, three of us ordered the ginger ale, and it did NOT taste like ginger ale. It tasted like a fake Pepsi + 7-Up mix and was way too sweet. We asked our server about this, and he assured us that it was ginger ale, but all three of us agreed that this was a ginger ale wannabe, and we were all disappointed.\n\nI've visited this place 3 times over the past two years, and 2/3 times I haven't been satisfied with my meal here (I've had the burger which was pretty tasty, and another time I've had fish which tasted off and I had to send it back). \n\nThe trivia was a lot of fun, and because of this, we will likely be back... just not ordering food. \n\nVisit this place on a trivia night for fun times and great service, but unless you're looking for mediocre food, I'd give this place a pass.", 2], ["Went during the Cabbagetown festival as the owner gave us some free coupons on the street for small glasses of beer.

I split their veggie burger and lamb burger (it may have said something like Greek-style) with a friend. The veggie burger actually comfortably won out, with a tasty well-seasoned black bean patty and fried jalape\u00f1o bites in it. i enjoyed the lamb burger, but was still a bit mildly disappointed with it - namely because the lamb was a bit too overcooked.

This is one of the few places where the beer menu looks like a food menu and vice versa.  The food menu is a smaller black covered thin pamphlet compared to the beer menu which is a full blown, full sized, categorized, organized and graphically engineered piece of art.\n\nOK maybe that description is a bit overkill but seriously... the beer menu is serious.

Stout is a great place to get together and laugh while you let your competitive spirit come through as well.\n\nThings got pretty loud but it's all in good fun.

When we walked in, I thought I would love the place.\n\nWe sat down and I quickly realized this visit was probably going to be mediocre.  First, for an Irish pub they have only two Irish beers which I find very odd.  Also, the food prices were fairly expensive for the area.\n\nI had the shepherd's pie as desired and my friend had the butter chicken.  My pie arrived in a neat stacked fashion but I found it fairly bland and dry.  My friends butter chicken was relatively small in portion size.\n\nService wasn't exceptional and neither was the food.

You can't go wrong with this comfort food dish. They prepare this dish with 3 different types of cheeses (Asiago, cheddar, smoked cheddar) and a creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce. The smokiness of the cheddar really comes through in this dish. However, the star of the dish is the ketchup! It paired so well with the mac and cheese.

Now I'm glad I didn't, because I can add more in this time after my second go-around.\n\nStout is named as a tribute to Murphy's Irish, the only Irish stout you'll find on draft here. I like that the place wants to celebrate \"the other\" Irish beer that often takes a backseat to the popular front-runner, but holds its own with a creamy, nutty flavor and full body without a bitter aftertaste. You won't want to mix Murphy's with cider unless you want something that tastes very, very sweet. Just drink it straight.\n\nThe craft beer selection here is commendable. There is always a Great Lakes beer on cask and the microbrew selections are a nice combination of American and Canadian. They turn over their kegs rather frequently too - a good thing when it comes to the quality of the taste.\n\nThe food? Very, very good. Better than you'd expect for a pub. Fries and Stout burger crisp and juicy, respectively. The bun could've used a little extra work. However, the fish and chips was OUTSTANDING. The beer batter was perfect and the fish meat itself - slimy, almost gelatinous, pretty much perfect in my eyes. Some people may be put off by just how soft and slippery the fish was (did not have a white fish meat texture), but I adored it. It was a large portion and I found myself wanting to finish all the fish because each bite had the ideal texture of crispy to mushy without being oily. \n\nStout it a winter bar. There's a fireplace in the front room, many board games for use, a dark cozy feel, and the attitude that it's best to be safe and cozy with a pint and some grub, rather than outside braving the cold.

They have a ton of craft brews available, and the staff seem to really know their stuff.\n\nThe only complaint I may have is their food. It's not bad, it's just sort of generic pub food. I got wings and fries. The fries were HUGE and just a bit soggier/thick cut for my liking. The wings were also gigantic, but really really salty, and despite what the menu says, they only go up to \"hot\". I did taste some Moroccan spices on the wings, which I found pretty intriguing, but the saltiness made it really difficult for me to finish them.\n\nIt's sort of out of the way for me, but if I ever need a drink in the area, I'm definitely hitting this place again!\n\nOh and there's free wifi, you just need to ask for the password.", 4], ["Great spot.

Remembering their great selection of beers, and hoping we wouldn't be waiting in a line to get in, we popped over.  Such a good decision.\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately at a small table in the cozy front room.  Our server, Anne, stole the show for the evening.  First off, she was genuine and clearly enjoyed what she was doing.  Her knowledge of the beer menu helped to guide our first beer choice, and her recommendations were spot-on.  Only a few minutes into our beers, we realized that the front door was creating a bit of a cold draft and with perfect timing, the couple seated in front of the fire in comfy chairs just happened to be leaving.  We approached the hostess who happily cleared the table and invited us to move.\n\nWhat was probably going to be a quick beer and a snack became a relaxed, cozy, yummy evening in front of the fire.  The nachos we ordered were nothing special, but were a perfect compliment to our beers.  We polished them off and then my partner wandered over to the bookshelf full of board games.  After pulling one game out and then almost putting it back, Anne appeared and reassured him that it was a great game (The Duke) and perfect for two people.\n\nIt was.  In fact, we're going to buy it.  Best of all, Anne gave us a quick overview of the rules and a few pieces of advice and off we went.  Along came a second round of great beers and then we decided to try the bourbon barbecue wings. Fantastic wings!  What an enjoyable evening of great beer, tasty pub food and a fun board game.  Best of all was our server, Anne.  Thanks Anne, for making our evening special!

I chose to get sushi rice to start off as a basic. it came to $13 with tax and they made it very quickly.\n\nin the wasabi salmon bowl it included the sliced mushroom, Seaweed salad, Carrots, flavoured cucumbers, rice and of course salmon! at the side there is a seasoning topping side and I chose to add some sesame seeds and crispy onions. I found that the poke bowl was a perfect ratio of salmon, additional toppings and rice. the wasabi sauce was flavourful and light and I loved it with the other toppings. the salmon was also soft and buttery showing that it was high quality. \n\nI would come here again if I want a good meal and I'm willing to spend a little extra!", 4], ["Came here for a spicy Salmon poke bowl.

While I've been here a number of times, it took me a while to warm up to this place because their prices initially put me off. After several visits, I felt more and more that it was worth it. Their Poke tastes so fresh and their portions of protein are great. They have everything added in their reportoire for what makes a great tasting Hawaiian poke, especially adding furikake to their rice which no other places do.\n\nWhat actually ended up sealing the deal for me was their recently introduced Hawaiian hot plates. Hawaiian comfort food is so rare outside Hawaii; there's literally no places that serve these dishes in Toronto until Pokito picked them up. Pokito does it really well too; the sweet and savoriness of their Kalua pork was on point, and the slightly crispy texture of the pulled and roasted pork was to die for.\n\nTheir fresh, flavourful food aside, there's one other thing that sticks out about Pokito, and it's definitely their garnish bar. After ordering your food, you can put as many toppings and as much as you want of any of the garnishes onto your poke. They have anything from togarashi powder (highly recommend), to coconut flakes, fried onions, pickled ginger and even jalapeno peppers; all these can add a ton of crunch and flavour to your lunch.\n\nAll of Pokito's varied options are delicious, and I can wholeheartedly recommend Pokito as one of my favourite places for eats on Queen Street!", 5], ["Can't go wrong with $1 pok\u00e9 (ritual special)!

I've never had wood ear mushroom in pok\u00e9 before and honestly wasn't a huge fan.

I believe a year or so ago, they offered bowls at the same price but you get to choose 4-5 toppings, and some of the more expensive toppings would count as 2. \n\nI went back there yesterday to discover that that was no longer the case and you can only choose 2 toppings! So I was stuck between the choice of choosing a pre-fixed bowl (with no option to substitute) and choosing the spicy creamy salmon which is my usual order, and only choosing 2 toppings. I chose the former and I did NOT enjoy the toppings that it came with. I understand that the cost of food has probably gone up, but I was too spoiled with the prior menu choice to settle for less now.

Both come with a leafy green salad which does a decent job of convincing you you're not eating 1000 calories.\n\nCoffee is served in neat old mugs that came from the 80s and 90s.  They have weird books on the shelves on how to cook with microwaves.  The whole restaurant smells like a cast iron frying pan.  The only downside was the coffee was meh... but what did I expect?", 4], ["The real meat is in the marketing...\n\nWhat I mean is, the presentation of the food and the experience of being at a trendy new spot taste better then what is on your plate. The food is good, but doesn't add up to the 'buck.'\n\nThat said, it is still a fun spot and I had a good experience overall.\nIt's worth trying once. I recommend for a group of 4:\n- double date\n- family \n- group of friends\n\n*if you go at prime dinner time, expect at 45min-1hr wait\n** they do take reservations, but book a few days in advance", 3], ["Went here for dinner today with friends.\nWe ordered the platter.\nWhen the platter arrived everything was cold.\nThe desert had no flavour.\nWe were rushed with the bill as there were people to be seated.\nI will not be returning.", 2], ["I went to Barque yesterday with high expectations. We ordered the brisket, ribs, mac n cheese and the winter slaw. The brisket was good it was juicy but Ive had better brisket. The ribs were dry and tough. We really should have sent them back. The winter slaw was probably the best item we had and the mac n cheese was good but not great. Its in my neighbourhood but I wont be back.", 2], ["Having been to over 20 places for wings and other bbq houses I must say hands down this place was the best. Our server was concise, courteous and made sure everything was a pleasant experience. We got the BBQ sampler and while it was pricey, definitely worth it.", 5], ["ALWAYS enjoy our meals here. Family style dinner is my favourite. Best brisket I've had in the city by far. House-made bbq sauces are bold and tasty and always perfectly compliment the meats. Usually quite busy so there can be a wait to get a table and noise level is high in winter. Summer patio small and lovely.", 5], ["Had ribs, pulled pork, chicken thigh, brussels sprouts and fries. Everything was very good. Price was decent as well. Not the best BBQ I've ever had but great for a neighbourhood place.", 4], ["We visited for dinner. My Roncy pal raves about the brunch. First off, I really have to commend their staff for their professionalism and doing the utmost to give us the best experience possible. Knowing how busy they typically get for dinner, especially on a Friday night, I called ahead and made a reservation. Despite being late, they not only held my reservation but also saved me a seat on the patio, removed from all the racket of inside. My friend who has a few years of food service management under her belt was very impressed with the way their staff handled everything under pressure. So full marks for service. Bonus points for the bucket of seasoned popcorn ready at the table. \n\nI had a Half a rack of Sweet Heat Baby Back Ribs with sides of  Squash & Brussel Sprouts and Creamy Smoked Cauliflower. The sides came in little cast iron skillets. The ribs were so perfectly succulent with such a well-balanced flavour profile and a great wood smoke undertone. My only disappointment was not ordering the Full Rack. Every table has a brush used for rubbing on two of their signature sauces. I didn't think the ribs needed anything extra. \n\nMy friend had the Pan-Seared Pacific Halibut with a smoked paprika emulsion and candied sweet potato. The plate had a beautiful presentation. She said it was a tad under seasoned but generally well done. She also ordered a Homemade Pecan Pie with Cinnamon Gelato, which couldn't possibly be bad. \n\nI would say, going by the food alone, Barque is the best smokehouse in Toronto.", 5], ["Went to Barque for brunch on a Sunday. Food Network was filming 'You gotta Eat here' so I knew right then and there that we were in for a treat. The place filled up half an hour after it opened so luckily we got there upon opening because we had a party of 8. If you plan on eating here for dinner I suggest making a reservation (if they allow) because this place will sit around 40 people max. \n\nFor the menu, well that's the best part and it's just brunch. Some items popped up and said 'EAT ME' and they were the: Barque Benedict (cornbread, poached eggs, beef brisket with hollandaise sauce), Pancakes (smoked duck, yeah that's right, duck!, blueberry compote), and Caramelized Apple French Toast (with brie cheese and cinnamon crumble). While I was deciding on what to get, one of the waiters writes on a small chalkboard 'special of the day - rack of baby back ribs with salad and fries'. this decision just got tougher. I decided that this place will need another visit, at least. I eventually went with the Benedict because I was feeling for eggs and I wasn't disappointed. It was just made to perfection even the cornbread was great. the beef brisket was tender and delicious. Oh, and it comes with a salad on the side.\n\nOther item I tried: Smoked Candied Bacon - it sounds super delicious AND it is. it just depends where you bite onto it. you can taste the strong seasoning at the ends of the bacon which wasn't so great but overall, still super delish. Also, a friend of mine ordered a caesar and it had candied bacon on the rim and sides of the glass. I went on ahead and started picking them off the glass when he was done with the drink. \n\nOverall, the food was amazing and i'll definately be back for dinner (menu is drool-worthy). The setting and ambiance is what you would expect from a local, 'you must eat here' type of restaurant. I just wished they opened a place like Barque in North York where it is much closer to me.", 5], ["I've been to Barque quite a few times now, and love it every single time. We normally stand the long wait times for the well worth waiting for food. We normally get an order of the Sampler for one (with some extra meat) or two (depending on how hungry we are) and some sides. The beef brisket is the absolute bomb. Definitely order this, same as the baby back ribs. Normally get the Cuban corn and some grilled veggies/ on the side. If the wait wasn't as long this would get 5 stars.\n\nPS: try their signature drinks!", 4], ["I went there for brunch today for the very first time.  We had a reservation and were seated in about 5 minutes after arriving.  The place was pretty full but it didn't feel crowded.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and loved every bite. I loved the atmosphere and I will definitely return there to eat.  I am looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu!", 5], ["This spot is good but not great. I guess it's not fair to compare this place to BBQ in the states, but really what's so hard? Good beer though and a great location.", 3], ["This place has an awesome brunch menu!  I need to go back to try all the options - I hadn't been so excited ordering in a long time.\n\nI settled on the smoked brisket Benedict on corn bread.  It sounded great but execution was a little off.  Brisket needed to be more tender and the potatoes were on the greasy side.  The french toast though is really out of this world\n\nI'll be back to give this place a 2nd try: pulled pork scrambled eggs, chorizo skillet and pork bely breakfast tacos are on the list!", 3], ["Sadly, Barque comes nowhere near what it purports to be.\n\nHaving just returned from a trip to Texas I decided to give it a go, as I was jones-ing for some smoked goodness.\n\nI had the sampler for two, which I split with my wife, with sides of veggies, and fries.\n\nThe ribs were stupidly chewy. No 'fall off the bone' here. I've had more enjoyment from a $4. bag of beef jerky. They weren't even smoked all the way through. Same with the sausages. Not smoked through enough. If I want the joy of a real Italian sausage in all its glory, I'll got to an Italian joint, or cook 'em at home.\n\nThe chicken was good. Smoked through, and still quite juicy.\n\nThe fries were outrageously overloaded with salt. I mean, how can you botch fries? How hard can it be? Toss 'em in the fryer, and sprinkle a pinch of salt on 'em. It ain't rocket science..... I love salty foods, but even those fries were too much.\n\nNow for the vegetables. They were crisp, and fresh, as they should be, but some genius that plans out the menu decided that they would be better if they were 'seasoned' with sesame oil. \n\nWRONG. You're not an Asian restaurant, you're a smoke house. Don't get cute.... Tasting sesame oil in conjunction with smoked meat doesn't work.\n\nOne of the few things that was positive, was the service. The server was prompt, and engaging, even though she was quite busy.", 1], ["Came here with friends on Saturday aft, they were serving brunch.  Busy place, 40 min wait for tables, so we sat at bar. Menu was brunch-modified BBQ items but a special was also available, baby half rack of ribs with side.  We all had this, I also had cheddar biscuit and pint of St Ambroise pale.  Food was good, came with BBQ and honey mustard sauce on side for dipping.  Service was a little slow, and I had to remind the server about my biscuit , but overall ok.  I would def come here again. Obviously a popular place in Roncesvalles village.", 4], ["Most of us, went with the sampler for one which allows you to choose 3 meats, and 2 sides.  My sister and her partner were apparently feeling agreeable and opted instead for the sampler for two (3 meats, 3 sides).  We started the evening with a few appetizers to share, so throughout the evening here is what was sampled:\n\nSmoked Dry Rub Wings\nReally meaty, juicy, substantial wings, with a delicious dry rub that had a perfect amount of heat.\n\nSmoked Miami Beef Ribs\nGorgeous.  The ribs were not fatty, but rather, perfectly rendered and satisfyingly chewy.  I loved the sweet and sticky glaze.\n\nBrisket Burnt Ends with Ginger Onion Fried Rice\nProbably the best dish of the whole night.  The burnt ends were meltingly tender, and coated in a deeply aromatic, sweet glaze.  What was really interesting was the large  rice \"cake\" that had been fried to crispy perfection and positioned to catch any meaty juices from above.  I loved all of the contrasting textures going on-  tender, rich meat, supple popping rice grains, crispy fried edges, and a delicious chew from the caramelized exterior. Addictive doesn't even begin to describe this dish.\n\nMerguez Sausage, Sweet Baby Back Ribs, Brisket\nWow, that sausage had the most incredible spicy flavour, and a satisfying \"snap\" in the casing.  It was just bursting with juiciness, without tasting greasy or fatty. While I really loved the heat level, most of my family found it a bit too much for them.\nThe ribs were beautiful as well.  Tender, smokey, and just the right amount of resistance on the bone.  With a nice balance of sweet and acid, the sweet sauce was just perfect.\nThe brisket was another clear winner.  It was perfectly seasoned, and while delicious on its own, was really special with a smear of the mustard based sauce.", 5], ["We ate here on Father's Day. They are always busy, so make sure u make reservation. We started with tuna wonton, which was a very fresh and yummy, though the portion is small, only 2 wontons. Ordered BBQ sampler for two, brisket was the best, juicy and tender. Everything else was just average u can get the same somewhere else. Service was a little slow. Took the waitress a long time to pack our leftover food and hand us our bill, not sure why.", 3], ["Appetizers are creative and delicious. Meat was great too - but not my favourite.

Kinda broke my heart when they were amidst management change a few years back in 2015 if I recall correctly, but now that they've reopened, only arteries will break at the first clog because that poutine will not go unfinished in one inhalation. \n\nWho new that meat from a Cow's brisket can taste this good? The fixings of an ultimate gangster in-between rye, slobbered in mustard and that juicy crunchy pickle to finish off that monstrous meaty brined and spicy bite. My favourite Jewish kosher number whenever I need a 'pick me up' with my coffee or even a cold coke.\n\nThe meat slicer is so entertaining to watch while waiting for my order, as I watch other loyal fans either order pounds of meat and stacks of bread right at the counter for the next couple of lunch entrees or for breakfast on the weekend. I've never dined in as it happens to be packed every time I come which is normally close to dinner.

Perhaps I'm spoiled after trying Katz (in NYC) earlier this year, but it doesn't even come close to being that good.", 2], ["Excellent flavour to the smoked meat sandwich.  Fries were cooked the way I like them, crispy. \nThe maltzo ball soup was pleasantly tasty.  Seasoned right and served hot.  \nThe only downside to going here is the limited parking.  It's in a small strip mall.  \nI would go here again.", 5], ["I was never a deli fan. In fact, I was more of a vegetarian until I found Pancer's. After having enjoyed several pastrami sandwiches, I accidentally fell upon their knish one evening. \n\nI must say, it brought back memories of the best Yiddish dishes anywhere this side of the border. Don't believe me. Go to Pancer's and order a knish. And oh yes, don't even think of ordering it without a side of gravy!\n\nI promise you I'm otherwise a sorta healthy eater! Splurge already! You won't be sorry.", 5], ["Wish we had known about this place sooner. Cosy, friendly place. I ordered the matzo ball soup (one of the best I've had) and a lox/cream cheese sandwich, where the bun was crispy and the sandwich was delicious.

It was incredibly hard to choose what to eat.  I ended up getting the breakfast sandwich with bacon, and a biscuit to start.  The sandwich was amazing.   The biscuit was even better.  I love buttermilk biscuits and get one pretty much any time it's on the menu.  This was probably the best ones I've had in Toronto.  The home fries were easily the best home fries I've had as well!

I cannot wait to come back!", 5], ["Dirty Food is a great breakfast spot in the west end. The space is small (not really suitable for greater than 4 people). They do support Yelp waitlist so I recommend checking in before hand to put your name down. \n\nMy party of 4 went for brunch on the weekend at 10am and the wait was around 30 mins. We tried:\n\nShrooms Eggs Benny - served on Rye toast. Hollandaise sauce was simple and not overdone. The eggs were perfectly poached. The toast itself was quite small which made the overall presentation look kind. \n\nChicken and Waffles - tasty and what you'd expect. The chicken had a faint spicy kick. \n\nPastrami Eggs Benny - overall good, the salt in the meat paired well with the eggs. Both side options - home fries and salad were great pairings with the Benny. \n\nCinnamon bun - a great post meal dessert that tasted fresh and wasn't overdone with glaze. \n\nMy only qualm was that the fries (both spicy and regular) were extremely salty. I'm sure this was particular to that batch that morning. As such, I recommend staying away from the fries and just going for the home fries instead!", 4], ["Came here for brunch with my friends and it's a cute little brunch place.

Dirty food eatery is a cool little spot that serves some amazing brunch. \n\nFirst, I've gotta give a huge kudos to yelp that introduced this online wait list feature that dirty food implemented. No longer need to wait in line, just check in through the app and the restaurant will give you live feed on how many tables are ahead of you and will text you when your table is ready. \n\nThe environment and vibe of the restaurant is really good with really friendly staff. Bar seating is pretty sweet, you get to be in the middle of the action. \n\nThe food is pretty good as well, got Johnny cakes, peameal bacon, salmon Benny, and biscuit and chicken with white gravy. We ordered way too much food and could have done without the side order of peameal and Johnny cakes however both were good still. \n\nThe salmon Benny was really good. Hollandaise sauce was on point! Really rich without being too over the top. That sauce really made the dish. \n\nFor anyone who loves fried chicken, you must try the fried chicken and biscuit with white gravy. The white gravy was so amazing. The chicken was crispy golden brown on the outside and really juicy and tender on the inside. \n\nIf you're in the junction area and looking for a spot to brunch. Check this out! It definitely helps that the seating process is painless as well.", 4], ["This place is fantastic. Went on a Sunday with some friends and got the dirty burger and the biscuits and gravy.\n\nAs a burger aficionado, the biggest thing I look for in a burger is the explosive flavour that hits you right when you take the first bite. Few places are able to get that immense taste just right, but this is one of them. The beef and cheese are simply delicious, and not overloaded with random toppings. The home fries are a neat concept too, being cubes of shaved potatoes, really increasing the surface area for crispiness. \n\nThe biscuit and gravy, which also comes with fried chicken and greens, is equally up to the task. Together, these two mains were just so good and will easily have me coming back for more.", 5], ["Came here for Sunday brunch along with what felt like half of Toronto!

The waffles were meh but dipping them in the sauce helps! \n\nThe eggs Jenny: biscuit was moist, hollandaise sauce was wonderful and the eggs were cooked perfectly.

What sets this apart from the classic are a few things. The salmon is beet-cured, the flavour and texture complements the poached eggs. I do not know how to explain it unfortunately. Instead of English muffin, the base is their signature pancake (Jonny cakes). The fried capers adds a fun crunchy and slight salty element to the overall eggs benny.\n\nApple Jonny Cakes - This sweet breakfast item is better shared amoung two or even three people. Tasted like a pancake version of a hearty apple crumble with oat clusters. \n\nService & atmosphere: As soon as we walked in the staff did not come to greet us right away, they were busy so it is understandable. The view to the kitchen is open, so you can see all the action if you are seated close.

I got it with home fries, and these were so good - a must try for sure! You can even opt for half salad, half fries if you want! My friends got the chicken and waffle, and they said the chicken was really good, but the waffle was nothing special. \n\nThis brunch spot is a bit on the pricier side, but the portions were pretty big.

We ordered 2 classic, 1 fall pancake, and a chicken and waffles. Everything came out very promptly and was hot and delicious!

No wait for a table. The waitress was quick and attentive. She brought the coffee and took our orders promptly.\n\nThe bad: we both had the classic eggs Benedict that came out in less than 5 minutes after ordering. Wow? That's not always a good sign. \n\nI don't expect perfection when ordering at a greasy spoon diner style restaurant but Hollandaise must have some acid otherwise it's just butter and egg yolks. This hollandaise sauce had no acidity - no lemon and no salt even. The Ham was tough, the potatoes were ok - pretty standard.\n\nThe ugly: upon walking in their (I'm assuming) floor manager was at the entrance talking on the phone loudly about cross contamination. At first we thought she was a customer but then watched her walk around sort of anxiously overseeing everything. You could tell she was stressing - I'm not sure what about but she made the vibe uncomfortable. \n\nThis place is a pass for me. I wouldn't recommend it.

Decent coffee  and reasonably priced. \n\nIt was pretty empty when we went and the following day we tried a place up the road which was packed and had people queuing to get in.

Baked in a wood-fired oven, a Montreal bagel is boiled in honey-sweetened water and has egg in it ... obviously, a perfect choice for a dish like Eggs in a Hole.  \n\nI highly recommend it: Excellent melted cheddar topping bacon that tops the bagel that tops the fried eggs. YUM! \n\nAnd what a revelation, Breakfast Poutine! I had several bites of my wife's BP, which was essentially a mountain of hollandaise, home fries, squeaky cheese curds, off-the-bone baked ham & bacon, and two poached eggs.

We also shared the dragon fries- yum!! A nutty miso glaze and spicy banana peppers made this dish finer licking good!

I placed my takeout order before arriving at the restaurant and it was ready when I arrived 20 minutes later. I told them about my food allergies and they made sure my item was gluten free, dairy free and cucumber free. I asked if I could sit somewhere even though I ordered take-out and they said I could sit at the bar but I might have to leave if someone comes in because people who order takeout can't eat in the restaurant (I thought that was a little weird but I ate my salad in peace). \n\nI ordered a small \"Big Salad\" and really enjoyed the flavours. I found it really filling and would definitely order it again. \n\nWould I return?\nAbsolutely!\n\nPS: the patio looked amazing! I'd definitely request a spot on the patio if I arrived normally and dine in.", 4], ["I personally really liked this location, I went with my boyfriend last night and we sat on the patio which was so pretty with lights and hanging pots. The service was amazing they were really on top of everything.

So, the menu is quite limited from a GF perspective. No gluten free bread and the fries are cooked in the same oil as wheat based foods. So, all we get is salad and rice fun!! Nope, if I'm eating at a restaurant I want to actually feel full.\n\nThe rice was kind of bland and the lemon sauce was pretty basic. I used chopsticks and the rice didn't stick together. I don't remember much about my bowl aside from 3 pieces of very basic tofu, chickpeas and an overkill amount of very bland rice and a bit of greens and it was $20!

Definitely don't bother getting a \"small\" bowl and get the large as the price difference is negligible. Also they should warn people how small their new small bowls are. \n\nAlso don't get the small protein bowl in general. 1 piece of tofu, 12 black beans, a handful of veggies and some brown rice -  shouldn't be $20 with tax and tip.

Green Poutine was good but too large portion for an appetizer. The sweet potato fries were great. The taco was great in taste but very messy to eat. The filling was out of proportion with taco size which made it quite difficult to eat. The burger also had the same issue as Taco - messy to eat as the avocado slices slide very easily - not a good idea to put it in a burger. Not at least like that. Having said that, I loved the bun!! \nWe also went for the Green Detox and Big Green smoothies. Green Detox was really amazing. The flavor of ginger was great and the overall spice was quite punchy. But the heaviness of the ginger and banana was very well balanced with the lightness of the greens. The Big Green was great as well. Very light and refreshing.", 4], ["I only had the smoothie here so far but it was yummy, I want to come back and try the burger and poutine because both looked good.\n\nI feel like this kind of place is great for when you want to eat yummy food and have good drinks that are good for you and taste good!", 5], ["Do not sit on the heated patio in winter unless you are dressed for wind and cold.

The bar was busy so we didn't get our drinks until then the food came and the service was medium - we had to flag servers down a few times for things. The food was mostly good. The Poutine was excellent as was the superfoods salad - I loved the 3-6-9 dressing. The banana split milkshake was amazing. The cornbread was okay but would have been better warm and the cashew cheese tasted more like a hummus spread and was a bit bland but really nice with salt and cayenne added (which you can ask for). The hot sauce was also great. \n\nI'd go again but research the food items other people recommend and definitely sit inside!!!", 2], ["I've read the recent reviews and I was a bit worried to see comments about slow service, bad service, or lack of flavour.  I thankfully didnt see any of those issues creep here.  I saw all of those when I went to the Bloor St location but I would say of the 3 Freshs I've been to (Bloor, Spadinda, and Crawford), this one was the better experience.\n\nArriving on a Sunday brunch, we were able to book online a reservation and so we had no issues getting a table quickly.  I think it's not well known that they're on OpenTable for reservation.  It's super easy to book a spot that way.\n\nWith only 30 minutes after opening, the patio was nearly taken.  I think we took one of the last 2 tables.  The inside though... was bare!  Maybe only 3 tables were taken.  With the patio, it nearly doubles their capacity.  So if you see a line up out the door or crowding the front, take a peak... it might be people waiting for the patio in the summer.  You can score a table with zero wait inside. As for the seating, it's not so crowded on the patio.  Definitely busy and definitely full but there's enough space that you dont have to move tables to get out (like in Bloor).  As for the space itself, it's clean and open with a lot of shade.  You can be at the edge where it meets the sidewalk and you will have lots of sun.  That morning, they were still using the heater and I sat underneath it.  I was kept cozy as it was late spring.  \n\nService here was 3 times faster than the other 2 spots (Bloor and Spadina).  Though there was about 3 staff managing the patio, they kept the food coming in and out as they were trying to bring more and more of the line into the patio.  I dont think we waited terribly long for anything.  We might have waited a bit to order but it was no where as bad as the other 2 spots.  Maybe a little more than 10 minutes.  After our order, the app came in quickly with our salads and bowls shortly after.  I think your experience will heavily depend on how good your servers are... cause we got some terrible ones at Bloor but here, they're faster and more aware.\n\nBuffalo Cauliflower - This has to be my favourite app on the menu... I keep ordering it and there hasnt been a bad plate yet.  Tender cauliflower is battered then fried up crisp and dressed with a tangy hot sauce.  They always arrive hot and crispy.  Some people love the onion rings or the sweet potato fries... I always go for the cauliflower!  4/5\n\nUltimate Falafel Salad - I tried this this a while ago and though I love all the vegetables they put into this, the falafels themselves were just ok.  They werent really crispy or hot... just kinda warm and a bit mushy.  They generously piled on the crispy onions, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, mint parsley, and cranberries on the salad base.  A nice drizzle of the tahini sauce just made things perk up in flavour.  Maybe I'll try a new salad next time but this still is one of the better ones I've tried.  3.5/5\n\nTangled Thai - This was a nice colour salad with the spirals of carrots and beets.  They had also the purple cabbage, cucumbers, red peppers and tons of peanuts on top.  We did ask for few extra add ons and they gave a super generous amount.  Unlike some places where they only give you 1 tbsp... they pile it on.  So never feel like the extras are a waste of money.   The peanut citrus sauce was a good way to add more nutty flavour to the salad.  4/5\n\nI think Fresh can be hit and miss but this particular Sunday, they were much better than usual.  I think if you arrive before the crazy rushes you'll have a better experience.  Sunday brunch seems like a good time to hit the patio if you want.", 4], ["Fresh on Crawford has a nice patio for the warm summer days. The inside dining room is cozy; i.e., the tables are all very close to each other. Parking on the street is usually not a problem to find.\n\nI've been coming to this location for years. It has been sad to see the steady slow decline in food quantity and quality. It still serves tasty vegan food, but not as good as it used to be. And I remember when tacos/wraps/burgers came with sides included, or when the grilled cornbread servings were half load and full loaf, as opposed to the current 2 thin slices or half loaf, at quite high prices.\n\nHere are some of the dishes I order from the current menu:\n\nSquash Tacos (two tacos served in grilled whole wheat tortillas, with crunchy panko coated squash, shredded greens, creamy jalapeno/lime taco sauce, onion & cilantro) make a nice light meal; the crunchy panko coated squash adds a nice texture to the dish. The last time I ordered this, the recipe had changed - I believe it was the taco sauce - and I did not like as much as it used to be prepared.\n\nFalafel Tacos (two tacos served in grilled whole wheat tortillas, with green falafel, red cabbage, turmeric mint tahini, spicy zhug, sweet amba, crispy onions & tomato) also makes a nice light tasty meal; I've had better vegan falafels in town, but these ones are still ok.\n\nBlack Bean Burrito (spicy black beans with avocado, fresh 'cheese' sauce, cilantro, alfafa sprouts, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, red onion & mexican hot sauce) is a more substantial meal. If you like beans, you will like this dish. The texture and flavors are nice, the avocado adds richness to the burrito, while the lettuce, cucumber and red onion add some crisp freshness.\n\nBlueberry Almond Pancakes, served with maple syrup, is tasty and filling, as they tend to more heavy than fluffy.\n\nService can be slow at times, depending on the server and where you are seated.", 3], ["I'm sad that you guys keep changing the menu.

As a gluten-free vegetarian, you would think this is a god send - right? I make a lot of food like this - but for some reason things that are supposed to be gluten free here still don't sit right with me. \n\nWhile they have a disclaimer on cross contamination - I am not super strict, and go to many mainstream places with substitutions. So for some reason there is something that is really bothering me here....\n\nI'm pretty sure it has to do with their fryer - they use the same fryer for everything. The fries bother me and the crispy tofu. I think the quinoa onion rings are what contaminates everything. First of all, when they first came out with quinoa onion rings, I was ecstatic! I thought they would be gluten-free (hello quinoa is GF) - but they have spelt in them :( I can't complain as obviously they are not just accommodating gluten-free folks - they are serving vegetarians - and gluten taste good!  BUT had those quinoa onion rings been gluten free - they would not have gluten contamination in the fries and fried tofu! Or if they didn't have just one fryer. I know this sounds a little crazy - but I've had too many onion ring particles in my fries and bowls (that have tofu in them). \n\nSO I recommend if  you are gluten free (not a preference but celiac or intolerant) to specify you want nothing from the fryer. The falafel balls also have gluten (though are traditionally made without wheat). \n\nA couple of other beefs - skimpy on the tofu (the baby bowls get one piece of tofu!! - um tofu is not that expensive). Juices are a little overpriced (not even organic or cold pressed). While the server hipster demeanor has calmed down - still there. Overall overpriced. They don't have a wide selection of gluten-free desserts. \n\nBUT \n\nDefinitely fortunate these are around and accommodate us veggies and gluten-free folks. They even have a separate gluten-free menu to make it easier. Your non-veggie friends will even enjoy. \n\nSome recent favorites: \n\nTiger Bowl (actually a sauce that saturates the whole bowl. I hate dry/hard rice in other bowls in takeout) and the Kale Salad (sub the tempeh bacon). The green juice with Himalayan salt (I think they put TOO MUCH salt in the one I had, but it gave a refreshing kick). The soups (though a tad overpriced).

They have a great selection for both vegans and vegetarians, and offer items with and without meat replacements which I think is wonderful. \n\nThey also have this great tofu that's different from anything I've had elsewhere. Has no strange tofu flavour, instead it's mild and almost has a hint of smoke. I also prefer this location over the queen/spadina one as I find it's much less busy and has a bit more space thanks to the outside patio.

It used to be good, really really good. Back in the days when there was one restaurant on Bloor and there was an Urban Cowboy sandwich which still makes me drool at the memory. Those were the days.

Their baked goods are good, although highly overpriced compared to other places that serve the exact same product (go see Sadie's Diner at Adelaide and Portland for the same baked yummies for less). But I have found that in the past few years the food is either bland or waaaay to oily (ahem, Dragon Bowl that actually made my hunny sick it was so oily). The waiters are apathetic and sometimes rude, seating is RAMMED (you will be sharing dinner with your neighbors, and if you have a lot of parcels and stuff with you I wish you luck) and the service is also quite slow (even if it's not rammed). \n\nIf you are going to eat here, if you are determined to do so, I have a fall back dish that doesn't seem to be too bad no matter the location that you go to. And that would be the Holiday wrap ladies and gentlemen. It's not too oily, it's hard to screw up, and I also may recommend that you add Tempeh for some extra protein.  The only thing that I LOVE on their menu are their sweet potato fries served with miso gravey. And if you remember Fresh in the old days and want to recapture days gone by, snap up the first cook book. It has all the recipes that were well-loved back in the day.\n\nBut honestly, if you want some really good vegan and vegetarian eats or are taking out your carnivorous friends to experience all that meat-free dishes have to offer, there are soooo many better places to go than here.", 2], ["Fresh is a great chain of vegan restaurants that will surprisingly fill-up even the biggest carnivore.

The salads are also chock-full of veggie goodness and covered in mouth-watering homemade dressings.\n\nIf you want a really filling meal, try their tasty veggie burgers or noodle bowls! The desserts (most are gluten free) are also worth a try.

I was starved and getting cranky and when I saw how crowded this place was I was a bit upset that I might have to wait.

Canadian cuisine at its best actually- thank you for the wonderful food experience.\nBest to skip the wine pairing- you could bring your own wine to match the season- a nice Sauvignon Blanc for summer, Pinot noir for winter etc. The wine pairing definitely could have been more refined, as other yelpers have mentioned.

The repeated comments about portion size by other reviewers I didn't understand- it's like they never did a tasting menu before.", 5], ["3.5 \n\nSo this restaurant is small and off the beaten path and the staff is incredibly warm and genuine.

I mean I like them, don't get me wrong, but the dishes seemed rather weak. My favorites were the fish dish, the bread, and the dessert. Everything else seemed like it tried too hard to prove it was a good steward of the environment. \n\nAgain, I gave it four stars, even though I wasn't a huge fan, because I recognize the amount of work that goes into curating a menu like this and the fact that I'm not a fan doesn't mean the shitake mushrooms or sunchokes weren't cooked perfectly.

It's quiet, sleek, and very community focused. The restaurant is actually the first floor of chefs own house, and the mood they are trying to set for you is like you are invited to dine at chefs house. The chef will prepare the food for you and bring the dishes out to every table and introduce his thoughts, ideas, concepts behind the dishes. The ingredients are all locally farmed or foraged.  I have to say not many restaurants in Toronto are able to do the same, not even Antler, not even Alo. \n\nFlavour wise - super super yum and refreshing.

The dishes are well thought of and executed, balanced,nutritious, and creative. We were absolutely swept off the feet! One of the highlights we had is the charred spinach with some green dipping sauce. We were not served any utensils as the chef explained this dish was encouraged to be consumed with hand. We tried and I've never had any other spinach that's better than this! It's so delicious. \n\nWe didn't have the wine pairings they offered but the a few drinks we ordered were all amazing. \n\nWill definitely come back!", 5], ["I have first heard about Actinolite from a foodie friend of mine. We were sharing stories about memorable gastronomical experience, and Actinolite Restaurant came up in our conversation! I had no idea the restaurant was located in my home city, Toronto, and it was certainly a very memorable meal.\n\nMy date and I were seated at the window seat, and it was the perfect spot for photos to catch all that natural sunlight. We each ordered the 7-course Chef's Menu (includes snacks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts), and shared a delicious wine pairing from local Ontario vineyards.\n\nIt is true about what other Yelpers have mentioned: It is not for everyone. I know some people might not see its true value or are turned off by the raw and cooked plant-based ingredients. But what made this meal memorable for me:\n\n1. The hyper-fresh, foraged ingredients. The colours are so vibrant, it looked almost surreal! I never thought the greens and flowers I see can be edible! #goingvegan lol. The chefs at Actinolite are 'obsessed with freshness and quality that came with picking produce and presenting it on the plate moments later'. Fresh ingredients used were harvested from the restaurant's very own garden, and foraged from the fields around the actual town of Actinolite, Ontario!\n\n2. The creativity and unpredictability of each dish. You don't know what ingredient is going to pair with what, which makes this meal very exciting! The plating is often clean and simple, but I know there is a lot of work and details put into it :) A couple of my favourites were the Halibut with watercrest, mint and kelp, also, the Enoki mushrooms with hemp seed and onion cress! Ooo and the cured salmon... that was fantastic!\n\nI would highly recommend this for adventurous, open-minded foodies. Every dish speaks character. It is definitely worth a try :)\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe All-Ontario, Road Trip-Worthy, farm-to-table Restaurant Series (6 of 17)", 4], ["Part of a longer review...\n\n\"Halibut cheek with spring cabbage and white spruce broth had winter comfort written all over it. Yet, its simplicity in presentation made me wonder if it would be satisfying. It was all that and more. The meaty halibut cheek complemented the subdued spruce notes from the broth.\n\nThe next dish was a testament to the strong relationships Cournoyer has cultivated with his suppliers -- a cornerstone of Actinolite's philosophy. As he presented a single potato, he joked that this was \"Greg's potato\" because it was grown by Greg Hill, a farmer from Cobourg. Une seule bouch\u00e9e confirmed that this pomme de terrewas la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. The skin's waxy texture combined with the just-cooked flesh were elevated by a reduced whey sauce and wilted spinach. This dish made me appreciate the austerity of local ingredients as they are -- and the heartiness of a single, perfectly-cooked potato.\"", 4], ["I spent a fantastic evening pampered by their flawless staff, and chef Justin and his magic creations. My friend and I enjoyed the full tasting menu with wine pairing, and was blown away with the complicated simplicity of the dishes. Ingredients we're allowed to shine on their own, yet bask in hints and allegations from perfectly picked spices, sauces, and techniques. W the wines we perfectly paired, but could easily have stood on their own. As it were each wine complemented each dish and elevated it. It's hard to pick any one fish as a highlight, but also pointless as the menu shifts with the seasons. We do loved it that we finished the tasting menu and jumped right back in with the small tasting menu, but at this time chef Justin was excited and we got treatef to some new dishes he was working on, which we then discussed. Four hours of heaven where a simple slice of potato, a piece of bread, a parsnip or an asparagus finally get to be the stars of the show. \n\nTry the full menu with wine pairings and surrender to perfection. Where is the Michelin button?", 5], ["Actinolite is small, comfortable, and unassuming. I felt at ease dining there with my partner. The atmosphere struck the right balance to make our meal feel like the special event that it was without getting lost in pomp.\n\nOur meal was fantastic! Each dish emphasized the beauty of the local agriculture. We visited in May and almost every dish encorperated fresh flowers. They weren't just a lovely garnish; the buds were an essential component to the plate, often adding a lightness and slight bittering agent. A couple stand out plates were the raw radish starter with charred lily greens and the snow crab in hay butter. One could feel the chef's passion to share Canadian cuisine with his guests. Utilizing local, seasonal, fresh ingredients really put his point across to diners - local isn't just better for the environment, it is a better way to eat.", 5], ["Don't know how anyone would have anything bad to say about this place. Small and cozy atmosphere. The food was amazing. Service was amazing. Definitely go for the 7 course with wine pairing- it's worth it. Was a little loud in the dining room but there was a large group in there so I'm sure that isn't always the case. Worth every penny.", 5], ["As many reviewers have mentioned, Actinolite is not for everybody, but I decided to take my parents here - so it had to be, at the very least, for my folks. And me, of course. \n\nWe had a total of 11 courses, 2 of which were remarkable. A spinach salad which, with the first bite, exploded with umami, and a grilled perch which incited much joy from Chef Justin Cournoyer (we were the first guests of the evening, and as we finished the dish, Chef Cournoyer excitedly came over to us to ask how the dish was, and told us a story about his own childhood)\n\nActinolite locally sources many of their ingredients, including the seafood - which is important, because Toronto seafood can disappoint. Seafood is certainly not one of our comparative advantages, for a litany of reasons. \n\nNo, Actinolite is not cheap - and neither is the food traditional. Even so, the food pulls from a variety of influences, a diversity which makes this city so great. \n\nA real experience, and one of the great Toronto restaurants.", 5], ["The restaurant is tucked into a residential neighborhood. It's the first floor of the chef's house so it was like we were eating in his living room. We went for the chef's menu and the experience from beginning to end felt very intimate. The chef came out to greet us as our meal started and he explained the philosophy behind Actinolite. The restaurant is named after Actinolite, a community in central Ontario where the chef is from. There was a lot of thought into the menu in terms of the season and where the food was sourced. The menu changes but my highlights were the seafood dishes and dessert. We also asked for a tour of his backyard garden. The chef led us back to the back of the house where he grew some of the herbs that went into our meals.", 5], ["We had an unreal meal there last night. To be honest I am not up on my forged food but the owner/Chef Justin couldn't have done a better job preparing the food and making us feel at home.  The cuisine was very earthly and simple but cooked to perfection and the combinations worked.  The ambiance is quite cool as well and very cozy.  Justin lives upstairs with his family so the feeling is you are eating in his house.   The prices were very reasonable given the quality.  If I lived locally this would be one of my go to spots as the food, ambiance and service were all spectacular.", 5], ["Actinolite soars above the base mediocrity that is Toronto, and finally offers people from here a legitimate reason to be proud of their city.  \n\nHaving lived in Toronto for the past year, I've found the city to be, at it's most basic level, well...basic.  The fourth largest city in North America is one of the continent's least picturesque and lists Drake as it's largest, and perhaps only, contribution to world contemporary culture.  The outsider cringes in a mix of pity and revulsion at residents' curious tendency to laud themselves for being \"Torontonian\" for no other reason than \"Home is Toronto.\" \n\nWhile these fact remain, Actinolite offers a blueprint for making Toronto a city that residents' can legitimately be proud of, that people from the rest of the world want to visit, and that those who do visit actually want to return to.  Set on Ossington Avenue, \"the Champs-Elysees of dreary streets\", the owners have transformed a former storefront into a beautiful, contemporary restaurant that tells a cohesive and compelling story of Southern Ontario.  When one enters the restaurant, the sleek interior gives way to an elegant dining room enclosed by warm colored walls and minimalist tables adorned with beautiful, local ceramics.  The concept that \"Home is Toronto\" curiously induces appetite when one is seated at Actinolite.  \n\nThe dining room is stage for a culinary experience that should be featured in a Netflix special.  Chef Justin paints agriculture and foraging in Southern Ontario through the brush of cuisine in a way that I have not experienced anywhere else on earth.  I have now eaten at this restaurant twice, and enjoyed two \"seasons\" of locally sourced food in the late spring and fall.  I've enjoyed everything from fresh razor clams to delicious enoki mushrooms in a light broth; \"forest floor tea\"; the freshest squid from Vancouver; various cuts of tender and delicious Enright beef; and finally, some of the most enlightening desserts I've ever enjoyed, which made novel uses of unfamiliar ingredients like the kernels of apricot pits and spent mash from a local brewery to create lightly sweet, savory, and indelibly memorable dishes.  The wine pairing is similarly excellent, represented by local champions like Pearl Morissette.\n\nWere the Michelin Guide to ever venture off piste into Canada, Actinolite could possibly garner a star and even two.  Based on a thorough culinary survey of the city, it is certainly the only restaurant in Toronto worth eating at twice.", 5], ["Ok\nHere's the thing ,everything is well prepared in the essence of the restaurant. We had the chefs tasting for 105.00 which we felt was fine considering the effort put into preparing food etc....\nIt was just incredibly small portions. The halibut and duck portions were 3 bites of meat. Everything else not outstanding in any way. The dessert cake was stale. \nService, first waiter was underwhelmed and felt annoyed to be there. Multiple thank yous to her;not one your welcome or enjoy. \nSecond waiter was much better although i believe he could tell we didnt fully enjoy our meal and frankly we both were expecting more. It was not cheap, bill over 400 (bottle wine,tip),therefore disappointing. I would suggest to them ;maybe try adding a course ,a pasta dish and tightening up service which was night then day if i compare the waiters. \n\nI cooked when i got home\nNot a redo. If you have tiny appetites check it out for yourselves however their are much better tasting menus in the city.", 2], ["Really don't understand what the all the rave reviews are about. I've been driving by this place everyday and read great reviews so naturally I had to try it. Booked my reservation and already had it in mind to go with the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing. \n\nNow, let me just say, I have a great appreciation for chefs that are passionate about local ingredients and convey and share that passion with their customers. From the ownership to the kitchen to the wait staff. That passion is shared. And for that, I will give a 2 star rating. \n\nBut seriously. About $100 per person with drinks and the serving size is a joke. Spin it however you want, apple 3 ways, cooked and raw locally sourced..you gave me cubed apples. About a spoonful. And that was the theme for the entire menu. Cabbage and Halibut? It was a shred of protein. Squid? Less then an ounce. And this beautiful wine to go \nwith it? Barely 2 sips. If your going to charge $65 for wine pairing at least pour a generous glass once during the course. After 7 courses, we hopped in an Uber and went right to Harry's charbroiled for some substance. \n\nWaste of money. Great staff, waste of money on something I can't even consider a snack. Would I ever go back? Nope. Would I recommend? Not a chance. Do yourself a favour and book a reso at a place like Skippa.

Great job!!!", 5], ["Actinolite is not for everyone. It is both unusual and rather expensive. You can opt for a $60 or $90 tasting menu on a stretch of Ossington that is definitely not restaurant row.\n\nWithout breaking down every bite, here is what to expect...\n\n1. Local or hyper-local ingredients in season. \n2. Those ingredients may be moss, leaves, or something you or I never saw on the Swiss Chalet menu. And.... it works.\n3. Surprise! The food is delicious. It manages to be healthy and tasty. If you are looking for granny's Thanksgiving meal pig out, you won't find it. However, you will leave full. More than that, you will have a meal that is uniquely different from every other place in town. Actinolite is distinctive.\n4. I agree with reviewer Jay in that I wish the wine list were more elaborate. I also wish they had a couple of beers on draft. \n\nAll things considered, this is simply a warm, unique experience.

We have never ever had a less than perfect meal, everything is super fresh and tastes amazing! As always, I can't wait to go back!", 5], ["We hit up Oyster Boy for some small additional bites after having some drinks and food at Mother next door. We had to wait a little bit on Saturday night for a spot to open up at the bar, but it didn't take longer than 15 minutes, allowing us to wander the neighborhood a little before getting a call to come back. The restaurant has a homey, casual feel to it, with a lot of seafaring decor adorning the walls. Although we were at the bar, service was a little bit absent - once our order was in, we were basically paid no attention, and we had to interject in order to get some more oysters. The drink selection isn't that great - mostly macro brews available, with only a couple of crafts handy - but it works in the end.\n\nFood-wise, I found that everything here tended to be pretty average at best. We did oysters, because why not - Canada has some of the best oysters around, and on balance quite a bit better than the U.S. - but most of the oysters seemed a bit underchilled, and many of the oysters had little chunks of the shell in them, likely a result of being shucked with little regard aside from getting orders out quickly. There's a nice variety, though, and the flavor was still pretty good. The seafood chowder had a solid flavor to it (if a bit undersalted), but there was too much stuff happening in it, particularly in terms of other things (e.g. potatoes) to soak up the broth. As such, about halfway through, I felt like the soup was gone and we were eating soggy potatoes that had absorbed the broth. We added some veggies to round out the meal (brussel sprouts, to be precise), and that was okay too.\n\nIn all, while we didn't eat a broad swath of what was available, I felt like everything we had was solid if unspectacular. I probably wouldn't wait to sit down if I was being picky / had more than one night in town. That being said, I did enjoy the casual vibe and the rock tunes blaring in the background, and it's not a bad spot to chow down on some seafood if you're really hankering for it.", 3], ["We ordered:\n\nSeafood Chowder ($13.00)\nThe chowder was tasty with seafood in every bite!\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese ($30.00)\nThis was super delicious!

They came with hot sauce, ?????, and ????. My family seemed to like these very much. The 2 lb lobster was huge, and very meaty, with lemon and butter to dip. The meat was soft and easy to eat, and the lemon & butter made them 100% tastier. The side of brussel sprouts was actually my favorite part (which is surprising because I usually hate them with a passion). They were honey roasted, with a crisp outside, but soft center.", 5], ["I'm half & half about this place. Let me start off by saying that this place is NOT family friendly! It's small, no stroller space, no change tables (individual washrooms), pricey etc. However great place for a guys or girls night out- always call or make resos before hand here. Anyways..\n\nI'm iffy about this place for several reasons. For one- the manager /owner I'm assuming has an odd attitude. Now that I've looked at past reviews of this place I'm not the only one who noticed. He's passionate about this place which is awesome, but he's kind of intimidating & obnoxious. He was drinking behind bar taking shots with a group of men (assuming his friends) at the bar- which is cool , but their swearing & talks about drugs threw me off and made me feel uncomfortable considering it was just 6pm lol. He doesn't have the most welcoming personality but the rest of the staff is nice. He certainly caters to a certain demographic & u have to have the same type of humour as him to get along with him..\n\nIt's extremely over priced- a dozen malpaques cost 35$ when I go to any other seafood place and get them for 20-22$. I also saw no difference in quality or freshness. I can justify prices for many of their items (lobster is insanely worth it here!), but ironically not their oysters. Beers are also expensive too which suck because you can't have oysters without beer.  Their seafood chowder was good- really salty and wouldn't order again so I wouldn't recommend. \n\nI will not be returning here unless I have to.", 3], ["If you're looking for fresh seafood, oyster boy is definitely the place to do it!\n\nOther than being know for the major (if not the only) supplier for oysters for restaurants in Toronto, they also serve fresh fish and other seafoods at their small yet charming restaurant.\n\nHands down my favourite is their mixed grilled seafood platter, which comes in a huge scallop shell metal plate and filled to the brim with scallops, king crab, shrimp, mussels, grilled fishing calamari and tasty fries.

This small resto that has been standing strong for years on Queen west is a hit amount locals...you certainly will not find any tourists romping in this joint. The food is not only exceptional but the service is very attentive. We started the meal with 18 local Canadian oysters from PEI and Nova Scotia. The oysters are flown in daily and are shucked at the front-of-restaurant oyster bar. All oysters are accompanied with freshly grated horseradish, a homemade hot sauce, classic seafood sauce and minionette. We then Shared the salad special with candied pecans, strawberries and pickled onions atop mixed greens and the house coleslaw. The salad was perfectly balanced with sweet and savoury flavours and the slaw was so delicious we ended up getting a second order. For main dishes we order the bouillabaisse and the Arctic char. The bouillabaisse has a delicious wine and tomato broth and the Arctic char stop the stew was crispy and cooked to perfection. The seafood stew was adorned with perfectly cooked clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp. The Arctic char was atop a tahini sauce, lentils, taboule and homemade falafel. The combination of flavours and textures in this dish were very Mediterranean but a perfect compliment of flavours. If you're in Toronto and want to experience a local favourite make sure to check out this hidden gem and local favourite...you will not be disappointed.", 5], ["3.5 stars... the oysters were so good.  Come for those oysters!  Just choose the other dishes than what we picked and perhaps you'll have a great dinner.\n\nFor oysters, you only have a few spots that specialize it and I've heard how Oyster Boy is able to get a lot of fresh varieties around the world.  This spot next to Trinity Bellwoods is not very big ... maybe 12 tables at most with a few bar seating.  Definitely call for seating and don't expect to get a table for more than 4 people on the weekends.  It's a rustic space... kinda like a shack by the bay somewhere.  Lots of wood accents and tons of interesting nautical knick knacks.  It's clean but sparse.  \n\nAfter being seated quickly, I have to say service here is attentive and polite.  We were constantly being checked on till we got our order straight.  I have to say their menu is pretty extensive with a lot of variety.  They also have a daily specials menu PLUS their oyster menu.  I have to admit that I was impressed to see 2 European oysters in addition to the West Coast and East Coast varieties.  They had at least 12 different oyster types for you to try.   \n\nWith both oysters, we were given 3 sauces to add to the oysters.  You have a red wine vinaigrette that has a strong sour taste to it.  A cocktail sauce that is sweet and mild.  Then you had a spicy one that had a good medium kick to it... the only problem with this one was that it could overwhelm the flavour of the oyster because it's so strong.\n\nCascumpec Bay oysters - I liked these ones.  They're meaty for their medium sized shells.  It's a clean flavour that was balanced... not too mineral or metallic or salty.  It's a great one to start off.  These were shucked beautifully.  No broken shells and the meat just sitting pretty.  4/5\n\nBeach Angel oysters - These are a bit smaller than the Cascumpec but I found these to be a bolder flavour.  More briney with a touch of a light vegetable creamy finish. I kinda like these more more than the Cascumpec.  I'm a bit partial to West coast and these helped confirm that.  Like the Cascumpec, these were shucked very well... the oysters were just gorgeous in the shells.  No broken parts or shells.  4.5/5\n\nSeafood chowder - A large bowl arrived to the table and it was very hot.   Though it had the traditional creamy texture and chunks of potatoes, I was kinda disappointed I didnt see any seafood in it.  Perhaps it was blended into it but there was no mussels, clams, fish, or shrimp... all I found was carrot and potato pieces.  It wasn't bad but certainly not a chowder worth $13.  2/5\n\nTuna tostada - A special we grabbed and it was a nice light dish.  Impressive looking as we got a fair bit of tuna on the crispy corn tortilla on the bottom.  It had a lot of creamy avocado with a bit of chillis thrown in.  I would have loved to have more of a flavour other than the occasional chilli.  Some lemon or something... it was quite mild in flavour with avocado being the prominent mild taste.  Still a generous portion ... maybe not the easiest to share though!  3.5/5\n\nBuffalo fried calamari - These were not the sauced up versions I was expecting.  Fried crispy but the buffalo sauce was incorporated into the breading so it was just crispy and not as flavourful as I would have expected.  A touch more salt would have been helpful.  Also, the breading fell apart quite a bit and was a bit heavy ... in the sense that it absorbed a lot of oily.  Though served hot, it wasn't a bad starter.  Just one that I wouldn't grab again.  3.5/5\n\nI think we ordered wrong here... we didnt have enough to go after the large seafood mix grill and I think the large dish of mussels would have been better.  We saw a few tables down order this and it looked really good.  I think it's safe to say stick with the oysters and mussels... things with a shell really and you'll be better off.", 3], ["This place was highly recommended by a buddy of mine, and we decided to check it out on our last trip to Toronto. First of all, make a reservation if you can, because the restaurant is quite small and it gets filled quick. As the name of the restaurant suggests, oyster is the main attraction.

After deciding she could eat it, she ordered it, and I got the crab cakes. Our food took a really long time to get to our table, and people that ordered and came in after us got their food first. When we finally got it, there were things in the salad (cucumbers and tomatoes) that hadn't been mentioned so my friend had to get hers remade. The crab cakes were okay, I ate all of it but started to feel sick by the end. They're heavy, but they were pretty good. \n\nWe also ordered the buffalo fried calamari which was awesome. \n\nLater, it started to get really busy and it took me an hour to get three oysters. Then, I asked for the sauces and the waitress forgot about them so I had to ask again about 5-10 minutes later. \n\nThe food was good but I don't recommend going if you're in a rush.

Great place for casual dining.", 4], ["As you'd expect from a place named Oyster Boy, they have a really great offering. Their price list breaks it down by region (PEI, New Brunswick, BC, Nova Scotia, Pacific US) but make sure you take a look at their blackboard for their specials. \n\nWhat went in my belly:\n\nKumamoto Oysters ($3.50 each/$21 for 6/$40 for a dozen) - These oysters are similar to Kusshi in size and texture and have a really clean flavour to them.\n\nBlack Point Oysters ($2.75 each/$16 for 6/$30 for a dozen) from Nova Scotia - They don't have the same tenderness as the smaller Kumamoto's but were still quite tasty. \n\nSustainable Seafood Chowder - shell and fin-fish, New England style ($10) - It had just the right amount of creaminess and overall it was a decent chowder but probably not something I'd order again. Over the weekend, I tried their ridiculously good corn chowder at Soupstock. Perhaps they should add that to their restaurant menu..\n\nSteamed Clams - garlic, white wine and parsley ($13 small/$17 large). The clams were well cooked - not too chewy, and while the broth was a touch saltier than I would've liked, it was a classic clam dish done well.\n\nOyster Boy Fries ($4.50) - I was surprised by how large the portion was. It came in a large bowl which was overflowing with addictive thin-cut fries. The fries here come with a choice of chipotle, lime jalapeno aioli or curry sauce. I went with the chipotle and had no regrets.\n\nSo... Oyster Boy or Rodney's? I think Oyster Boy is my winner.", 4], ["Great oysters here! We tried the 3 varieties of baked oysters and a bunch of the raw ones.  I really loved the baked cheese and creamy sauces on the baked oysters but my fiance was not as much a fan of the baked ones.\nWe also ordered the spinach dip w/ bay scallops - it was really good and a generous portion size as well. I couldn't get enough of the crostini it came with for dipping.\nThe halibut entree was bleh, we were regretful of that decision and next time will probably only come back to munch on oysters and have a few drinks!\nThe service was a bit slow - we actually waited for half an hour for our bill only to end up taking it to the cash register at the bar to pay anyway.", 4], ["Went for a late lunch yesterday, we were happy to get a seat.\nThe caesars were on point, and hit the spot.\nBig fan of their oysters, and we had the raw ones as well as some of the hot ones which were great- next time i look forward to the deep fried ones.\nWe also had the seafood platter, it was pretty good but we felt it was missing something, perhaps a sauce?\nOverall I had a good experience and I am looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu.", 3], ["If you are looking for an oyster joint in Toronto than this place is for you.\nWhen I went, I was hardly an expert on oysters, so I relied on the knowledge of my server. I mentioned how we knew Malbec oysters were supposed to be good, but he suggested a different east coast oyster from New Bruinswick that they had just gotten in. He stated that in his opinion it tasted better AND it was cheaper. Sold! I really appreciate places that do not try to oversell the clientele. Our server totally hooked us up as they were quite good, and all of the three sauce accompaniments were great. We also got a plate of fries, and I would put them up at some of the best fries in the city. They are very thin and crispy, and come with your choice of mayo (curry, chipotle, etc). We also got some coleslaw which was loaded with dill and was a good pairing with the seafood fair that they offer.", 4], ["Went here this weekend and they had a pretty good selection of oysters.

Servers were super friendly and let us know when a table was free, although we were pretty comfy at the bar, so we just decided to stay put. We ordered a couple rounds of wine, raw oysters, and baked oysters that night. \n\nI don't completely recall all of the raw oysters we had that night, but our server was super helpful and let us know which ones tasted like what and what size they were, and how meaty they were, and how they were in terms of texture. My favorites were the beach angels from BC, but I don't remember any of the others ones that we had.\n\nAs for the baked oysters, they were AWESOME. The Royale was my favorite since it had crab on the top, but the Rustico followed closely behind. The Gruyere on the top was a great touch. I also liked the Rockerfeller- the fennel in it didn't have that licorice flavor so I ate a bunch of them. We also had the frites with curry sauce. The curry sauce was sooo good! \n\nI will definitely be back. I loved the food and the staff at Oyster Boy and the place was super cute.", 5], ["Only oysters I've had in Toronto were from Rodney's and these are definitely par for the course.\nThe fries are crazy good with their lime aioli, the steamed clams were killer with the broth, and of course all the oysters were fantastic.\nWe had to try their deep fried panko crust oysters, the Cascumpec Bay oysters from PEI, Beach Angel oysters from BC,Wiley Point oysters from Maine, La St.simon oysters from New Brunswick and Copps Island oysters from Conneticut.\nThey're all great but the Beach Angels were my favorite for sure.\nAll oysters come with a side of horseradish of course and a choice of a red wine vinegar base sauce, a traditional seafood sauce and a chipotle base sauce.\n\nI would say Oyster boy has better service than Rodney's, but I would say Rodney's has the better food. May just have to eat at both places back to back to properly compare, which I wouldnt mind at all.", 4], ["Best sea food restaurant! \nStarters are delicious ( def. try spinach crab dip and crab cakes)\nLobster excellent !\nHalibut with veggies and fried onion latest item on the menu I tried and I was not disappointed\nAs for oysters, great variety with different sizes.

What surprised me the most was that he actually took the effort to find out what the issue was and what happened according to my review, indicating that he really cares about his business being well and finding issues that comes up. He offered us a change and improvement to the issues the next time we return to the restaurant. \n \nI told my friends who who vowed not to return after the previous disappointing service and persuaded them to return with me again. We had a BRILLIANT time on a Thursday night  and they saw a few of the servers that they knew from regularly going to oyster boy before. \n\nOysters that we had were amazing, very knowledgable sever whom served us. She kept answering our questions about the oysters when the  free of us were confused with the different choices. \nThe shucker name Tyler was really friendly, made us amazing oyster shots and kept checking on us when we ordered the raw clams (they were amazingly sweet and flavourful btw!)  \n\nThe shellfish salad is my favourite, really worth it for the price! It comes with a bit of everything. \nSturgeon ceviche was a little too citrusy, veryyyy appetizing.\nSteam calms were amazing, every time I order it the taste and flavour is consistent. None of the clams had anyyy sand in it, which makes me a very happy eater!!!\n\nReally want to thank Adam and his team for how they dealt with the whole situation. And also for the wonderful meal.\n\nMy friends will definitely return again and I am very happy for that!!\n\n\n\n-----------------------------\nBusy night. Horrible service by  both our server and the guy that shucked the oysters. \nAmazing service by a guy that was not our server, he was polite and very caring. Great mains too. \n\nMy friend tried to talk to the guy that shucked the oysters for recommendation (Our server barely gave us any answers to the taste profile of the oysters, besides saying everything is amazing).  The guy that shucks the oysters was talking to two ladies sitting at the bar, he kept telling my friend to order from our waiter when my friend told him we were just asking for recommendations.  \n\nThis is the first time at oyster boy or any seafood restaurant, but the server actually served our mains before the oysters and told us our oysters are coming soon. We waited a while for the oyster and was a little surprised so we didn't say anything. \n\nThe mains were amazing, the pasta was very flavourful and just the right amount of sauce. The steak fritz were very marinated well, but tough to chew. Bouillabaisse was really delicious, clams and mussels were cooked just right!\n\nIn the middle of our main the server dropped our oysters. \nThe oysters were badly shucked, they were all a bit sandy and almost every one of them had flakes of shell in it. \n\nI guess the server noticed we weren't very happy and barely came to our table, another server took over our table instead. He was our server previous times we were there (apparently he works Tuesdays a lot). He asked us how our food was when he noticed we didn't finished our oysters and recognized my friends as regulars. We told them about our situation with the oysters and how it came after the main. He was very nice and instead of our server, he apologized to us of what happened. \nOur server never came back to our table, so we asked the nicer server for the bill. \n\nLesson learned....\n-don't go there durning weekends\n-don't go there when they look busy...\n-basically go there only when they are dead or weekday. \n-sit at the bar the guy that shucks the oysters will be nicer\n-only have the skinny server with dirty blonde hair (sorry I forgot his name)\n-have the mains, maybe except the steak", 5], ["Oyster Boy...oh boy!\nDining Experience: Dinner\nSpecialty: Oysters\nMenu items: Oysters, Beer Battered Fish and Chips and Ceviche\n\nIn the heart of downtown Toronto lays a place that offers one of the best food aphrodisiacs ever! Oysters is the specialty of this niche restaurant that came to my knowledge through a friend who swears by it. Not being a fan of oysters, I decided I needed to try them at least once to give this food group a chance. Little did I know I will become one the biggest fans of the little suckers (pun intended) and will become a regular here.\n\nThe way the boy itself, Adam Colquhoun, treats this delicacy is what makes them good. To my enjoyment, and hopefully yours, oysters at Oyster Boy can be eaten raw, cooked, steamed or fried. My favourite kind are always and forever PEI's Malpeques. I usually order about a dozen of them and stick with my choice. Malpeques are actually recognized as one of the world's finest oysters with an unequalled taste, superior appearance and excellent keeping quality. So when I come to Oyster Boy, I know I am definitely in for a treat.\n\nBesides oysters, the boy offers a variety and limited amount of seafood dishes that will compliment your oyster-eating experience very nicely. Oyster Boy's Beer Battered Fish and Chips are no exception.\n\nAccompanied with the Oyster Boy tartar sauce and slaw, this dish is truly mouth-watering and one to check out when visiting the boy. I am not much of a heavy batter person, so I find the light texture of the deep-fried batter actually good. The fries are nothing special, but then again this is a seafood place.\n\nOther great choices at Oyster Boy include their \"special of the day\", which are usually menu items the chef wants to test and introduce. The Ceviche, was a great choice that night. Unlike traditional Peruvian Ceviche (which is the most popular kind), this Ceviche was fused with what tasted like Mote. Mote is husked white corn kernels that have been boiled with charcoal or firewood. The kernels tend to be big and have rather chewy texture with bland taste, however when combined with lime and salt, becomes quite the dish. The Ceviche topped with some fried octopus, gave it a nice crunchy feel, which brought the whole dish together.\n\nWhen visiting Oyster Boy, I would recommend you plan in advance and make a reservation. On weekends it tends to get quite busy and at times the place does not even take a walk-in given that all of its 25-30 spots might be booked for the night.\n\nBuen Provecho,\nViviana.", 5], ["Was in town for a concert at the Ricoh Coliseum. We found this great seafood place just a couple of minutes away. \n\nTasty beers on tap. Had a lager and a nice hoppy ale. I enjoy hoppy beers, IPA's and such. \n\nI have never eaten Oysters before last night. One of my general rules when it comes to eating, the visual aesthetics is very important to me. Oysters do not look visually appetizing, at least to me. My dinner mate convinced me to try them. Normally having a few beers before hand normally will loosen up my inhibitions, not today, no time.  I believe it was one of the owners who brought over a sampler dozen. The plate presentation was nicely prepared with lemons separating the different types, with freshly shaved horseradish in the middle on a bed of ice. He took the time to inform us of each of the different species, and what was the approiate topping to apply.  i was amazed with the different flavor of each one. They slid down my gullet, no problem.  My dinner companion explained to me that i was lucky to experience a fine quality product for the first time. Apparently if they are gamey, your throat might lock up in rejection. I loved the fresh briny taste that lingered on my pallet. \n\nThe main entree that i ordered the fish tacos. Once again, i was not disappointed.  The fish was prepared with a nice breading. The fish had a crispy outside with a nice moist and flaky inside. The sauce that was drizzled over the fish was amazing, had a zingy flavor to it.  My buddy had the lobster roll, it looked very tasty even though i didn't try it. That came with a generous portion of french fries. \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed every aspect of the Oyster Boy. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Toronto area.  The next time I am in the Toronto area, I live about an hour away in Buffalo, NY, I look forward to eating here again. Great location also, plenty of local shops right in the area.", 5], ["Go for the oysters, but not much else.\n\nGot 36 raw oysters, 24 baked oysters, 1 appetizer and 5 mains.\n\nRaw oysters were decent.

I've tried several different places now, and that does not by any account make me an expert, but I am a diehard fan thanks to Oyster Boy.

The dim sum was not the best. Their dim sum meat dishes were alright but the rest were just very mediocre. The har gow had very thick skin, the rice rolls were super large and oily, and the egg tart custard was slimy, but the worst had to be the Japanese menu. Their rolls were really underwhelming, the takoyaki did not taste the greatest, and those BEEF SKEWERS... I have never tasted anything so atrocious. It was cold, tough, and tasted extremely off. It had a very weird tasting sauce on top. \n\nAside from the food, I just felt that my dishes were very unsanitary. We had to switch plates because we noticed how dirty it was. On top of the not so sanitary conditions, the interior design of this place was very dreary and outdated. They definitely need to upgrade this place. The service here was terrible.

I was happy that they'd expanded their AYCE dim sum menu to include Japanese food as well, on weekends.

For example, the har gow skin was pretty thick...they put a weird chili sauce on the salt & pepper tofu. \n\nToilet is clean, so that is a plus!", 3], ["Second time is a charm. First time was a lunch time visit which was chock full of people doing the AYCE thing for the lower daytime price. Second time was a spur of the moment Saturday night at around 8 pm. A friend was in town and we need to eat. Was worried there would be a lineup. No need to worry, as there is a customer lull in the early evening, before the bars get out and after the dinner rush is over. Maybe a half dozen tables meant the service person could give us her full attention.Food is delicious and prepared when ordered, nothing backs up. As usual with a double whammy AYCE of dim sum and sushi, ate too much dim sum and no room left for the sushi. Will be back for a reverse AYCE. Best dim sum is the #140, a shrimp with deep fried tentacles made of batter. Looks and tastes amazing. Always order the 140, even the 420 crowd was impressed!", 4], ["PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. DIM SUM IS HORRIBLE.\n\nWhat a horrible experience. The food was not only disgusting (aka tasteless) but it was undercooked! \n\nYes, that included pork. That is a food safety hazard. And it wasn't just one dish. A few dishes were undercooked, soggy, and tasteless. I can go on but you get the point.", 1], ["I have nothing but good things to say about my experience dining here! \n\n- Great food\n- Great service \n- Open early\n- Accepts credit cards \n- Clean\n\nWhat more could you want! We got there around 9:30am and it was very easy to get a table. They came around with a menu, where you wrote how many items you want. There are no pictures, so make sure that you know the names of the food you want to order. Food came out quick, they refilled tea/water many times and were very nice and welcoming.", 4], ["Been here twice now and I felt the second time the food taste more delicious. Although it was already pretty good. When we first came in at around 1030, the servers ignored us a bit because there were only 2 of them which I get. I probably asked for water 3 times before I actually got it. I mean they have to be prepared for that coz food is salty son! I need to hydrate! Price was cheap for a lunch about $22? And I for sure ate for atleast 2 people. Worth it. Will be back. Will be taking my whole family to this place.", 4], ["Been here plenty of times, but haven't made a review yet!\n\nThe restaurant is typically busy and it takes a bit of time to get seated. Since there are so many customers, the waiters are constantly running around and taking orders. They don't notice that you're waiting to order unless you raise your hand. This isn't your typical dim sum restaurants where the food is being strolled on carts. The food also takes a long time to arrive; they don't come out all at once. Sometimes, the last meal comes out 15 minutes or more after the first meal arrived. However, the food is 95% of the time fresh and hot. The shrimp rice rolls have a gooey texture, which can be disturbing to some and the shrimp they use isn't the typical baby shrimp, but the regular-sized ones. The Baked BBQ Pork Buns are DELICIOUS and are an absolute must-try if you are dining at Rosewood Cuisine. The top is somewhat sweet, but the inside is savory; you get the best of both worlds.  \n\nThey also serve AYCE sushi, which I have yet to try, but it does look tasty! From what I've seen, the sushi is nicely presented. My mom loves this place, so I'll be coming back.", 3], ["I love Virtuous Pie. Excellent service, sausage pizza, pesto pizza, garlic knots, and shaved brussel sprout salad. Vegan but you won't miss the meat and cheese due to their deft culinary skills and ingredients. Eclectic beer menu so order carefully. Lots of families with kiddos and they were all chowing down. We'll definitely be back!!", 5], ["Unlike some other establishments, Virtuous Pie isn't trying to remake a traditional pepperoni pie in a cheese-free and meatless form. Instead, they reinvent pizzas with flavourful vegetarian ingredients and get rid of the vegan cheese all together using a creamy cashew \"mozzarella\" that's drizzled on like sauce.\n\nTake the Stranger Wings ($15), where the chicken is not the mock version but rather deep fried cauliflower nuggets tossed in a slightly sweet and fairly spicy Buffalo sauce. Scallions and a \"blue cheese\" dressing , which tastes uncannily like ranch, is sprinkled on top so that you get a hit of spice and creaminess. Fried shallots and scallions sprinkled over everything for a fresh oniony finish. Of all the pizzas, it was the most flavourful.\n\nTheir Superfunghi ($14) uses a base of wild mushrooms that when toasted creates a meaty quality. There's a light drizzle of cashew mozzarella, herbed potato cream, and a truffle ricotta, leaving the peppery arugula to become another prominent flavour. This pizza was a favourite of the table and adding a few drops of their chili oil (warning, use sparingly) elevates the pie to a whole new level.\n\nSadly, the Street Corn ($14), a version that seems tasty on paper, was the most disappointing of the bunch. The menu simply makes it sound so tempting: garlic paprika butter, feta, cashew mozzarella, and charred corn? Sign me up! But, the corn is so chewy and gummy that they actually sticks to your teeth, not unlike those dreaded caramel squares from Halloween.\n\nWhile I don't know why the corn's texture is so sticky, my hypothesis is that Virtuous Pie uses frozen corn and the garlic butter, when baking, starts to semi fry and dry the kernels. I'd suggest switching to a canned variety and sprinkling the corn onto the pizza after it's cooked, like arugula. The pizza is also nothing like the punchy Mexican street corn, it's in desperate need of seasoning - even if it's just more salt, or better yet, a smoky Cajun dressing.\n\nIn the end, their pizzas may be better described as flatbread topped with flavourful toppings. Crusts come in regular or gluten free form and surprisingly the later form is what impressed the table.\n\nWhile the gluten free version does look like a crispy cracker, behind the crunch there's also a bit of chewiness.  Meanwhile, the regular crust's air pockets makes it look fluffy, but bite through the dough and you're met with a dense hard crust that's oddly similar to the gluten-free varieties of delivery pizza.\n\nVirtuous Pie offers a seasonally changing variety of vegan ice cream, so a flight of three scoops ($8) finished the meal. Although the saffron rose water sounded exotic, the saffron was so overpowering that there's no rosewater essence and it's like eating a savoury ice cream with whole pistachios thrown in. It's definitely an acquired taste, one that no one in our table of five enjoyed... my friend described it best when", 4], ["I have been to Virtuous Pie two times and it's obvious that ingredients are high quality and  dishes are made with care.\n\nHere's what I had:\n\nMac and Cheese Skillet\nSuper cheesy and super flavourful! The texture was creamy from the cheese sauce, chewy from the al dente noods and crunchy from the bacon bits. I would have this dish again. \n\nItalian Meatballs\nThe sauce was very flavourful and the ricotta was rich and tangy. I found the meatball texture to be a little too spongy. Overall, tasty! \n\nRoast Harissa Cauliflower \nI wasn't excited to ordering something I can make at home but this dish turned out very nice - spicy, tangy and perfectly roasted!\n\nPizzas\nI have tried four pizzas over two visits: Artichoke and Chorizo, Grandma Pie, Super Funghi and Calabrese. All were tasty and my favourites were Grandma Pie and Artichoke and Chorizo because the flavour combos were so good! Crust is authentic and chewy. Comes with nice herbed oils and parm on the side!\n\nGelato\nWe tried the Dark Chocolate and Mint and Coffee and Donuts flavours. Both were very creamy! The coffee flavour was nice but I didn't like the donut pieces - they didn't add to the flavours and aded grainy texture to otherwise smooth gelato. To my pleasant surprise, I loved the chocolate-mint. It was the right balance of chocolate and mint for me (which isn't that minty)! Yum!\n\nGo to Virtuous Pie and let me know what you think!", 4], ["It was my first vegan restaurant and I really enjoyed my experience here. I tried savory Brussels sprouts and pesto cbr and sweet pepper + sausage pizzas. The food was delicious and very fresh. The service was great.", 4], ["If you didn't know this place was vegan, I don't think you'd ever be able to tell (aside from the lack of animal products on their menu) because it's just that good! If you want to avoid lineups and a long wait time to get a table, get here early - you'll be able to get a table if you come around 5:30 on a weekday, but you'll end up waiting around 30-45 mins for a table if you wait until 8pm to try this place out! \n\nGarlic knots: Not my favourite dish- I found they didn't have enough of a garlic flavour and didn't exactly have the crispy outside/soft pull-apart inside texture I was looking for. Also got this with one of the mayo dipping sauces but I couldn't really taste much flavour in that either. \n\nSuper funghi pizza: The mushrooms are great (i.e. super flavourful, juicy, soft), but the amount of arugula thrown on top is so overpowering and takes away from the mushroom flavour. I like arugula as a garnish, but this is a little bit much compared to the amount of mushrooms you get. \n\nHarvest pizza: This is my absolute favourite pizza from virtuous pie!! The acorn squash brings such a light and sweet flavour to the pizza, the mushrooms add a good crunchy/juicy texture, and the cashew cheese is beyond amazing. Plus the warm colours of this pizza puts you in such a cheery vibe. \n\nUltraviolet pizza: You gotta like pesto to try this pizza! I think they use pesto as the pizza sauce and it makes the pizza turn out so savoury and full of the basil flavour. The pine nuts add a really nice texture to the pizza - definitely get this one if you want something really savoury. \n\nSuch a great place for pizza especially with the fresh toppings and thin crispy crust! A must-try if you find yourself in this neighborhood!", 5], ["Laid back vegan restaurant, offering pizzas, appetizers, donuts, and ice cream. We tried the SuperFunghi and Stranger Wings pizzas as our main dishes. Both are good and would recommend the Stranger Wings if you are looking for something spicy. The only observation I have is that both pizzas did not have a base sauce as usual pizzas have. But the crust is thin, the vegan cheeses are great substitutes for the regular cheese, and they don't skimp on toppings so it is delicious overall. We also ordered the mint chip and coffee and doughnut ice cream. Both are good and on the lighter side, it is not too heavy and creamy. The place is small but when we went on a Friday night, it was not packed and got a table right away. I also like that there is a water fountain with still and sparkling water. You can also order through UberEats.\n\nTip: It is a self-service restaurant, get a table, then walk to the end of room to place your order. They will give you a number to place on your table and your food will be delivered.", 4], ["This vegan place is outstanding.  From the menu, it's easy to miss the fact that it's vegan.  We had the calabrese pie and chorizo and artichoke pie.  Both were savoury but my favourite was the chorizo and artichoke. Their serving sizes are healthy given their prices and topped with just the right amount of topping.\n\nInside, you can watch your pizza being made or just relax at your table.  It's a cozy spot with a handful of dine-in tables.  There are also a few other vegan options other than the pizza.  We had the meatballs and an ice cream float.  Would definitely recommend the float.  Would certainly recommend trying if you like pizza!", 4], ["Virtuous Pie is the first foray of this established west coast vegan restaurant in Toronto. With two locations in Vancouver and one in Portland, their philosophy centers around creating delicious food that is healthy for our bodies and sustainable for our planet. Their menu is focused on 100% plant-based handcrafted pizzas and ice-creams.\n\nVirtuous Pie is located in the heart of Little Italy, with easy TTC access and parking available on College and nearby streets. Decor is simple and bright. Seating consists of three booths, five tables for two that can be pushed together, chairs at a counter facing the front window, and chairs on a counter facing the kitchen. The ordering counter is located at the back of the restaurant. After placing and paying for your order, you are given a number on a stand and food is brought to your table. Self-serve still and sparkling water are available on tap at a counter on the side.\n\nWe started our meal with an order of Garlic Knots (house made knots, fresh Parmesan, garlic ranch). What a delightful start of a meal. The order comes with four warm knots, sprinkled with cheese and cilantro, and garlic ranch on the side. They were absolutely delicious, with great texture and flavor, especially when dipped in the garlic ranch. \n\nOur second small plate was Mac+Cheese Skillet (creamy cashew cheese sauce, penne pasta, bacon bits, fresh Parm). I love that the mac&cheese was served in the iron skillet, as it kept the food warm longer, and created a lovely baked cheese crust around the edges. The creamy cashew cheese sauce tasted like Cheddar cheese and had subtle complexity in its flavor. The bacon bits were a nice touch to the dish.\n\nI decided to try the Margherita Pizza (San Marzano, cashew mozzarella, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil) and see what the kitchen can do with such simple ingredients. The pizza crust was tasty and very thin, which I enjoyed, but it also made the pizza get cold relatively quickly. The cashew mozzarella was awesome, really great taste.\n\nService was friendly. Highly recommended.", 5], ["Definitely one of the better vegan pizza places that I have been to. The pizzas are well assembled and comes with unique topping combinations. However, my superfunghi pizza to be a little bland in flavor, as I was expecting the mushrooms to really bring a earthly bite. \nI have a hard time not comparing it to the non-vegan version because I'm use to pizzas having multiple textures and sharp flavors. It was okay, but I'm not completely sold.\n\nThe seating arrangement is a little confusing. I think it is suppose to be self-serve but when it gets busy there is someone to help direct the crowds. Definitely a smaller space so don't come with a large group.", 3], ["As a vegan living in Toronto, I was excited that another pizza joint opened up! However, after going to Apiecolypse Now! I would only give this restaurant 4 stars but mainly because I personally see pizza as more of a junk food choice for me so that's what I'm looking for when I go out for pizza.\n\nIf you want a healthier alternative though, I definitely recommend Virtuous Pie. The staff were incredibly friendly. I was greeted immediately as I walked in and the staff were quick to clear tables. You get your own water from the refill station and there was the choice of sparkling water as well.\n\nI ordered the Stranger Wings pizza after looking at online reviews and I was not disappointed. The cauliflower was delicious and the pizza was flavourful. I would definitely recommend dining in if you order the Stranger Wings pizza however, because from other reviews (from their Vancouver locations), people complained that the cauliflower got soggy which I can see happening if you keep it long inside a pizza box.\n\nI would also get there early because it tends to get busy in the evenings. I went the day after opening day (during a Friday evening) around 5:30pm and even though the restaurant was fairly new, there was only one open table left.", 4], ["I wanted to try everything on the menu! Not often you come across a Vegan \"junk food\" restaurant. They serve pies (i.e. pizza), max & cheese, and ice cream. A super pleasant and clean space with friendly staff. The pizza flavours are super creative and all sounded amazing. We came at rush hour so it was understood why we had to wait a bit longer than normal for our food. The pizzas looked pretty small initially but I was satisfied at the end of my meal. Overall, a great option for my Vegan friends out there! I'll be back again.", 5], ["I am thrilled that this Vancouver 100% planted based pizza, snacks and ice cream joint has made its way to Toronto.  I tried the new College location last night with friends.  Before arriving, I did not realize it was quick service so you need to order at the cash.  The ordering process could have been more efficient seeing as the three of us had to stand up to order and pay.  Menus at the table could also make this process more efficient so that people wouldn't stall in line when ordering or the ability to pay at the end so the entire table doesn't need to stand up.  There aren't a lot of tables so I can imagine on a weekend, this place must be packed (I was there on a Tuesday)!\n\nNow onto the food.  I had the super fungi pizza which was such a treat because as someone who can't eat dairy, I rarely get to enjoy creamy truffle dishes.  I loved that the pizza was a perfect size for one person (10 inch thin crush) topped with plenty of arugula.  We also shared the mac and cheese skillet which tasted like the real thing and stayed warm throughout.\n\nThey have a flight of three ice cream flavours for $8 but since we wanted to try a variety, we got one flight and one bowl: vanilla bourbon, coffee and donuts,  gingerbread and rocky road.  The vanilla tasted creamy and full of flavour.  The other flavours were less impressive as they had more of an icy texture.\n\nEither way, I look forward to going back and would also try ordering (hopefully these pizzas travel well!)", 4], ["Overall, I liked every single thing that I tried. I had tried about 4 different pizzas. All were thin but very heavy on the toppings, so definitely worth it for the $11-$15. \n\nThe restaurant itself was slick and modern with a casual feel.

But if you do like pesto, the combination with roasted tomatoes and pine nuts is amazing!", 5], ["We had a pretty sad experience here. We're vegan Americans who were visiting Toronto and Virtuous Pie was on a lot of popular vegan food lists so we added it to our list. We came in around 8 on a Friday night and this was our first time here. I was walking up towards the front since I didn't know if we grabbed our own tables or someone seated us. It was pretty packed and busy so it wasn't totally clear. A waitress stopped me on my way to the front to add me to the waitlist and told us to sit at the stools at the front to wait and she would let us know when something opened up. \n\nWe ended up waiting for over an hour and half sitting there and waiting, at which point I saw people come in and sit at the stools right next to us and get their food, while we were still waiting.\n\nSeeing that they just got here and got food and we were still waiting, I went to ask and found a different waitress. I asked how much longer it would take and pointed out that it looked like people who were just coming in were getting food before us. She checked for me and came back to us with the original waitress who had put us down on the list. I saw something like embarrassment (since she obviously messed up) cross her face and she then seated us at a different table without any apology, when it was pretty obvious that the stools we were seated at, at the front, were seats too. She asked if we had been there before and I said no and she explained that the way it worked here was that we go up to the front and order and they bring our food to us.\n\nIt was probably an honest mistake that she forgot about us but I didn't appreciate having to wait hungry for so long with no acknowledgment or compensation of her mistake.\n\nI went up and paid with a credit card. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and the funghi pizza as our main. The meatballs were whatever, didn't really like them, but the funghi pizza was good. \n\nI think my experience was severely impacted by service. Since our pizza was good, the others probably are as well. I'm hopeful that this was a one off experience and their service is usually better.", 2], ["I came here the other night for dinner with my cousin. We split the Cesar salad, the cauliflower, and each got our own pizza. I got the funghi. Everything we ate was phenomenal and so flavourful. I didn't want it to end!! The Cesar was one of the best plant based salads I've ever tried, the harissa on the cauliflower was to die for and the pizza was like a party in my mouth. 10/10 would return in a heartbeat! I should also mention that I'm a huge carnivore :p", 5], ["So so so good. I am incredibly impressed with the menu items, variety, and high quality of food this place serves! Great serving sizes to share and they give a great amount of toppings.\n\nWe ordered the garlic knots, Calabrese Pizza, Margherita Pizza, and the mac + cheese. Our favourite was the Margherita Pizza and the garlic knots for their simplicity and flavour.

This place is great and we'll have to go back sometime. Haven't had a nice thin crust vegan pizza in ages. I went with people who weren't vegan and they loved it. The only thing that people should be aware of are the prices. Like I said the quality of the ingredients are very good and everything is 100% vegan so this place might be on the pricey side for some people or if you're a student on a budget. However, it is still standard and around the same as other restaurant establishments in the city so I'm sure almost everyone can go. If I lived in the area it'd be hard for me not to Virtuous Pie every day because the pizzas are amazing. ;)", 5], ["I've tried the original Virtuous Pie in Vancouver and this is definitely on par with the pizza quality. Extremely thin crust without being dry and the toppings were fresh & flavourful. \n\nSince I'm very lactose-sensitive, I am SOOO impressed and happy with how awesome Virtuous Pie nails non-diary pizzas. I'm shocked at how similar vegan cashew alternatives can simulate the creaminess of 'alfredo' sauce or cheesiness of ricotta/mozzarella.

Both were amazing, but the Chorizo was a bit more flavourfully unique.", 5], ["Tasty vegan pizza alternative! \n\nMy partner and I are not vegans but enjoy mixing in a lot of plant based fare, so we decided to try this place out. \n\nPros:\n\nThe garlic knots are delicious.\nThe fake cheese (and meatballs!) are impressive - they don't taste quite like the real thing but you won't miss it much.\nReasonably priced!\nThe artichoke pizza is solid. \n\nCons: \n\nNo table service, but no one told us, so we waited a good 15 minutes, hungry and confused, in a very busy place before we figured it out. Don't make our mistake. \nThe buffalo cauliflower pizza is just ok. \n\nOverall, I always think vegan food shortsells itself by naming its foods after nonvegan foods as it begs comparison, and that comparison is rarely favourable and a bit unfair.

Bovis gained experience at fish-focused restaurant Ufficio, and some similarities translate to Wynona's menu.

It was paired with plump figs, ham, honey, almond, and fennel pollen. Like an elevated charcuterie board, it played with a range of tastes and textures -- from briny to salty, and finishing with a sweet note. The cold-cut style ham practically melted dans ma bouche, but I would have liked to see less of it on the plate or perhaps removed it altogether, as its saltiness overpowered the cheesy star of the dish.\"", 4], ["Been here twice for brunch and both times were great!

The noodles were perfectly al dente. My partner had the rutabaga agnolotti with ramp butter and potato crumb. For something in a butter sauce, it felt surprisingly light and perfectly cooked.   The only minor complaint is that the dishes were a bit on the small side, so you'll definitely want to try some appetizers. \n\nFor dessert, we shared tiramisu which was great and fairly sizeable. \n\nOverall, the service was great.

The kitchen takes up the back half of the restaurant so you can see the chefs at work while you sip on a drink from their extensive organic wine menu. \n\nTo start we ordered the burrata with fig and ham. The waitress suggested we also order the focaccia to eat with it so we had that well. However when it arrived at the table it was pretty burnt so we were surprised they would even let it out of the kitchen. The burrata was great though and a pretty well sized portion for an appetizer. The figs were also the biggest I've ever seen in my life lol. \n\nFor our mains we had the carrot agnolotti which stole our hearts. The pasta was bite sized and filled with carrot puree and maple butter. Wow. It was just so delicious and I love how small the pieces were which made it easy to eat but just wish there was more of it! \n\nFor our second main we got the pork chop which was perfectly cooked. The meat was super tender and it was really fatty and delicious. I also liked how the green beans weren't overcooked and still had a bit of a crunch to it. \n\nI had such a good time here and will definitely be back to try their other dishes! I would definitely make reservations ahead of time as it is quite a small restaurant.", 5], ["3.5 experience - we came for the summerlicious and the dinner was a whopping 45 dollars each- but the food was just ok. I had the whole fish which was probably the best thing on the menu. Very tiny portions, and too simple.

I probably won't come back even though it is just a stones throw from home.", 3], ["Incredible and delicious. Unique, simple dishes done right! Definitely recommend coming here!", 5], ["Not great. Ridiculously overpriced wine list. No doubt ordered by restaurateur from a private wine distributor, so who knows what the markup is and forget about picking up another bottle of chosen wine for your pleasure at home! Food was lovely, even though I did not get what I ordered! I was also \"corrected\" by the server explaining that \"Confit\" is the way it is cooked and not the piece of duck\"...really?? I know the difference between breast of duck, which is what I was served and charged for, and duck confit pasta, which is what I ordered and did not get. She did offer to take it back but I switched with my husband and ate some bream. I was embarrassed  and annoyed she would incorrectly correct me in front of my compadres and it was also irritating that she kept running her hands though her hair as she spoke to us!

We all did wine pairing which we all enjoyed very much.", 4], ["A nice little neighbourhood restaurant: casual and relaxed, though a little noisy at times (maybe I'm just sensitive to noise). Service was pleasant and accommodating, and the kitchen is solid. Pasta was delicious, and the fish we had was fresh and perfectly cooked. We had sardines and focaccia as an appetizer. I've never had sardines before, so I would say... only order them if you like sardines. I don't think I'd order them again. The bread was ok. Not stellar, but decent. Mains were definitely the highlight.", 4], ["Happy I found this nut-free cupcake shop from cityallergy.guide (they recommend allergy friendly places in Toronto) - being allergic to nuts, most bakeries are off limits and the few that remain aren't very good IMO.  The cake is moist and tasty, the frosting is delicious - in the strawberry frosting you actually taste strawberry which was a nice surprise compared to the artificial nastiness you get at most places.  I'll definitely go back. Their packaging needs work though, the frosting completely drooped off after the 5 minute walk back to the office.", 4], ["Love the cupcakes here! Got a mocha caramel cupcake but it didn't really taste like mocha lol. Still tasty! If you're not a fan of too much frosting this won't be the place for you.

They also add seasonal flavors to their menu. Their cupcakes are always moist and the icing is delicious. The strawberry icing is great if you don't want something too sweet.

At the time large /standard size clearly way too large. Cupcakes looks beautiful and smells great at the store and when you open the box. Sadly that's probably the end of great experience. I came at 3 pm and there was very little selection left only 3-5 standard flavours and got the red velvet, chocolate frosting on chocolate, lemon frosting on vanilla, strawberry frosting on chocolate,  another of the same with a t shirt chocolate piece on top and then I was doubling the flavours to get to the 6 pack box. The cupcakes were so sweet and clearly unhealthy. There's no real fruit flavor it's all artificial. It's not a peanut free facility either so half the kid population / clientele is gone. It's a nice treat at the medium size but still way too much sugar than what an adult should even have. Box they give you not great holder because when you get home it will be slightly squished. I guess when you get cupcakes you're accepting that it's going to be bad for you. We had one cupcake per person the same day. The next day everything was hardened and stale which I didn't expect. There's 4 cupcakes still in the box which are going into the garbage and complete waste of $16 plus tax for 6 medium size cupcakes. Don't waste your time and money.", 1], ["If you like icing more than cake, this is your guy. I would say the cupcake was 80% icing. I got the Chocolate strawberry.\n\nThe icing produced a strong creme cheese strawberry taste. The cake however didn't taste anything like Chocolate. \n\nSince there was so much icing it was a really hard and messy to eat. The cupcake kept falling apart. There's tons of options to pick from. It's a hole in the wall in the PATH, lots of signs pointing to it. 2/5.", 2], ["Upgraded my rating to 4 stars because I have ordered cupcakes regularly from this location over the past 4 years and they have been consistently excellent every time.

I thought the icing to cupcake ratio was a bit too much icing but the icing was really good- it was fluffy and sweet and that's a lot coming from someone who always scrapes off the icing but i heard this place was really good. I would definitely recommend it but maybe get the regular sized one as this was about 2.5 bites", 4], ["Service at this location is consistently bad. The last 3 times I've been here the person at the cash seems like they just don't want to be there and couldn't care less about providing good service. \n\nUsually I would overlook the service because the cupcakes were consistently delicious. \n\nWhen I visited today and got 4 different mini cupcakes, I found them to be very dry and lacking in texture. \n\nI wouldn't return to this location again.", 2], ["Just popped in to try their cutie sized red velvet cupcake. The cake part of the cupcake was pretty moist which was a welcome change as my experience with cupcake bottoms tend to be on the dry side.\n\nDownside was that the frosting was kind of grainy and sickenly sweet. Even though I know I'm ingesting pure sugar, I don't actually want to be reminded of that lol. \n\nI think that if they made their frosty more fluffy,  lighter tasting and less sweet, that I would definitely think about coming back for more.

I passed by it a couple weeks ago and vowed I'd indulge one day after work! For about $2.5 each, I got a mini red-velvet cream cheese cupcake and my friend got the Almond Joy. \n\nI'm usually not the biggest fan of cream-cheese frosting but this was particularly tasty! The frosting was soft and sweet, definitely not overpowering. The cupcake was really moist and not crumbly at all. \n\nI took a bite of my friend's Almond Joy, which was the special edition cupcake of the week. When you first bite into it, the coconut flavour hits you immediately. It's pretty light and compliments the base cupcake really nicely. I couldn't really taste the almond though. Similar to the red-velvet, it was really light. \n\nSo Prairie Girl cupcakes come in three sizes: cutie, mini, and regular. The mini was an okay size but I will  definitely get regular next time (so delicious!!) I would recommend getting a mini or a cutie if you're just trying a new flavour and don't want to completely commit to an entire cupcake.", 4], ["My first foray into Prairie Girls - a holiday treat for my family-didn't end well!

Both were very, very good. \nSo good - that I went to the PATH location to purchase another Vanilla Bean. YES. \nThank you, Prairie Girl.", 4], ["I passed by this place almost every single day and finally decided to give this bakery a try.  I really like cupcake, and my favourite would be the vanilla buttercream frosting.  It is situation close to the intersection between King St and Victoria.  I was kind of surprise by the decks of box blocking the left side windows of the store.  Shouldn't these boxes be placed in storage where it is hidden.  lol!  Once I was in the store I immediately noticed the beautiful fondant display cakes toward the left side of the store.  I love the gum paste flowers on some of the cakes, they were lovely.  The place is beauifully decorated with a pastel colour tone as the background.\n\nI was ready to order couple of the mini size cupcakr for a try.  However, I found the menu extremely confusing.  I really couldn't figure out which cupcake coordinate with which cost.  And I kind of stood there for 7 minutes before I was attended to.  There were not even serving customers.  They were just stocking their shells with cupcakes.   I found this kind of unacceptable, because they notice me standing there but did not acknowledge me at all.   I was really patience as I wanted to try the white chocolate strawberry and malted cupcakes.  Finally, the cashier has time for me after she finished stocking the shelf.  \n\nI broght two mini size cupcakes with tax for $5.10 and I found it kind of pricey; I really hope for good flavour.  The white chocolate strawberry cupcake was absolutely delicious as it balance the acidity of the strawberry with the creamy white chocolate flavour.  I do find that the chocolate cupcake base to be moist and fluffy.", 3], ["Cupcakes taste so good and are so filling!

Probably won't return, not worth the $$$", 2], ["This is such a cute store. My friend and I walked by here when we were taking an after lunch walk at work. The store has good presentation on its cupcakes and cookies.

But then factor into the nice packaging I guess it's still acceptable. You pay for the experience and enjoyment.\n\nTaste wise it was BADDDDD. My goodness the icing was way too sweet, like even sweeter than donuts. I got so sick after I finished my cupcake.

I love everything about this place. The cupcakes are super moist and the frosting is super flavourful. The best cupcakes I've ever tried. I love the red velvet and carrot flavour. I would recommend eating it  the day of or the day after latest as the frosting tends to dry quick. During certain occasions/ holidays they have limited flavours. I prefer the mini size overall. The classic is huge and only get it if you are only planning to have one cupcake and the cutie size is quite small (more bite size). They also specialize in cake as well (More on the pricer side). The bakery is generally closed by 6. Be sure to grab the cupcakes earlier. You would also need to pay for parking as it is located in Toronto.", 5], ["This place doesn't really live up to the hype and excitement its gets.  I got a golden buttermilk strawberry cupcake and the cake was a tad on the dry side and the icing was verging on too sweet.  \n\nThe staff there are pretty friendly, but the cupcake flavours really aren't that unique, they tend to stick to very traditional, \"classic\" ones. Prices are on the high side, for the quality of cupcake you get though.", 2], ["This place was getting pretty full when we arrived. Luckily, I had made reservations in advance as I like knowing that I have a table at a popular restaurant. The staff were extremely accommodating even though I originally only reserved for 3 people, informed them it would actually only be 2 upon arrival, and then it actually ended up being 4 people. They honestly must have believed that we were the most disorganized group to ever grace their establishment but it was honestly just due to a lack of communication between me and my friends haha \n\nOur waiter was extremely informative and friendly throughout our whole meal. When asked about their Killer Chicken Sandwich, he hyped it up a lot! To the point where my friend had extremely high expectations going into the sandwich that were not met, even though he did say it was delicious. Perhaps it needn't be hyped up as much as it was but that's just a personal opinion! I honestly regretted not ordering it upon seeing the sandwich get placed in front of my friend....\n\nAnyways, onto the food I did feast on ~ \n\n[Crispy Buffalo Chicken Tacos] $9.98 - this dish comes with two tacos that were plenty filling. The tacos had deep fried chicken pieces tossed in buffalo sauce, aged cheddar, jalapeno-monterey jack, their very own salsa, gorgonzola flavored ranch, lettuce and fresh lime! These were delicious but definitely avoid this if you can't handle spicy foods. I would definitely get this again despite how messy my eating ending up being due to my inexperience with eating soft tacos haha \n\n[Roasted Vegetable Firecrackers] $9.48 - mmmm, we ended up ordering this to share between the four of us who were eating together! I had read some reviews that recommended firecrackers from this place so we opted for the vegetarian ones to try. The vegetarian ones are packed full of sweet peppers, onions, spinach, cremini mushrooms, cream cheese, feta, goat cheese and sweet chilli sauce! These were extremely heavy so given that there were only four pieces, one per person was plenty so keep that in mind if you're ordering it to share :D \n\n[Latte] $4 - no pictures of it but goodness gracious, this is one of few cups of coffee I've had that wasn't bitter in the least bit! It was delicious without sugar, so much so, that I would have gladly had 8 more cups if they were free. I definitely needed a caffeine boost because the film we were seeing after dinner began at a much later time than I'm used to being out so I highly recommend ordering this too! \n\nHighly recommend this place if you're in the area and want some good food before a movie or just in general :D", 5], ["My first time here having walked passed it many times was with a group of 7 on a Friday evening for happy hour at 6pm. We made reservations online which was simple enough and were seated immediately upon arrival, the restaurant wasn't extremely busy at the time. It's nice that they have daily drink specials and that they offer them on weekends as well since many restaurants only have specials from Sunday through Thursday, drink specials for Friday were $5 bottles of Corona or glasses of Peller Estate wine. \n\nService was exceptional, our waitress came back every so often to check on us, but not so often to disturb our conversation. The manager also made the rounds to each table to make sure things were ok and to see if it was our first time visiting the establishment which was a classy move, it isn't very often that I see restaurant managers doing this but is an effective way to let customers know that they prioritize customer service. \n\nI was feeling like a burger that evening and was deciding between the cheeseburger and the mushroom melt, and after consulting the waitress, I went with the mushroom burger. The dish looked great aesthetically and was served with a mountain of fries but I felt the burger itself lacked some salt and seasoning. It didn't taste bad at all, there was just nothing outstanding about it. The fries were also average, hot but not crispy, edible but unexciting. The food for me didn't hit the mark, but looking around the table at the other dishes (chicken tenders, flatbread, other burgers) I may have just chosen the wrong dish for my appetite. \n\nPrices were good if you take advantage of their drink specials, ambiance was quite nice, not too dark, loud or cramped.

He suggested dishes with great vigor and made light conversation--it was an all-round great time!\n\nI ordered the chicken panang noodle bowl, which is quite lovely. It was everything I expected in the dish and was quite a large portion. I will say it's nothing revolutionary, but it got the job done. \n\nAt the end of the day, is the food worth the price tag? Probably not.

Nothing has changed for me. Hubby & I came here for a lunch one Saturday. It wasn't that busy & sometimes that's nice. It was still a tad early for lunch so they did get busier as our meal went on.

Drink specials wine $6. Both of our orders were more than enough food, it was very filling and I could have brought some home. My friend didn't even finish her burger. \n\nStaff: The staff was very friendly, a very young and cool vibe here.

There wasn't too much wine in the glass, so I'd stick to the Coronas next time.\n\nI ordered the blackened bowties pasta which was surprisingly really delicious! I'm a little picky with how I like my pasta and I really liked this dish. It's also a pretty big portion, and both of us had to pack half of our pastas to go.\n\nIf I worked closer to this area I'd probably come regularly for patio season. The patios nice, the foods great, the price is right. \n\nAlso, side note that their GM is amazing! She goes from table to table to make sure everyone's enjoying their food.

I had the Chicken Vindaloo which wasn't remotely Indian in flavor, it was a decent herbed Chicken with fresh if bland rice.  The Calamari with chili sauce was the best thing on the table - a little more batter-heavy than I like but tasty and not tough to chew at all. Pulled Pork Poutine was OK, I'd say fires were a touch better than Astor's.  My mom's Sirloin & Fries were also just OK. The guy who brought us here was happy with his Mushroom Burger - looked to me like something you could get for $5 less at lots of places.  \n\nAs others have noted, it was quite noisy from a combination of music, loud groups and the TVs, not comfortable for conversation. And the elevated area in the back was very dark even at 2PM, I had difficulty reading the menu.  . \n\n They gain extra points for their capacity and the long hours, but lose some points for the difficult parking in the area and overall value proposition.

The Pattie in the mushroom melt was burnt.. what's worse was that half of the chicken in my burger was black... Even the hamburger buns were burnt. I felt like I was eating charcoal. I really don't understand how a restaurant can take 30 minutes only to serve completely burnt burgers and over cooked fries. \n\n\nPlease stay away.

I ordered the dynamite rolls and poutine with chicken - the rolls were basically balls of rice and surprisingly had lettuce in them... And the poutine was cold and bland. The other dishes my friends ordered were also cold.

Which is a shame as it always has good potential to be a relaxed local place. Good luck trying to get them to change the TV to show whatever game is on tonight, and that's when you can actually get their attention. If you are at the upstairs patio, they can't even change the channel without calling someone downstairs to do it.\n\nLoud obnoxious music, definitely not really a dinner spot.

Also ordered the flatbread and it was good enough to share! Lettuce could have been a bit more fresh but overall the taste was fair.

They are spectacular, and worthy of a 5 star review all on their own. \n\nToday I got the Buddha bowl with soba noodles and swapped the regular tofu cubes for crispy ones.\n\nEverything was delicious, as per usual.

Since it is vegan I asked what the cheese was made out of. The server told me it was coconut oil based. I didn't have high expectations but the \"cheese\" was actually amazing and the sliders were pretty good too. I wouldn't say it tastes just like meat but it also doesn't taste like a typical veggie burger either. I would definitely come back.

Just in case you were going there to lose weight. Keep that in mind.", 4], ["I was really disappointed with this location. I have gone to other Fresh locations for years and always had great experiences but this one was not good.\n\nI'll preface this by saying I work in the hospitality industry and am usually very forgiving of mistakes. We ordered drinks and food with our server but the drinks didn't show up and our server was no where to be found for us to ask if they were still coming. We remained patient but saw that a table near us (who was seated long after us) got their food first. We had to flag the waiter down from very far away and ask if our drinks and food were still on their way (this was about 40 minutes after ordering). He said he would look into it ( he didn't appear puzzled at all that we hadn't gotten drinks or food yet). He came back and said he forgot to punch in our order. So he went and punched in our drinks and food but was not very apologetic about forgetting us. Our drinks and good were dropped off not long after by other staff members, our waiter never checked in on us to see how we were doing. After sitting with dirty plates for quite a while after eating we eventually had to flag another server down and ask for our bills. Our waiter came with the bills and collected his tips but it left me feeling like he really didn't do much for us.\n\nI understand that serving is a lot of multitasking but the restaurant was definitely not busy enough to completely neglect a table and not respond appropriately after our server clearly made a mistake by not punching in our order after 40 minutes. He should have been in his section more frequently surveying his tables to see that they got everything they ordered. And once a mistake was made, he should have involved a manager to come by and just acknowledge what happened. I was not looking for free stuff by any means, I just know that once a mistake is made at a table, the server should be making sure that the rest of that table's service is flawless and we didn't get that.\n\nAgain, I really like Fresh's food and atmosphere but I will not be returning to this location again because of this poor service experience.", 1], ["They really made plant-based food accessible to anyone and made non-vegan staples available for people on a plant-based diet.\n\nHowever, I've been going there since 2012 and they've recently increased the prices, which I don't think reflects the quality of the food.\nI'm assuming they are trying to compete with higher-end vegan restaurants, but given the rate at which vegan restaurants are opening in town, I personally have been going to other restaurants with prices that are truer to the quality of the food.\n\nFor anyone looking for good value for money, their cauliflower taco is delicious and only $13.5.

She offered some mushroom gravy instead but I said it's too late as I've eaten the onion rings already. This seemed to really put her off and she abruptly and rudely just walked away.

Not that Fresh on Bloor is flavourless or actively tries to be that way but the service here is definitely is on the 'don't care about you' part.  \n\nThe space here is much bigger than the Spadina spot with less crowding.   BUT If you're seated by the walls, it's possible to be seating on another table's lap... and that's not an exaggeration.  Similar to the Spadina spot, there was a HUGE wait on a Sunday lunch time.  Sad thing is that they could have easily reduced it by actually paying attention to the tables.  So many times we could have easily ordered in the first 10 minutes but we didnt get anyone's attention until 25 minutes later.  We could have left 10 minutes earlier as well... but trying to flag someone done to get our cheques... good luck.  \n\nBuffalo Cauliflower - A great starter as it's crunchy with a bit of heat and vinegar to keep it interesting.  I found this version a bit more heavily breaded and more oilier than the Spadina one.  It's close to the Spadina version but I would say the Bloor one was just not as good.  Still a solid app and would probably order it from another spot.  3.5/5\n\nAll star salad - I tried a new one and I think the falafel salad is definitely the better tasting one.  I'm not saying this one was lacklustre but I felt half the bowl was just plain quinoa which is good from a protein perspective.  But from a taste perspective, I would have liked more sweet potato or tomatoes... something!  I felt the original dressing was probably too light in flavour as well.  I hit the vegetable with a bit of the hot sauce and it perked up the vegetables.  Another thing, it is a generous bowl... I can easily make 2 meals out of it and it also costs $16 before tax and tip.  Affordable for a single meal?  Possibly not.  3.5/5\n\nBlack Bean Burrito - A Mexican take on their wraps, this one was filled with black bean, avocado, cilantro, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, onions, cucumber, and Mexican hot sauce.  It also has a gooey sauce which they call 'fresh cheese'.  Overall, this was a big portion.  Definitely meal size and the burrito easily was 4 inches across.  From a price perspective, it was a decent value.. you could make it 2 smaller meals if you wanted.  As for flavour and texture, the addition of the hot sauce made it more than just a salad in a wrap.  I felt this was a lot of soft mushier parts... I would have appreciated a good crunch to shake it up.  3.5/5\n\nSwoosh power shakes - This is one expensive shake.. $8.50 for a medium.  When it arrived to the table, it was more generous than I anticipated and with the ingredients of Peanut butter, dark cocoa, maple syrup, banana, cinnamon, and almond milk, I was anticipating a really thick shake.  It definitely was and it was potently sweet as well.  You can really taste the chalkiness of the dark cocoa and it almost felt like it had a big scoop of protein powder.  The cinnamon and banana added to the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Overall, not bad... $8.50 though? not sure.  3.5/5\n\nI think the service unfortunately made the whole experience less than stellar.  The staff pretty much avoided acknowledging you even if you did grab their eye contact several times.  I'm not sure how this place keeps super packed with that and the slow service PLUS it's not cheap.  Sure, it's generous portions but for most people, $19 salad with tax and tip is more than most people can afford.", 3], ["The food here was so good but the service was so shit. The waiter we had had so much attitude and she barely came to our table to wait on. She continuously sounded like she hated being there and I am not one to judge, maybe she had a shitty day? I don't know, but she was so rude. She was much nicer to the other tables surrounding us and she seemed to be annoyed that there were 5 of us... she should have just taken the day off. We felt so uncomfortable that we didn't get dessert and got it somewhere else. Anyways, at the end, we all tipped her 15% even though SHE WAS SHITTY... and just when we were leaving she said to us \"you guys are terrible\" .....beyond mind blown.

I've recently noticed that the side salad option that comes with the wrap has been eliminated, which is a shame as the plating just looks sad with two halves of a wrap (it's really missing something else...like the side salad!) The Buddha bowl has marinated tofu, so many different veggie toppings, and the most tasty peanut sauce. A little on the pricy side, but it's definitely worth it. Fresh also has one of the best hot sauces I've ever tasted, and I've been guilty of loading it liberally on to my food - which really makes it 10000% even more yummy. \n\nThe downside is the seating and staff. The tables are so close together that sometimes it's difficult to get out, and when you try to your butt is basically in your neighbour's face. The staff is rude and does not care about you, which is a shame as the food is so great the restaurant really deserves 5 stars, but the service knocks it down to a 3. What's worse is that the machine has 3 options to tip (18, 20, or 22 percent), which is extremely undeserved. \n\nTl;dr\nFresh is delicious and worth every penny, but be warned of the terrible service and cramped dining area.", 3], ["This place was pretty good.

I have no idea if it was competitive with other vegan places because I haven't visited a vegan only restaurant in years.

At $59 per person, it is not a bad deal for the great selection of food you're getting, and getting to enjoy the live jazz band while you're brunching is a plus.\n\nThis time around, it was an amazing birthday celebration for my dad, from beginning to end! The hostess was friendly, offered to hang our winter coats, and came back to check up on us and my dad to make sure he was enjoying himself. Our server, Christopher, was lovely - he gave us a tour and came by to surprise my dad with a birthday cake and candle, while the wonderful trio jazz band played \"Happy Birthday\". Best part was that my dad turned 74 this year, so he got 74% off his meal with Ricarda's birthday special. Love it!\n\nAnd near the end, when the fluffy pancakes ran out, I asked the pancake station cook if there were any more, and he surprised me by having the chef especially make me some special lemon ricotta pancakes that they don't usually have on Sunday brunch days. It was so sweet of him to come up to me unexpectedly with the pancakes and I enjoyed it thoroughly with the airiest and freshest vanilla bean whipped cream (you can see the vanilla bean black dots in it!) and wild blueberry compote. It tasted like cloud 9! Needless to say, the service was fantastic!\n\nRest of the food was great as always - oysters were fresh; foie gras was tasty and I'm always a fan of the grilled eggplant and the DIY s'mores bar with the roast your own marshmallows! Only thing that could've made it perfect was if the hot carving stations with the prime rib, porchetta and glazed salmon were hotter temperature wise and the meats more tender. Other than that, I can always count on Ricarda's for a good time and the best Sunday brunch ever!", 5], ["Update: As seen below Ricarda's rep indicated they would contact me but it's been well over a month now and no contact or update. I see how they truly feel about customer reviews now. They claim to want to fix things but this is likely just lip service. \n\nThis is my second visit to Ricarda's for Sunday Brunch and it was a very different experience than my first. \n\nWe had a reservation for 10:45 but I arrived a bit early and the front desk seemed to have trouble locating our reservation. That was fine since they were nice and offered to hang our coats while we waited. \nAfter a few minutes they were able to find our reservation and we were seated promptly. I liked that the tables were set with children in mind as their settings had colorful plastic dishes. \n\nRicarda's Sunday Brunch is known for their Kids play area, and this weekend was no different. I brought my child over to play and was greeted by Ruth who was there to watch the kids. My kid wasn't really into playing since she was shy but I was able to leave after a while as she was eating the food they set up there for the kids. \n\nThe food selection was decent, an array of fresh seafood, a charcuterie board, salads, breads, pastries and a custom pasta bar. \n\nOur server was where our table had an issue. I understand that there is a 2 hour dining limit. However, on this visit, the server gave us our bill at 1 hour 15 min. We didn't think much of it until he came back at 1 hour 30 min and said how would we like to pay? Our table said \"I thought we had 2 hours, it's only been 1.5 hours\". At this point, we didn't get any apology or that he would check but rather he said \"Fine, whatever\" and stormed off immediately to the hostess where we could see he was complaining. \n\nFor an establishment as nice as this one, we really didn't expect this behavior. He didn't come back to rectify the situation or apologize. A simple check would have shown that he was early and a clarification would have been enough. Instead he spent the rest of the seating ignoring our table so we had a new server assigned to us. It was just an awkward and uncomfortable situation. I think the servers name was Ari. \n\nBetween corralling the kids and trying to feed ourselves we felt like we were rushed as soon as he came over to have us order and pay. Instead we had to speak to a manager who honored our full reservation \n\nThe final wrench was that though I left my child in the care of Ruth, it wasn't long before she wandered back to our table, without her shoes on. Somehow she had gotten past her caregiver and wandered away. Keep in mind that my kid is 2 years old. She shouldn't have been walking around on her own. It scares me to think if she had gotten past the main doors or into the kitchen. \n\nOverall, it could have been a better visit. I would think twice before coming again. Sad because it would have been nice to start a new tradition.", 1], ["We had 2 pretty major incidents that affected our dining experience that will more-than-likely deter us from returning again. Very long review coming up....\n\nI first heard about Ricarda's Sunday Brunch through a friend who had dined there a few months back. She raved about the selection of food items and the Kid Zone, so I decided to take her there for her birthday celebration. We have 2 toddlers and 1 infant and were hoping we would get a nice adult-brunch with our husbands while our kids played. I read some reviews and saw mostly positive ones so I was excited! The morning started off relatively well. I had made the reservations for 10:45am and my friend arrived 15 minutes early. There was a hiccup with the name (maiden name VS married name) but it was resolved quickly. My husband arrived with our infant daughter and was brought to the table and offered help if he needed (service was going great!), I trailed behind with our 2-year-old son and saw that we were seated at the beautiful booth...awesome!\n\nFirst moment of eyebrows raising....daddies were going to grab food with the toddlers while mommies stayed back and set up the highchair for the baby. While we were scooting out of our booth my son wasn't paying attention and abruptly stood in front of our server. I apologized and he gave my son a bit of a dirty look (when you're a parent you are totally sensitive to these looks) but I brushed it off. He came to ask if we wanted some coffee and all was going well. Our whole party eventually did a walk-around and excitedly had our first plates of food.....and our kids decided they wanted to go play instead of eat (of course). \n\nThe Kid Zone was great! They had a kitchen, a round table with chairs for kids to eat, a bouncy castle, a nice rug with wooden train tracks (where my son stayed for most of his time there), and a lovely attendant chatting and engaging with the kids. Their food spread consisted of water, veggie sticks, chicken fingers/nuggets and cookies. My friend's daughter needed some coaxing and hand-holding to warm-up but once she did we were ecstatic! Finally some kid-free time! \n\nWe all were enjoying our brunch for about 2 minutes when, all of a sudden, my friend's daughter came running to our table ALONE carrying her shoes. No attendant with her, no server with her. ALONE. A 2-year old managed to escape the Kid-Zone and run away. Thank goodness she knew how to find us! What if she had gone to another table? Or, what if she had left the restaurant altogether? What if someone had taken her? So many horrible possibilities and outcomes. We were just thankful that she came to our table and commented that the attendant must be so overwhelmed. \n\nAt 11:45am our server, Ari, came to our table with the bill telling us \"in light of the 2-hour seating limit, here is your bill\". We said thank you, a little confused since we had only been here for 1 hour. We assumed that they just handed them out earlier so that it would be on their guests' radar. We commented within ourselves that it was a little odd, and were wondering if we made a mistake about our reservation time but we continued eating. I had just gotten my baby to sleep in my arms so I was a little upset because I hadn't even had time to really eat yet and felt rushed. At 12pm our server came back with the credit card machine asking how we would like to pay. My friend's husband said \"I thought we had 2 hours? We technically still have 45 minutes since our reservation was for 10:45am?\" The appropriate and professional response would be to have said \"Oh my apologies, there must be some miscommunication. Let me check on that\". Instead our server said \"Oh, ok, whatever\". Slapped the bill back onto our table, shrugged and stormed away, sulking. Then I watched him walk to the hostess stand and complain or sulk some more, while glaring at our table. This was the final straw. \n\nStill holding my daughter, I walked to the hostess stand and asked for the manager because all of these \"little\" incidents added up to a horrible experience. First of all, you are clearly targeting parents and families with your Kid Zone and kid-friendly foods, maybe you should find a server who actually likes kids. Second, I signed a waiver releasing Ricarda's of all responsibility in case my kids were injured but I'm pretty sure it doesn't include the negligence of letting one of them escape (A TWO YEAR OLD). Third, would it not have made sense to check with the hostess at the beginning of your shift to see what time our reservation was at? We sat down at 10:45am! Both the hostess and manager confirmed that they normally hand tables their bills 15 minutes before the 2 hour time limit is up so guests have the time to settle up and get ready to leave. The manager was very apologetic and told us he would ask another server to take care of us for the remainder of our meal and would add another 15 minutes to our seating time. That's it. Needless to say, we likely will not be returning.", 2], ["This is an updated review for a recent dinner experience. I stopped by Ricarda for a weeknight dinner with my family, and we shared a dinner for 2 for $80 (you get to share a starter, a pasta, a main, and a dessert) and ordered a flatbread on the side as well. This time around, I was not blown away by the food. Everything, from the risotto to the tiramisu dessert, was rather mediocre. Also for the amount of food we got, I thought everything was quite pricey. The best value item we got was probably the flatbread, which I unfortunately did not enjoy due to the type of cheese that they used. I was a little disappointed with my dinner, but I still want to come back and try their Sunday buffet brunch one day.", 3], ["I'm so impressed by Ricarda's refined atmosphere, beautiful Mediterranean seafood dishes, and wine selection ! \n\nFor light bites or starters, I highly recommend their CHARGRILLED OCTOPUS and FLATBREADS. The octopus was cooked so tender and dressed with a delicious sauce and small salad. The flatbreads had a good amount of fresh ingredients and the bread was thin but still soft.\n\nThe main entree I got was the LOBSTER RAVIOLI which was just as tasty as it was aesthetic. The black & white striped ravioli pasta was executed perfectly and had just the right amount of ricotta cheese inside. It was topped off with a savoury sauce and chunks of lobster. \n\nDefinitely put Ricarda's on the map for a posh atmosphere that you can enjoy perfectly done Mediterranean-style seafood, without the super high-end price. It is also VERY spacious & can accommodate for a large party size/company function !", 4], ["Wow. Where do I start about Ricarda's. What an awesome experience. Everything from the appetizers to dessert was amazing. First, the building is literally in another building.

Suits was filmed here and they even host weddings here! They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They even have a legit cafe/bakery inside.\n\nOnto the food. Wow the food. Appetizers such as bacon shrimp and charcuterie was a good intro to what the meal was going to be all about. If there's one thing they do exceptionally well, it is the seafood. The char-grilled octopus was extremely tender and that celery puree? Forget about describing it. Just go and try! \n\nBlack-striped lobster ravioli was on point. Grounded black pepper and salt carefully placed along the rim of the plate gave the dish that pop that enhanced the flavour of the fish. \n\nThe cote de boeuf was expertly cooked to medium rare and the grilled fish parrillada was a beautiful mix of seafood including scallops, shrimp, fish and octopus. Hungry yet? I'm salivating thinking about it and I just ate it. \n\nFor dessert I had the brown sugar pineapple cake and there were different sauces on every side of the plate. The cake itself isn't too sweet but the flavour of the sides made it. Caramel, yogurt lime, coconut dacquiose, wow.\n\nThe service was amazing. The servers and hosts were attentive and warm. They took care of every detail that I hardly knew what was going on (but that may have been the wine haha) and my glass was filled and utensils and plates cleared.

It also helped that they were celebrating their anniversary and giving out a free glass of prosecco to each person!  We started off with some great bread with a tomato olive spread. Just from the bread alone, you could tell they know what they are doing in the kitchen!!  I had the dinner special, which as a Cornish hen with gnocci and vegetables.

I'm always appreciative of someone that knows the menu from personal experience - not just whatever \"is popular\" or \"on special\".\n\nWe put in our order, emphasized how short on time we were, and then were served bread with a roasted red pepper and sour cream spread. The spread was very flavourful and complemented the bread very well - an interesting alternative to butter!\n\nFor mains from what I recall, we got the scallops, the mushroom risotto, and rack of lamb. The scallops were few...and came with a few ravioli - the worst volume for money. It was very tasty was the comment though! The rack of lamb and risotto were very good, the risotto I was personally quite happy with as there was just the right amount of truffle to make it distinct and the risotto was cooked well.\n\nThere's much of the menu to explore so I think I'll be back! Despite the mishaps when serving (a dish flipped over!) the staff were attentive to fix the issue right away - which was only inconvenient because we were in a rush to the theatre.

I liked that they played up the look of the dish by plating it in bone marrow, but they also put roughly three tablespoons of sea salt on one end just for aesthetics apparently (kind of wasteful). Since we were eating at 8:30pm, it was pretty dark in the restaurant so I thought it was grated cheese of some sort...ended up eating a mouthful of salt. Totally unnecessary in my opinion.\n\nHad the octopus saffron risotto for my main (3.5/5). The whole dish was slightly overcooked but otherwise good. It had a fair amount of mussels and chorizo too. Plating could definitely use some work.\n\nOrdered the hazelnut goat cheese dacquoise with raspberries in port with thyme (3/5). It was okay, not amazing. There's something about the thyme flavour that just didn't mesh well. \n\nService was great. Even though the food came out pretty slowly, our server would swing by and give us an update occasionally. He also brought over some fries (they're really good!) on the house - probably because of the wait - so that was a nice touch.

Glossy marble tables, dark hardwood floors, sleek bar, modern pendant lighting, plus lots of natural lighting, etc. It's like we walked into an interior designer magazine.\n\nSince we were celebrating a bachelorette, obviously we had to start with some mimosas ;) Choose between orange, peach, or white grape - yum!

Beautiful decor too.  We will be back if we are in the area.", 4], ["Beautiful decor and very nice service. I just wish the portions were a little bigger! \n\nI came for Saturday brunch and tried the Lamb Confit with Hash, which was basically a thin stew with shreds of lamb (sort of like a pulled pork) over potatoes, with a poached egg and a side of salad. The flavour was nice and warming but there was barely any lamb and I ended the meal feeling like I could eat a whole other meal. That said, the eggs benny looked great and I wouldn't mind coming back to try the lunch or dinner menu!", 3], ["Came here a bunch of times as its so close to my office, got snacks and lunch a few times on a weekday and for their weekend brunch. There's usually a lot of tables available but its also not empty, ,but quiet enough to chat.  \n\nFirstly the space is beautiful, tiled floors high ceilings, green wall, plush velvet chairs! When you walk by you can watch and SMELL all the pastries being made in the morning, it really calls you in. \n\nFor the weekday lunch I got a risotto, but it actually came as pearl couscous like not actual risotto rice which was a little disappointing. The portion was a bit smaller for the price, but there was lots of mushroom and truffle taste, really savory and came out hot. But $20 for a weekday lunch is on the pricier side, but great for a business power lunch.\n\nOn the weekend, I came once with a large group. They take reservations for brunch so good for parties. They do walk around with a tray of pastries and offer one to you, they look tempting but do know they charge for it and its not free. Some people thought it was included, but its not. \n\nI got the duck confit hash, the raisins added a great sweetness, lots of texture happening with the crunchy almonds and the portion size was good. Eggs were runny and it came with a salad no complaints here. One of my friends got the steak and eggs and unfortunately the steak came really underdone, she sent it back and they made her a new one but it was still poorly cooked according to her. Everyone else in the party had no problems with their meals though. \n\nTheir stuffed croissants are delicious though, really buttery and flakey with lots of filling whichever flavor you get. Coffees and lattes are good, but not cheap. \n\nThey also do a lot of catering for my office building, great breakfast sandwiches with eggs and sausage. You can also rent the lobby of the building and I've seen them put together beautiful dinners and receptions as I walk by.", 3], ["Came here for an early Mother's Day lunch and was really impressed. The food is very reasonably priced, good sized portions and tastes delicious. For the starter I had the crab bisque which had chunks of real crab meat and for my main I ordered the seafood risotto which was creamy and had three huge shrimp! My dad got the lamb burger which was cooked to perfection and my mom ordered the lobster linguine which had lovely hand made noodles. For dessert we had the tiramisu which was wrapped in a perfect dark chocolate shell. \nThe interior of the restaurant is beautiful and spacious and the service was attentive.", 5], ["We came here for their sunday brunch, specifically fir the foie gras. Its not the best but its good and its ayce foie gras \u200d\u200d. They have a decent seafood selection including oysters, shrimp and squid. Their salads are good and their pastries are delicious. They have a breakfast station, an egg station, bread station eyc. Their selections are varied so you have a lot to choose from. You can also add bottonless mimosas to your sunday brunch for additional price, and you can get a variety of different mimosas made with different fruit juices too. They also have a live band on Sundays.", 4], ["Ricarda's is a great dinner option. Something in between fancy and casual. \n\nThe decor is lovely. They have a separate lounge area + just dinner table area.\nOn Sundays they have Jazz brunch - which is $55/person for a buffet and no a la carte option. So if you're aiming here for brunch and don't want to do the buffet, probably best to come on a Saturday instead. \n\nThe staff are all quiet on point. The food came out fairly quick as well. Lots of interesting plates to pick from!", 5], ["Had brunch at Ricarda's - we got the Shakshuka and the Lamb Confit - both of which were quite unpleasant (we've had way better shakshuka at many other Toronto places and also homemade). The service was subpar - we asked if the Shakshuka goat cheese could be replaced with another cheese and was told yes. The shakshuka came with one slice of pre-sliced pizza cheese partly-melted on top. The worst part was the service: the waiter had an attitude. Tons of other brunch places in Toronto - I'd stay away from this one!", 2], ["When I stepped into Ricarda's I immediately thought \"business lunch'. The television series \"Suits\" is usually filmed here which sorta makes it a cool place. The restaurant is so large and airy and spacious. For me it screams business lunch and why not since the entertainment district is a few blocks away. It's a little on the fancier end with a wide selection of wines and different menus for lunch and dinner. \n\nThe kitchen is quite visible to diners. We were served three selection of breads with a dried roasted tomato dip on the house. As I was walking out I later saw one of the cooks dipping it out from a packaged container with no label. Not sure what was happening with that. \n\nI ordered the lunch special for $16. It was worth the price. A baked flatbread laid out in on a wooden platter and cut into pizza-like slices. It was the right temperature when it was served to me. It was baked with oozy gooey cheeze, red peppers, tuna, shrimp-all drizzled on a pesto sauce. A fresh handful of baby arugula as garnish made this baby so delicious. Lunch was satisfying to say the least. The postcards served with the bill is a nice way to end time spent here. It is quite unique to this place. \n\nWhat I didn't like about dining here was the fact that the restaurant was empty yet our food took more than 45minutes to come out.", 4], ["This is for the overall Sunday jazz brunch experience. \nThe bouncing castle and the foie gras alone worth 5 stars. \nThe rest of the food is ok nothing too memorable and kind of mediocre. I will say 3 stars.\nBut worth going if you are eating out with kids! Super fun for kids and you know how relief you are when your kids are playing independently while you can actually enjoy what you are eating!

This is nice since it is a much more toned down relaxed environment than the beautifully designed upscale on the inside.\n\nMore sustainable methods should be considered since their bins are always overflowing and well, looks really bad with all the paper cups, plastic lids, stir sticks etc that are clearly going to the landfill.\n\nWould love to come for dinner but the menu and the price, to me doesn't seem worth it.  Just my two cents.", 3], ["I loved this place. I had the pork belly and octopus carbonara. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time.

Definitely recommend.", 5], ["Fabulous light breakfast with salmon, avocado, eggs and salad.

Came here with some girlfriends for summerlicious.\n\nWe got the truffle fries to start. I like that they use skinny fries. It smelled strongly of truffles, but we couldn't taste it, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nI ordered the pork terrine as my starter. It was a decent dish. Wish there was another piece of crostini, as there was lots of terrine left over that I ate on its own. \n\nHad the vegetable risotto as my main. Very lovely and creamy, slightly on the salty side. Could use a bit of pepper.\n\nWe ordered all three desserts between the three of us. Vanilla Cheesecake Lemon Crumble was rich and delicious. Served with baked strawberries and rhubarb, and a cucumber mint sauce. The strawberries and rhubarb paired well with the cheesecake. The acidity helped cut through the richness. Cucumber mint sauce tasted out of place. Not a fan of it. Coconut Lime Dacquoise was good. The dacquiose was light and tasted strongly of coconut and lime. Served with pineapple sauce and pomegranate seeds, giving the dessert a nice tropical feel. Final dessert was a mint chocolate tart served with mangoes. Mint chocolate is always a winning combo in my book. Mangoes were nice, but didn't go with the rest of the dessert in my opinion.\n\nWe were sat right next to the open kitchen which was very entertaining. The kitchen staff were super nice and very funny. Joked around with us a bit whenever they had a spare moment. Service was a little slow for my liking though.", 4], ["True example of how bad service can ruin your meal.\n\nOur waitress handed out select breads and baked goods in a basket and purposely did not mention that these were not complimentary. In my experience, at a nice restaurant, it is common that these kinds of add-ons come at no cost. When I mentioned politely to the waitress that this really wasn't clear, she looked at me as if I was the dumbest person in the world and said, \"Of course they aren't free.\" No apology. She was abrasive throughout the meal, so this was the cherry on top of a very mediocre cake. \n\nFood was passable, depending on what you ordered. Note that the shakshuka does not come in a skillet and the smoothie bowl is more like a smoothie cup.

(Not sure why they preferred that we come anyearlier). Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We weren't originally going to order alcohol but another staff member came by asking if we needed help ordering a drink (she made the drinks list), and was offered to sample some wine, and even added some sweetener to my rose (I like my wine very sweet). \n\nOur mains came before our appetizer which wasn't a big deal but there was a mix up in the kitchen. \n\n\nWe ordered:\n\nFritto Misto $18 (were told it's a blend of lightly fried seafood and some vegetables). It was a small bowl of tempura tasting vegetables (we had this in Italy before and the batter tasted completely different). And there was only one large shrimp in the small dish which was very disappointing.\n\nHoney Braised Lamb Shank $29 came with pomegranate rice and tabbouleh. The sides weren't very special and we actually didn't like the taste of the rice and tabbouleh was very dry. The lamb itself was fairly big and filling.\n\nLemon Saffron Linguine $20. Came with hand-made pasta, mushrooms, calamaretti, and some vegetables. Again, was a little dry for my liking.\n\nLastly we asked about the dessert sampling platter at the start of the meal which included a little bit of each of the desserts on the menu. When we were ready to order, the manager came over to tell us due to the pricing of the ingredients the dish now costs $27, not the $15 that is listed...\nSo we deliberated and decided that we still wanted to try all the deserts this place is known for, our waitress let us know the dish actually costs $25, not $27. (I don't know if they just decided this as we were ordering because it seemed pretty odd the prices kept changing and after we ordered, most of the tables ordered the same thing). \n\nDessert Platter: selection of 4 out of 6 desserts listed and I have to say, none of them really stood out as a favourite. All were presented very elegantly but the taste was a bit bland.\n\nOverall the ambience/space and service was very classy and friendly, but I think I would only come back here for drinks and not the food.", 3], ["Summary: a fancy, classy place with pretty good food\nPrice: $40 / person\nFood: 4/5\nEnvironment: 4/5\nService: 4/5\n\nWe went to here for team lunch.

However, it also got a 3-course-prefix menu which is about $35 / person.\n\nI really like this place because the service is good, food is good, environment is good, just a bit expensive.\n\nI choose the tuna salad starter. Surprisingly, it got big chunks of tuna, the tuna is pretty fresh and tasty.\nI was deciding between mushroom linguine and lamb burger for main course. Some of teammates choose lamb burger, the portion was really good and I heard it was very juicy. I chose mushroom linguine.

My sister thought her pasta was a bit too Al dente and told our server, he offered to remake it without any questions asked and actually came back to tell us the chief agreed it was a bit on the Al dente side. I have never encounter a chief that owns up to their mistake!  I thought that was quite honourable. \n\nAs for value, the DIY pasta cost $17 while most of the main entree hover around $20-$25 with very Generous portions. \n\nThe restaurant looked very sophisticated and chic with very inviting spaces like their lounge area and booths. \n\nLast but not least, the service!! It was top notch.  Our main server Britney was super friendly and was also supported by a team of other servers that genuinely looked like they care about you.  We bought a cake for my sister's bday, not only they plate it for us, they even decorated with fresh fruits!

You can definitely get a great meal here at a reasonable price.\n\nMe and my friend ordered:\n- Bouillabaisse ($26): This is a different type of bouillabaisse where the soup is separated from the seafood. I got a good sized portion of fish, mussles, clams, prawn and scallop. The soup itself was very delicious (intense lobster bisque flavour, not overly salty). The crostinis provided were a perfect complement to the soup. Yum!\n\n- Honey braised lamb shank ($28): Also a very good dish. Lamb shank was braised well (tender) and was very flavourful. A good portion of tabbouleh and jeweled pomergranate rice were given as sides and they were both very delicious. \n\nI have heard mixed things about their seafood brunch but given my experience here for dinner, I am definitely looking to come back again and would be more than willing to try their brunch at some point.\n\nDefinitely recommended!", 4], ["Came to Ricarda's for brunch a few months back.

It's accessible through the path and there are stairs leading up to a bar and patio though I'm not sure if that's just a bar or if you can eat there.

The booth is really comfy though, so comfy that I wanted to take it home. \n\nBetween two people, we got the pea soup, tuna tartare, beef brisket, sea bream, chocolate profiterole and coconut rice pudding. We basically split everything. Honestly, I just expected Bymark to be like Canoe, overhyped with okay food but most of the dishes was executed very well. Pea soup was solid and it was cute that it came in a pot and was then poured into my bowl at the table. Tuna tartare was good but most tuna tartares I've had are. Originally, I wanted the brisket but I didn't want us to have the same mains so I went with sea bream instead. Hot deal. Not saying the brisket wasn't good (because it was) but I just prefer the fish dish. Fish was juicy, flavours were good, and I liked the Israeli couscous much more than regular couscous. Most disappointing part of the meal was the dessert the rice was very hard in the coconut rice pudding. The chocolate profiterole was delicious though. Not a huge chocolate fan so I'm always afraid chocolate desserts will be too much and really sweet but it was neither. My favourite part wasn't a chocolate component though, it was the honeycombs.\n\nService was really good. Our server was hilarious and attentive.

I enjoyed dinner with my family there. The coat check lady is nice, she gave us warmest welcome! They have fantastic food and customer service! The staff there is patient, and they really concern about you! Will come back again", 5], ["Located underground in the heart of downtown Toronto, this place was certainly a hidden surprise. (Not sure if they still do it now, but you get a voucher or something for parking since parking downtown is quite pricey). \n\nI would definitely come here for their lobster poutine again; it was a rare dish in Toronto and oh so good! A lobster tail is wrapped among a small dome of crisp fries, sauces and cheese... drool. The wild mushrooms in a mini pot dish was also very cute; a good portion for a single person only though. Their steak on the other hand was a bit boring, and dry. Presented lonesomely on a white plate with a single rosemary on top, it almost looked like they were out of garnishes.\n\nTheir wine list was quite extensive, which added to the lovely d\u00e9cor of the restaurant.. Wine lovers do give this place a try. If you want a date at a restaurant that offers good food and wine, and a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, add this place to your list. \n\nDefinitely coming here again for their lobster poutine and their wine collection.", 4], ["I went to Bymark for last year's Summerlicious, but that didn't deter me from coming back again. Why? Because I immediately noticed that the famous Bymark burger was on their Winterlicious lunch menu! There was a lot of hype around this gourmet burger, priced at a whopping $35 on their regular lunch menu! Personally, I would never pay $35 for a burger, but I didn't mind trying it for $25 when the deal included an appetizer and dessert! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a fancy version of a caesar salad- Romaine hearts with honey smoked bacon, oven cured tomatoes, reggiano, and caesar vinaigrette. It was lighter than the usual caesar salad and wasn't heavily dressed. \n\nAll the girls, myself included, opted for crispy crab cakes with celery root & apple remoulade. The crab cake was pretty tasty. I would've liked more of that remoulade, for that artistic smear was not nearly enough for two crab cakes. I did, however, very much enjoyed that refreshing vegetable slaw. It had a great crunch and paired well with the fried crab cake. \n\nMost of us ordered the famous Bymark 8 oz U.S.D.A. Prime Burger with brie de meaux and grilled king mushroom! It was definitely a sizable burger! I was so excited to cut my burger open and see that it came out perfectly rare! The quality of the beef was excellent, and the juicy patty was definitely the star of the burger. In contrast, the toppings were rather lackluster. The cheese and mushroom were nice, but they weren't enough to elevate the burger. Some people might prefer the simplicity to let the beef patty shine, but I was really craving for some sort of sweetness. Perhaps adding caramelized onions would've helped. Overall, I enjoyed this gourmet burger, but I would still never pay $35 for it. I think that there are affordable burgers out there that are comparable to the quality of this one. \n\nOne of my friends ordered the pasta instead- pappardelle and braised rabbit with winter vegetables, tossed in a grainy mustard sauce. I took a few bites from her pasta and I thought that the mustard sauce was delicious. The sweetness of the sauce certainly worked well with the rabbit and the pappardelle. As well, the rabbit was quite tender. This dish would've been a great alternative had I not set my eyes on the burger. \n\nFor dessert, my friends ordered the apple crostata with caramel crunch ice cream. The crostata was like a free-form apple pie, so naturally, it was an immediate hit. The general complaint was that the pastry on the outside was overly dry and thick, but other than that, we all enjoyed the dessert.\n\nMy boyfriend opted for an orange Nanaimo brownie with toasted meringue. The two bites that I stole were really, really good! Normally, I don't like pairing citrus with chocolate (I hate chocolate oranges), but here, the two components worked strangely well together. I would order this brownie again for myself if I see it on their menu in the future.\n\nI picked the homiest dessert of all- gingerbread cake with sweet potato mousse and maple walnut fudge. Gingerbread, sweet potato, maple, and walnut are all favours that I adore, so it was an obvious choice for me. The cake was very moist and tasted delicious with the creamy mousse, but I couldn't really taste the sweet potato in the mousse. The cubes of maple walnut fudge were adorable, and their tiny size was perfect for such a rich concoction. Overall, I enjoyed my dessert, but I wish all the flavours were more intense- especially the gingerbread and sweet potato mousse.  \n\nOn the whole, I enjoyed my lunch at Bymark more than my first experience. The burger was good, though perhaps not the best burger I've ever had. Nevertheless, it was definitely a good deal for Winterlicious.", 4], ["Great decor, decent food, but inattentive service that left us frustrated. I asked the waitress to put down that I had an allergy to parsley and cilantro (I have a strong aversion to those two herbs) but when my main course came, I found both in my food. The wait between courses was long, and the wait for any acknowledgement of us wanting to pay our bills with the machine was even longer. \n\nFor $48 (Summerlicious 2016 menu), I will not even be coming back for prix fixe, let alone normally. Service should be much better at such a restaurant.", 2], ["Best food and service I have had in my life, or for as long as I can remember right now lol. \nThe server was amazing, he left us alone when he should have and came to the table seemingly just when he was needed. \n\nThe lobster poutine might be the best thing I have ever tasted, at first I couldn't believe the price of it.. but then I tasted it and I understood. I could eat that every day of my life and be happy.\n\nI had the lamb loin for dinner and the portion was very big, which is very uncommon for higher end restaurants. You know how it usually goes, you pay tons of money for two bites of food that look pretty on a plate. This definitely was not the case at Bymark. I wasn't sure how I was going to finish it but it was so yummy that I had to do it somehow. \n\nMy boyfriend had the burger and said it was delicious, the best burger he has ever eaten.\n\nThe Oysters were very fresh and also great! \n\nWe didn't have desert because we were way too full, next time!", 5], ["Maybe this place was great back in the day. I've heard some friends talk about it and say it is hard to get a table for summer/winterlicious. \n\nPros: Intimate setting and decor. Acoustics are comfortable and the place was not loud. Good service, friendly. I liked the lemon icecream dessert mixed with basil and tasted my friend's short cake mixed with a herb and my other friend's chocolate tart - good. \n\nCons: The meal itself. I found the shaved asparagus salad to be quite bitter, it had a mix of flavors but nothing fully satisfying. The Cod main meal - my friend had the same meal and she was also not pleased. She finished it though so that says something. I did not - that says something also. I found there to be too much polenta (too much of something is a bad thing?- well when it doesnt taste like much and feels more to be as filler than adding flavor - or maybe it was to offset the fish) The fish was pretty darned salty. I should have said something but it was as the border of too salty and salty. I was hoping it would improve as I got through it. Nope. Then it was mixed with the bitter greens. For me, this was such a disappointment since I had the salad and was not impressed but to have the main be bad too? I sat there thinking, if this were not summerlicious my dish would be so pricey. How awful to have the taste sub par but also the price putting a really useless dent in my wallet. \n\nI was told lately and have heard before that places are tending to give their sub par dishes for summerlicious because they are getting a lower price for it all. I do not think that this is what Bymark did, but I am left puzzled as to my friend's reviews of it all. \n\nWhen your meal is putting a dent in your wallet and/or a halt on your fitness regime - it had better be well worth it! Well at Least I tried this place.", 2], ["My boyfriend took me to bymark for my birthday, I had been hearing good things and so had been looking forward to a Mark McEwan staple.  I had tried North 44 with a groupon a few years ago, the octopus was delicious but everything else was good, but not spectacular. \n\nOn this experience, we sat on the patio on a warm June evening, in the financial district, surrounded by suits and reality show looking wives. We mulled over the menu, and decided, for appetizers, would order the Lobster Poutine with b\u00e9arnaise sauce, and the shaved foie gras on brioche.  For dinner, my BF ordered the ricotta ravioli and I ordered the duck with potato Mille feuille. \n\nThe Butter Braised Lobster Poutine - at $28 was delicious, as it should be in theory, cus how can you go wrong with buttery lobster over fried frites, smothered with a classic buttery sauce. The lobster was tender and portions of the crustacean was pretty adequate.  \n\nThe Shaved Foie Gras Torchon - at $28, to us, was a disappointment. We prefer our foie seared, the bouncy flavorful morsel melting in my mouth. But, we can't say no to foie, so we ordered it, not really know what to expect. I'm not sure how much foie you actual get at its a light, airy mound, it was tasty, but I'm not sure if I actually consumed it, or perhaps the wind just blew it away. \n\nMy boyfriend, who hates mushrooms, ordered the:\nTruffle and spinach ricotta tortellini with tomato sauce and more mushrooms at $29. He's Italian and he loves ravioli, and by the time I looked up he was done his entire bowl, so I'm sure he liked them.\n\nAnd I had the:\nLightly smoked Duck Breast on top a butter potato Mille feuille, and turnips, carrots, fava beans. The duck was cooked perfectly, everything was flavorful and delicious. \n\nOverall, I had a good experience.  The food was good, there's nothing bad I can say about it. Was it mind blowing and inventive, no, not really, but it was a good. It's reliable and well executed.  Maybe when you already have a name established you can just coast on the fame, and be safe, but reliable.  I would ideally rate it 3.75 stars, because as it was very good, the price point is high, I feel I have better and/or comparable meals in Montreal and New York for less. But still, a nice experience!", 4], ["I came here for a friend's birthday. Nothing on the Summerlicious Menu appealed to me, so I order a few appetizers (Caesar salad & grilled octopus and calamari). \n\nI didn't like the service at all. The server seemed annoyed with us.", 3], ["Visited Bymark for Summerlicious dinner. It was good but not amazing.  The ambiance is nice and service is adequate. The lighting is a bit too dark for me but this is just personal. \n\nThe dishes are generally good and I did enjoyed the food but they are not memorable.  The following were ordered for our party:\n- Heirloom Carrot & Avocado Salad \n- Calamari & Chorizo Sausage\n- Pan Seared Halibut\n- Pasta & Braised Short Rib Cacciatore\n- Baked Alaska\n\nMay be the food are better from non-Summerlicous menu, but this probably would not be my first choice restaurant when spending at this price range.", 3], ["Despite one of our guests arriving 30 minutes later than the reservation time (he got lost), we were still treated very well by the servers. I never got the hint that we were being treated worse because we were Summerlicious participants as I have heard this sometimes happens with other restaurants. The food came in a timely manner, was well-portioned, and was delicious throughout. There were unique items picked for the Summerlicious menu and they were all fantastic. I especially loved the steak option in the entree though I didn't order it myself. It was extremely succulent and it was quite a sufficient portion size, which is something you sometimes worry about with these higher end restaurants. If I had the option to sit on the patio outside, I would have loved to. It is absolutely gorgeous and right in the middle of the TD towers. The interior was still beautiful though so I did not mind at all. Overall, a fantastic experience and a great introduction to a lovely restaurant.", 5], ["The seared tuna sashimi was delish! Def worth a try. But the real winner here is the lobster poutine. It's phenomenal but very heavy. Thankfully, they have a half portion available.", 4], ["Came for lunch and chose the seared tuna sashimi and the tuna and bacon sandwich, paired with the Bynark Sauv Blanc.\n\nService was impeccable, friendly without being too familiar. Bread came right away and refreshingly only one piece offered, and he was never seen again. At first I was left wanting more but I was glad in the end, as there was a delicious lunch ahead.\n\nThe tuna was perfectly seared, my only snipe is that the portions were not evenly sliced.  The seasoned peanuts were very tasty, if somewhat difficult to pick up with a fork.\n\nThe sandwich came came with sweet potato fries that were not over salted. The tuna appeared to be the same as for the appy just cut thicker, and the sandwich was awesome - I especially liked the bread.\n\nI even had room for dessert and selected the chef's choice trio; all were delicious! \n\nWell worth the money in my view. This should be a Michelin starred restaurant.", 5], ["I had lunch here with 4 of my co-workers. We were seated promptly. The service was quick despite how busy it was.  We came for the Winterlicious menu.\n\nFor starters I had the Celery root puree with chicken confit, crisp skin, salted pistachio brittle & sage. This was the best course hands down. I was afraid when they submerged the crispy skin into the puree that it would get soggy. But surprisingly that wasn't the case. Even the sage was crispy. I enjoyed every component of this dish.\n\nFor the main I tried the Organic Trout with crispy artichokes, arugula, caramelized cipollinis & dill buttermilk dressing.  The fish was perfectly cooked. My only let down was the skin not being crispy. That maybe a matter of personal taste. I really liked the crispy artichokes. Also I felt like it wasn't a cohesive dish. It was missing something that could bring it all together. \n\nFor dessert I had the Honey Bourbon Sage Cr\u00e8me Brulee and whipped shortbread cookies. The shortbread cookie sat on top of some sort of berry jam. That jam was easily the best thing on the plate. I didn't get much of a bourbon flavor which I was looking for. I was disappointed that it was falsely advertised but it was damn good Cr\u00e8me brulee. \n\nI had high expectations going in and for the most part my expectations were met. My friends were also impressed with the service and food. I would definitely recommend bymark.", 4], ["Dined here on a Friday for lunch and was extremely disappointed in the service.

Aside from that They have a grocery section, and I am going to try and keep them in mind next time I want high quality European style groceries. In short you can get cheese and deli meat to serve your family as a snack, the goods to help make an excellent dinner and oh yes their delicious deserts, all in one shopping session, and come Christmas time they have gift baskets.

I tried a few and they were all consistently good: creamy filling was smooth and not overly sweet, tube was perfectly fried so it was firm (not hard) and tasty (not overcooked). So whatever flavour you get, you're sure to enjoy. \n\nYou can see I'm a big fan of the cannolis, but also really enjoyed their gelato. I got a medium cup (2 scoops/flavours), and chose sweet cream and peach gelato. Both were summer in a cup: so good!\n\nSo after all this raving, why only 4 stars? I was a bit disappointed with their other pastries. The bombolone was just ok, and the diplomatico slice was a bit dry.\n\nThat said, Tre Mari is a winner overall, and a definite must-try. I will be back!", 4], ["Probably the friendliest service I've ever had at a bakery / cafe .. I normally go to Caldense because it's close to my house.

Please note that weekends and in particular Sundays, are busy Italian bakery days. So, my question is how in the world is only having one cashier, one person at the pastry booth, 5 people behind the bar chatting and giggling excusable? Those lines here are brutal and not to mention, people simply toss manners and decorum out the window to get theri hands on whatever dessert they want (usually not even the traditional Italian desserts funny enough).\n\nThe food...It is overpriced, not gonna lie. Is it the best quality? No. Are the products hard to find? In Corso Italia? No but elsewhere in the city? Probably if Little Italy is excluded. Foods to avoid: the bread (it will harden in a day), soft cheeses (the thickness of the film gives it a spooky feel), the coffee (I would skip it), and the cold cuts probably to avoid the cost for something unlikely to be of the freshest quality. Foods to get: A Zeppole (although it will be moister than others), the Tiramisu could be worse but most definitely could be better, and chocolates or pre-packed goods that are from Italia.\n\nThe service...For the 70 dollars I spent on a birthday cake, I would have hoped for at the bare minimum a closed box. I understand that no one wants things squished and smashed. However, why not place the cake in a bigger box? I asked for a bag since it took me well over an hour to reach my designation of this bakery...Denied. When I asked for a bag, just give me a big bag. I saw people with small items leave with huge bags given to them by the cashier. I informed the cashier that I was traveling all the way down to the waterfront/lakeshore. I got two random answers that equated to too bad, so sad, good luck. So a 70 dollar cake PLUS the 21 dollar Uber down to my place because I guess hindsight is 20/20 and I should've brought my own bag. \n\nNot.\n\nWorth.\n\nIt. \n\nNext time, I will just go to a nearby place and get some cupcakes or something. If you were like me looking for a cannoli cake, there are other bakeries in the city that make them. At the length of time and aggravation this trek costed me, I will simply go to Vaughan next time for something akin to what I ordered.", 2], ["I had only a sfogliatelle, and it was very good. The place was quite crowded on a Saturday morning, as it seems to be more than \"just\" a bakery. It's not as quaint as some smaller bakeries---it has a deli section, a hot bar, a separate counter register, but they do seem to make the breads fresh (even if they're a bit squishy). As for the sfogliatelle from the pastry counter, it was fresh enough to be crunchy, and the filling wasn't too sweet or creamy. Not mind-blowingly good, but perfectly respectable and up to standard.", 4], ["Whenever I'm near little Italy I definitely stop by here to pick up cannolis and some other yummy sweets.\n\nIf you're near by during lunch or dinner be prepared for a line up.  But it does move pretty fast.  The porketta is super tender and a must-try.  If meat is not your thing then go for any of the pastas.  Even the rice is delicious.\n\nThey do not skimp on portions either so be prepared for leftovers or a stuffed belly.  \n\nOverall this place is priced well for very good food. The only downfall is that they don't have a lot of seating so its hard to eat in.", 4], ["Came here late in the day so there wasn't much left. This is very much the old school bakery and delicatessen. There was limited seating on my visit due to ongoing renovation.

Just based on the pictures, I thought Tre  Mari was a small mom and pop shop. Boy I was wrong! I visited Sunday afternoon and it was packed! There was so much stuff there!

I would give an overall 4 star if the service improves.\n\nA clearly beloved Italian neighbourhood bakery that has its regulars come in to enjoy an espresso and cannoli.  I was finally in the area to check it out and try the famed cannoli myself.  This bakery is far bigger than I expected with a full service hot plate area with everything from veal sandwiches to dinners, large seating area, gelato, a large deli counter, espresso drinks, and all the sweet baked Italian goods.\n\nWe came after dinner and was hoping for a light sweet bite to close out the night.  The bakery allows a lot of light and there are many tables available to sit down.  Most of the tables were clean.  One clear misstep was the service... there was maybe only 1 person every 5 or 10 minutes trying to order something from the various sections.  I spotted at least 1 to 2 employees at each counter.  All counters except the actual cashier area was very slow.  I stood in front of the cakes while a young lady stood in the middle of the gelato, cookies, and cakes hunched over reading something.  I was like for around 5 minutes before the cashier finished cashing out someone and yelled out her name to make her be aware I was waiting.  I saw this a few times.  Off day with service perhaps?\n\nCannoli (vanilla and chocolate chip ricotta) - I say these prefilled and was worried as it was 8 pm and I know that a pre-filled cannoli is not usually a good sign.  We still ordered 2 mini cannolis... one a simple vanilla and the other chocolate chip ricotta.  I took a bite of the chocolate chip one and was pleasantly surprised how the pastry still had a nice crunch to it.  It wasn't soggy.  The sweetness was good and not overwhelming.  It could have a bit more flavour (I usually love a bit of candied citrus to offer something more than just sugar).  The vanilla one wasn't as good since the shell was definitely more soggy... it wasn't crispy and absorbed some of the filling already.  The filling had a tiny hint of vanilla and lightly sweet.  Not bad but the shell was a disappointment.   4/5 for chocolate chip and 3.5/5 vanilla\n\nAmaretti (almond and maraschino topped) - They have an entire section just dedicated to amaretti and wow, these were just great.  Full almond flavour that is not too sweet but very good.  The texture was pleasantly chewy and for the ones that had a dusting of powdered sugar had a light thin crispy sugary shell... the maraschino cherry ones were the best as it gave a great cherry flavour (dont get the candied ones!) 5/5\n\nSfogliatelle - These were gorgeous... flakey layers all nicely seperated with a nice bronze colour.  These were really well made.  When I took a bite, the layers all shattered and was nice to keep that crunch even it was baked hours ago.  What was unfortunate was the filling... even after 3 large bites to try to get to the filling, I kept finding air pockets.  There was very little filling and what was there sank all to the back.  It had a bit of vanilla but not much.  3.5/5\n\nButter cookies (blueberry and raspberry -  These were really confusing as they were called butter cookies but after taking a bite, there was no taste of butter and incredibly soggy.  It did come from a case that had a lot of humidity in it as the case was filled with water drops on the glass.  These were more expensive than the cannoli so I was expecting something more but with it having no flavour and lacklustre texture, this was disappointing.  I will admit that it looked very good.  3/5\n\nI wish I could give this place a 4 star because they do have some great items... just the service seemed really inattentive and bored.", 3], ["Well, finally last Friday, I got to give this place a try since people have given it many favorable reviews, and I really wanted to check it out.\n\nI'm just going to speak for the food. My sole purpose of coming here was to continue my quest for finding some of the best cannolis in the city. Did I find them here? Not yet. I had a pistachio filled one and a chocolate filled one. Sure they tasted good, but did they make me go \"whoa, right on!\"? Nope. But I do want to try the other pastries like the babas which some of my friends have spoken highly of. \nI'm definitely sure this is also the place that features that Gelatio in a Brioche bun.\nAlso I've recently developed a craving for arancini and decided to try one here. I don't even remember what was in the middle of it but the little rice ball wasn't warm, and the tomato sauce as well, just didn't do to compliment the flavor of it.\n\nMaybe I didn't go at a good time.  \nI might just have to venture there again and take a box of pastries home for a quiet movie night, or to have something sweet to start off the morning.\nMaybe that will help develop a better taste and appreciation for what's offered at Tre Mari.", 3], ["Not a lot of varieties to choose from in general. \nNot impressed by their hot table.

They make me want to hug them. \n\nThey have some very good breads and love the deli counter.", 5], ["Very similar to San Remo (on the West-end), Lazar (in Mississauga), Monastery (Oakville) or any large, Italian bakery for that matter.  \n\nTre Mari seems to be an institution on St. Clair W., and it has a section where bread is displayed, a counter for deli meats & cheese, 2-3 sections with various pastries and baked goods, a gelato section, a hot table, and a coffee bar.  This place is pretty big!\n\nChoose what you want at the various counter(s), you may have to take a number for the pastries, then cash out in the front.  The experience can be a bit intimidating, especially when it's busy, and it was on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nI had a Nata tart - pretty good, not sickeningly sweet - and a pistachio cannoli which was really good, pastry was actually crispy which is rare.  Well, at least I haven't had one with a crispy pastry in a while.\n\nTons of people seated inside/out, eating gelato, a veal sandwich, sipping an espresso.  So they can't be all wrong, right?  Staff was pretty friendly.  No attitude here.  Interior can use some updating.", 4], ["I come here all the time and its an amazing place to get a snack or fresh coffee. This is a place where you can also get amazing choices of Charcuteries and cheeses and Fresh baked breads and pastries!! I always get the pistachio flavored cannoli and also the sorbets are worth trying. It could've been nice if they have a patio but other than that, they're a very good place to relax on the weekend with family and friends. Will also recommend it for cooked foods on their buffet line if you're in a rush.", 4], ["Not sure how anyone can think this is quality.  The deserts have artificial ingredients and taste awful.  The cannoli are among the worst I have tried in Toronto.  Fried shell where you can taste the oil and artificial flavours. Go downtown for quality Italian pastries.", 1], ["The cannoli is so amazing. The pistachio ones especially.   Pizza is also very good and so is the espresso. I can't  praise them enough.  The staff were so pleasant.  Go there.", 5], ["Love their pastries, awesome veal sandwich, busy but worth the waiting.", 5], ["The aroma of fresh baked bread, the display cases full of cookies, cakes and pastries that are as appealing to the eye as you know they will be to the stomach and a smiling staff behind the counters let me know this was a place I would love at first glance.\n\nBakeries work long hard hours to produce quality products...and having a staff that adds customer service on top of that is my kind of business to shop.  Staying on St. Clair with a very good friend for a couple of days she let me know that we HAD to get cookies.   Purchase cookies wedid, a few times...and even just before I hopped into a cab to head back to the States!\n\nI loved the sweet, chewy and crunchy crust of the almond cookies the best....and wish I had some right now!  The wire shelves holding an assortment of fresh baked baguettes, rolls and other artisan offerings was amazing.  Having been in this business myself a few years back, I appreciated the simplicity of their presence in the neighborhood, no frills, no neon....just good food served by good people.\n\nI wish I had time to sample the pizza and other hot dishes I saw being readied for the lunch crowd....but that will be another culinary adventure when I return.....and I can't wait!", 4], ["You guys...this place SMELLS AMAZING. Like my Italian grandmother's house. I walked in and it was the first thing I noticed: before the pastries, hot food, or anything else. \n\nThe pastries were similar to what I have when I visit my grandmother's little town in Italy, and just as amazing. Everything is really fresh. There's a small grocery selection as well in case you need some imported Italian pantry supplies.\n\nOn the hot food front, holy crap. So tasty. I got a meatball sub and for $6 got something that tasted perhaps better* than the meatballs my grandmother used to make, on really fresh, soft bread.\n\nPlus, for baking nerds like me, they sell fresh yeast!!\n\n*please don't tell her I said that.", 4], ["Whenever I meet someone from out of town, and they ask me to describe Toronto, I tell him or her that Toronto is a city of neighbourhoods. \n\nI know that people often point to our \"rich cultural diversity\" or our \"commitment to multiculturalism\" but respectfully, I think that those labels miss the point. Diversity and multiculturalism are wonkish words; they describe the place, but not the people; and the true character of a city lies in its citizens. \n\nThis is why I love Tre Mari. \n\nAs old-school Italian bakeries go, it's as old school as it gets. \n\nIf you google the joint, you see that it's located on \"Corso Italia\"; in the heart of one of the city's ethnic enclaves. This is true, and if you were to drive on over you'd find yourself in the middle of kitchenware stores, clothing shops and bars, coffee shops and restaurants all blaring whatever soccer match is on TV.  But then, if you drove you'd miss how the neighbourhood changes along St. Clair. Going West on foot you pass Jewish, Jamaican, Filipino, Portuguese and Hungarian shops, with the added Thai or fusion spot thrown in for good measure. It's Toronto in a few blocks. Besides which, you get to build up your appetite. At Tre Mari, you'll need it. \n\nAsk me what's good, I'll just answer \"yes\". The space is old and worn, divided into a bakery with pastries out front and bread in the back on one side, and a hot table/cafe on the other. A small deli and refrigerated section take up some space as well, but most of their wares are available elsewhere at lower prices. \n\nThe ambiance speaks to a time before communities became tourist destinations. One one hand, service is warm and friendly. On the other, it takes a few visits before you feel completely welcome. \n\nIt's worth braving the initial indifference for some of the best bread in Toronto. Some local celebrity chefs may try to sell bread at grossly inflated prices, but it pales in comparison to Tre Mari's loaves. \n\nA lack of signage makes ordering a crapshoot, but since it's all good and inexpensive, roll the dice. I skip lighter-weight french rolls and baguettes in favour of more substantial fair; a flour-dusted Calabrese rectangle contrasts brittle crust with chewy, airy crumb. Olive and herb breads slicked with oil are softer and springier. A multigrain loaf is substantial and hearty, as is a round, docked pide bread covered in sesame seeds. If you're the DIY pizza type, it invites you to cover it in good mozzarella, then tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan for a homemade knock-off Sicilian Slice. \n\nPastries are uniformly excellent. Cannoli are worth leaving the firearms at home for. Napoleans soothe with proper custard. Donuts, while not Italian, are archetypes that put Timmy to shame. Drip coffee is pointless, but espresso-based beverages are worth a double-shot. \n\n Even better, I have yet to pay more than four dollars for a bread that could feed me for a week. \n\nThe cafe is the most interesting part of the restaurant. Apart from very decent pizza and the usual buffet suspects, the room is testament to how neighbourhoods change; it is equally divided between the people who built Tre Mari and supported it from it's birth, to a flood of Ethiopian immigrants. The groups mostly keep to themselves; unless someone scores a goal, and the place erupts as one. \n\nThat's Toronto.", 4], ["I had to order a cake for delivery at a very short notice of less than 24 hrs. I called up Tre Mari Bakery and got connected to Franco Deleo and he assured me that he'll be able to take my order even at such short notice and get it delivered. The cake I selected was one of the specialty cake which was another task which Franco accomplished perfectly. Now I was ordering this from another country and I need some flowers and balloons to be delivered along with the cake. Upon my request Franco said he will be more than willing to pick up the other stuff as well  along the way and he'll personally deliver everything together. He went out of the way to accommodate my request which was very sweet of him. Both the cake & the flowers turned out to be absolutely amazing,  everything turned out as per the plan and it got delivered exactly during the time limit which I requested. I am extremely happy with the service I received and will definitely want to visit the bakery if I get a chance to visit Canada anytime soon. \n\nThanks Franco!", 5], ["Came here for lunch and had the veal. The portion size was massive and was quite delicious. It was hard to choose just one dessert item from the bakery side because there is a huge selection. I ended up getting the pistachio cannoli and have no complaints :)", 5], ["I've read many reviews about this place so decided to give it a try. I ordered a vanilla cannoli, pistachio cannoli, strawberry butterfly, tiramisu cake slice, lemon peach and a strawberry tart. Wellll...The vanilla and pistachio cannoli's had absolutely NO flavour which was disappointing. The strawberry butterfly was very fresh, yet the filling (whipped cream) was tasteless for the exception of the strong egg flavour from the dough. The tiramisu slice was amazing, the best I've had thus far. The tiramisu was moist and filled will flavour. The lemon peach had an artificial taste to it. It literally tasted like a tim bit with a tasteless custard filling. The strawberry tart was horrible and tasteless. The filling was a whipped cream filling rather than the usual custard, which was a plus, yet the filling had no flavour. The strawberries and shell had flavour and the filling seemed like the artificial stuff supermarkets use on their birthday cakes.. I gave this place 2 stars because the tiramisu was amazing. I'm not entirely sure how this bakery got such great reviews. Their pastries definitely need some revamping.", 2], ["Just an addendum:  My partner just returned from a trip to Italy as said that the canollis he had in Naples paled in comparison to this place.\n\nThey should be called \"La Regina di Canolli\"", 5], ["The food may be very good but the service here sucks big time. Twice I have picked out a bunch of groceries and carried them to the counter only to have the girls behind he counter full out ignore me and ask the other customers to come up to be cashed out. At first I thought I was imagining this so I waited a bit until one woman who was behind me was aske to come up to be cashed out and I was still there holding my items. I placed all the my things down and left the bakery. The next time the same thing happened only this time I slammed the things down an asked them why this was happening. The girls looked at me and then continued to cash out the other customers again. So I yelled again and walked out. Never stepped foot in this place again.", 1], ["I used to not understand why people liked cannoli. It was never a dessert that tickled my fancy. Now I know that I'd just never had GOOD cannoli.

When I want to buy cookies or cannolli or sfogliatelle to take to a staff party or for when I have people over, I go here and get a beautiful selection and I'm never disappointed.

The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. \nWhen the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly.

For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.\n\nThe one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this.

It was OKAY.. It's a very big item so it was a little messy to eat. Taste-wise... I mean the entire thing from the bread to mac & cheese had such a weird texture... like rubbery and dry. It was very funky. The fries were really good and addicting though. I had a bite of my friend's crispy chicken sandwich too, a bit dry as well but a lot better than mine! \n\nService was very good though so this review got an extra star!

Soy allergies beware, this is not a place for you.\n\nTHINGS I HAVE TRIED THAT I LIKED:\n*CHICKEN BURGER: Mmmm, this is by far my favorite thing at Doomies.  I am a huge fan of fake Chicken (you guys don't have Morning Star Farms here, do you?).  I have never had good fake chicken out in the real world, so I am happy to say that this chicken burger wins.  It's fried, crispy, and just oh so good.\n*BUFFALO CHICKEN BURGER:  My dad got this and liked it.  I however am not a fan of their Buffalo sauce.  This didn't have so much sauce on it though.\n*ANIMAL FRIES:  These are my favorite version of their loaded fries.  They don't get soggy and have just the right amount of grilled onions.\n*GARLIC FRIES:  These fries are good but VERY garlic-y.  Don't get if your date doesn't like garlic.  They reheat very well though.\n*BIG MAC: My dad got this and said it was literally like eating an actual Big Mac.  Huge, but great.\n\nSide note:  The fake cheese here is really good, I usually do not like fake cheese.\n\nTHINGS I HAVE TRIED THAT I WOULD NOT GET AGAIN:\n*FRIED AVOCADO:  Tasteless.\n*BUFFALO FRIES: So much sauce that it just is overwhelming and mushy.\n*NACHO FRIES:  They weren't my dads favorite but they were good.  Must eat with fork.  I just wouldn't get these again because of how great the other fry options are.\n*CHIMICHONGA:  It's HUGE and mostly filled with peppers.  Not so many beans and fake meat.  Needed more of it.\n\nDoomies is great because even the meat-eaters at my work think it looks great ... I can't wait to come back and have it again.", 5], ["What is this place? A cool place to grab Vegan Junk Food! Now, I'm no vegan - not even vegetarian but because I love my friends, I decided to meet them at Doomie's. \n\nI have to admit, it is a very cool concept. The decor is really cool, there's little cartoon vegan comic strips with vegan humor around the restaurant. Also there's a Mini Nintendo that you can play with at the front of the restaurant. \n\nWe waited for about 15 minutes for a table (it's a small space), we were seated towards the back and the server took our drink orders. I had a lot of trouble deciding what to order. My friend and I settled for the Big Mac & the Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries. We upgraded both orders of fries to Animal Fries and Garlic Fries. \n\nThe food came out probably 25 minutes later. I personally have never had real Big Mac so I can't compare but it honestly didn't taste like anything. The pickles, Onions and sauce is where the flavor was, the soy patties had ZERO flavor, it honestly tasted like rubber. I wasn't a fan of that. The garlic fries that were paired with that were good, it was real bits of garlic and the fries had a great crispy coating. \n\nNext up was the Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich. This is what I liked, I guess fake chicken tastes more like chicken then fake meat does to real meat. I liked the crispiness and the buffalo sauce was great. The Animal Fries were amazing, fried onions and some secret sauce made for a great topping. \n\nWe obviously had to order dessert so we ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e & the Cookie with Ice Cream. The Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e  is one of the worst I've had, I think the base was some uncooked tofu, with burnt sugar on top. It wasn't creamy and had no flavor. The Cookie skillet was really good! The ice cream was surprisingly creamy - the cookie had a nice crunch around the outside and a warm center. \n\nSo all in all I enjoyed my experience here as a non vegan. I probably would not come back, if I had the option of eating a real burger and real chicken then I obviously would. I like the taste, whereas this doesn't really have a taste and is masked with sauces. I guess if I was meeting other vegans, I wouldn't mind coming back.

Jalape\u00f1os poppers were awesome. The Philly cheesesteak was the first time I ordered it and boy did I regret it. The very DNA of doomie is to end the terrible Vegan alternative atrocities we had to tolerate for so long. Yet this Philly cheesesteak was flavourless. We did not finish it. We upgraded our side of fries to the animal and nacho ones. Both were so incredibly salty so we left the whole lot as well. \n\nOnly thing we went right on was the Big Mac which I still enjoyed but my friend who came here for the first time did not finish her half at all. \n\nTo top it off our waitress must have paid us a visit 13 (exaggerating of course to exhibit how much it annoyed us lol) to see if we were done with our plates or if we wanted a box or if we were still working on it.

Great grease spoon comfort food place for vegans. \n\nI really want to go back and try some of the other things but I have to order the Big Mac from the secret menu. You just have to ask about it. It was huge and it was delicious. Seriously, if someone had told me it was real meat I don't think I would have questioned it. They also got the sauce just right. \n\nThe fries were the only let down. They were cold and not crisp.

My go-to dish here is the classic; a burger that tastes uncannily like a Big Mac, but last time I branched out and had the chick'n burger, which was tasty but dry.

The pork was mushroom, which was delicious.

The gelato was super flavourful, so for anyone who likes bananas, I would recommend this.  The bread pudding was moist and delicious!  This dessert was definitely on the sweet side.", 4], ["Wonderful restaurant located in the Junction.  Great atmosphere and good service. Best gnocchi in the city.  The riceballs are also a must try. & make sure to save room for dessert-they have a great array of scrumptious desserts. \nHighly recommend.", 5], ["My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. \n\nThe food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.", 3], ["I was in the 'hood and stopped by for a nice lunch.\n\nService is casual, not overly attentive...which is fine.  Some lupini beans / fresh bread with EVOO arrived before our food.  Both were nice!\n\nPrices were in around $20 for pizza/pastas.  The pizza was polished off, but I ate about half the pasta.  It's a healthy portion!  Between the 2 dishes, the Rigatoni with Veal Bolognese sauce was the clear winner.  Pizza was good too, thin, chewy with a slight crunch!\n\nI'd definitely go back, but may try the St. Clair location first to compare notes.  \n\nDon't forget the wine!  Most of it dry, but the organic one that I had was delish...especially with the red sauce!  Yum, yum.", 4], ["We came here for a private baptism lunch and OMG the food was AMAZING! I ate things that I typically don't and I loved it.  \n\nFor starters, we were served this really refreshing salad with pickles veggies and a light vinaigrette dressing. We then moved on to lamb skewers and pizza with prosciutto and cantaloupe.  For our pasta dish, it was this really creamy cauliflower pasta with cheese. I typically don't do creamy pastas because I'm more of a marinara girl but this dish was da bomb, second servings please!  For our main, it was chicken with rapini and roasted veggies.  The chicken was super tender and juicy, and paired with my favourite veggies.  \n\nI checked their menu and all of the above items are on their regular menu, I can't wait to go back!

The pastas are beautifully simple.  The pizza divine. The service is enthusiastic.  I'm confused by the amuse bouche of the olive oil drenched lupini beans, but no matter.  Here's a little yarn as to why they deserve 5 stars and your business: \n\nAfter a number of positive experiences, I dropped by to order a couple of pastas to go.  The bartender, who was not busy, was rude and abrasive.  He punched  in my order like a cashier at 7-11 and split.  As he left, I said \"I'd love a glass of wine while I'm waiting.\" Which he basically ignored.\n\nThe pasta arrived in a bag by a smiling kitchen runner and I got up to leave.  As I left, the manager asked \"how was everything tonight?\" I told him his bartender was an a-hole and was gobsmacked by how terribly he treated me.  His face fell. What happened next was amazing.  The manager couldn't react fast enough, saying it was entirely his fault as he hires the staff that that kind of poor behavior is unacceptable.  He produced a $50 gift card and asked to have another chance to continue to earn my business.  \n\nMy wife and I came 2 nights later and were enchanted once again.  We're loyal customers for life.  \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is restaurants have off nights.  The management can screw up.  The chef can drop the ball.  We're all human.  What counts is how management reacts to you IN PERSON gripe.  He was a gentleman and handled us with care.  \n\nGoing home and giving a restaurant one star because they forgot your dessert is ridiculous.  Saying it's expensive is ridiculous.  The menu is on the door.  \n\nYelp can be somewhat uneven and unfair in this regard which is why we returned and gave them another chance and it was well worth it.  \n\nBefore you ding a restaurant's Yelp score, talk to the management in person.  If they blow you off, leave them one star.  But in this case of perfectly executed damage control, Nodo gets 5.", 5], ["Wanting to take my wife out with our daughter to celebrate some recent success in her career, I asked her where she wanted to go for dinner. After some consideration she recalled that our last and only time visiting Nodo had been less for pleasure and more for function (we were starving and had to be somewhere very quickly) so we didn't get to truly enjoy our experience as we rushed through dinner, and vowed we'd return.\n\nSo having a reason to celebrate AND visit Nodo again was a double win. We knew they had great mains but now we would actually have a chance to enjoy.\n\nI tried to make reservations but sadly even with a baby, they wouldn't as they're packed most nights without taking a reservation. So we tried our best to get there on time/early to get a seat but failed. We were fortunate enough to grab a few seats on the bar (not an easy task with a baby in a car seat). While on the bar my wife was feeling a little weary from missing lunch that day, so we asked to order a few appetizers and a drink each to help tide us over. We had:\n\nARANCINI $9\ncrispy rice balls filled with mozzarella, peas,'rag\u00f9 di carne'\n\nCARCIOFINI FRITTI $10\ncrispy baby artichokes, lemon- caper-cucumber aioli \n\nI missed the fact that the arancini had meat in it so unfortunately, with my wife being vegetarian that was a miss for her (my bad), but I personally loved their egg shaped rice balls that were so delicious I could have easily had a plate or two of that for dinner. The artichokes were a sleeper, something we were a little weary of ordering but wanting something 100% vegetarian it seemed like a safe bet. And it was... and then some! The portion was plentiful and tasty! Definitely an out of the box MUST ORDER for the adventurous.\n\nWe were seated shortly thereafter and having just starred at the menu for 30 minutes while waiting we wasted little time, ordering a bottle of wine to share and the following:\n\nBRUSCHETTONE $14\nfresh tomato bruschetta pizza (with light mozzarella), garlic, shallots, fresh herbs, olive oil\n\n** Warning: The above, while easily the best tasting bruschetta I've had in ages, it is not Bruschetta, it's a long bruschetta pizza. Way too much for one person and damn nearly too much for two people who had mains on the way. Also a must order, especially if part of a group. **\n\nShe had...\nRIGATONI /// TRINACRIA $17\ngarlic-blitzed cherry tomato and zucchini, basil, smoked mozzarella, finished with fresh arugula, shaved ricotta salata\n... and she loved it, but was so full from the rest of our meal she could barely put a dent in it so took most of this home for lunch the next day.\n\nI had...\nGNOCCHI (OLD SCHOOL) /// RAG\u00da D'AGNELLO $19\nhomemade potato gnocchi, slow-lamb rag\u00f9, lemon-mint ricotta\n... and I loved this as well. I've had lamb ragu on a variety of different pasta vessels and at it's lightest its a hell of a heavy meal, but on gnocchi, pastas fat, filling cousin - it becomes a delicious colon clogging, artery stopping meal. THEN add in that dollop of fresh ricotta and stir it into the sauce and it becomes so insanely rich that my blood type rapidly changed TO Ragu. I would say the flavours of this dish are amazing but the mix of heavy ricotta, heavy gnocchi and lamb meat sauce make this far too heavy for anyone to manage if they've eaten anything else that afternoon. I'd have this on rigatonni or penne next time.\n\nAll in all a great meal, I wish they took resos, but they did do their best to help us out with our baby, and I want that Lamb Ragu pasta again but without the gnocchi, otherwise a near perfect experience in my books\n\nEatcrest Out", 4], ["Great ambiance ! \nGood staff here. \nAppetizers are a bit small. \nMenu selection was short. \nWine selection is alright!", 4], ["For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo.

We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it.

What did they give me!?!? See photo for reference.  There was NO seaweed and the broth was soooo NOT miso. It was more like soy sauce water. The shredded carrots were raw. The whole medley just did not make sense. I honestly felt like i was eating something from a compost bin.

If visiting, I'd skip this place", 2], ["For all of my hipster hatred, I found myself at Handlebar last night and I had a wicked time! The atmosphere was dark and cavernous, adorned with old bicycles and the overall atmosphere was a super chill vibe. They had a dance floor and some wicked peeps spinning tunes. Being the Dancing Queen that I am, I was on that dance floor all night.\n\nBartenders were super friendly and made excellent cocktails. I'm not sure if all the people sitting down were eating???But I'm assuming they have food here, too?? When I'm dancing, I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit so I deduce that there must be some other equally exciting activity to keep them in their seats.\n\nHandlebar also has what is arguably the most space age bank machine I've ever encountered.\n\nI would definitely come back here for drinks any time.", 5], ["***NEW FAVOURITE BAR***\n\nOwned by the same people who ran The Avro before it was rent-jacked out of existence, this is a place where I heartily recommend spending all of your dollars.\n\nThey have movie nights, dance nights and pleny of just totally chill nights where they play music at the perfect volume for you and whoever to easily hear each other expressing distaste with the mayor's latest performance art. Beers are well priced and the staff pay you just the right amount of attention.\n\nThere are pleny of booth and bar seats but easily the best place in the house is right by the front entrance where you can enjoy one of these small half-couches. Each one has a detachable, small oval table that's perfect for your drink. \n\nWhen you really push your butt into the couch facing the front window you're rewarded with a great view of the sky as framed by potted plants and illuminated by the lightbulb in the bicycle they have as part of the front display.

Shit, why do I keep sabotaging my LIFE?\n\nThe one complaint I have is that the bar staff wouldn't compliment my big ol' dick, no matter how many times I asked them to do so. I will, of course, be taking this up with the appropriate government regulatory body.\n\nOh, I'm just kidding, the only thing lengthy about my dick would be the tragic poems it inspires on account of being so dang terrible.", 5], ["Visited from out of town with my boyfriend.

I don't spend as much time in Kensington Market as I used to but I've always liked this place as the general vibe is chill but approachable. After getting past the bar you'll find a decent sized dancefloor and then the one wall lined with booths which are pretty comfy.\nMost nights I've been here the music seemed secondary to peoples reasoning for being there, which might match the fact that the sound system doesn't seem to be the highest quality. The Denon mixer being used by the dj probably doesn't help that either. But there are a lot of speakers hung from various parts of the walls so I imagine when the place fills up they can keep it pretty rocking in there.\n\nDrinks are reasonably priced and they've got some good craft beer options on tap. \n\nTheir website has a full monthly calendar of events which ranges from dj nights to live music to storytelling events and a wide variety of other random events.

Came here this past weekend with my boyfriend to start off my birthday celebration and it was a great start. TOCA is located on the second floor of the Ritz Carlton and it's decorated very festive due to Christmas coming up but it was very welcoming. \n\nThis restaurant wasn't overpacked and hectic like other breakfast places instead it was very calm and relaxing. Seating was very comfortable and we had the option to order from the menu or experience the breakfast table. We opted for the breakfast table and it was very simple including an omelette station (kudos to the gentlemen there because he made the perfect egg whites omelette).\n\nOne of my favourites of the breakfast table is the bottled juices that are available and the green juice was delicious. My boyfriend and I were able to enjoy both coffee and green juice in the same meal. I don't think I've been to a breakfast 'buffet' that included green juice which was a wonderful addition. \n\nOverall I would come back here for the lovely atmosphere and calming experience. I think the brunch would be very worthwhile so I'll keep in mind next time. Service was good but not excellent, minor details but nothing to express concern over. It would have been nice if our server was slightly more attentive but all in all, a nice place to enjoy a simple breakfast.", 4], ["Was here for their weekend brunch and overall the experience was great, it's not 5 stars because for $99 I would expect perfection but there were bits that could be improved.\n Pros: \n1. VERY fresh oysters. I love oysters but have a sensitive stomach, so if they're even slightly unfresh I would feel sick afterwards. Did not happen here, I would say it's even better than some a la carte restaurants and its all you can eat! They keep it stocked throughout the duration so I would come back just for that alone.\n2. I also love truffles and hey had a truffle infused pasta dish that was so tasty, amazing for a buffet! I had 3 or 4 helpings in one sitting.\n3. General atmosphere and quality of food was really good, the plating was very nice and you can tell care was taken into the cooking. i think they only seat half of the restaurant during brunch so it was not busy, you don't need to line up for anything and everything was always fully stocked. Servers were quick at taking away empty plates and refilling the drinks.\n\nCons:\n1. Chicken and the prime rib was a bit dry and over cooked. Did not finish my pieces.\n2. Some dishes I saw on the online menu was not served. For example I really like heirloom carrots and caprese salad and wanted to try the goat cheese ravioli but it was not available. However they also served dishes that were not in the online menu like polenta and steak tartare. They do say it's the sample menu online but I'm the type of person that decides on what I want to eat before going to a restaurant so it's a bit risky if you're like me.\n\n Others notes:\nI personally don't like sweets but they had a big variety of desserts. I wonder if they switch it up by the season because for us they had little ghost and tombstone cookies for Halloween, very cute!", 4], ["This fancy restaurant is located on the second floor of the Ritz Carlton - walking in, you'll notice the large cheese cellar, as well as the open kitchen. Our table had these very pretty plates on each seat acting as placeholder; I went straight to the one with the Prince of Bel-Air. Apparently there's an artist who hand paints these designs on each plate, and she was here introducing her products the last time my colleagues came.\n\nWe had a fixed set menu offering choices for an appetizer (caprese or porchetta), primi (no choice, it was the lobster gigli), secondi (branzino or lamb / agneau), and finally, dolce (tiramisu or panna cotta).\n\nWe were served bread and olive oil to start, and then each handed a gazpacho shooter. The soup was okay, quite aromatic but also just very similar to V8 in flavour. As we drank our wine and chatted, we were served our appetizers.\n\nEveryone at the table chose the caprese - and it was a fantastic choice. A generous disk of fresh mozzarella cheese was placed atop a slice of tomato, with some simmered tomato sauce at the bottom. The cheese was so good; it had such depth and texture.\n\nOur primi came a little while later. The al dente gigli was the perfect vessel for coating the creamy sauce, and each plate had a decent chunk of lobster meat. It was quite good and homely, and I found myself chasing after the sauce.\n\nThe secondi came next; I was the only one around the table who ordered the branzino. Everyone raved about the lamb racks, and I found my branzino okay. I wasn't as big a fan of the tomato sauce, but the branzino itself was well seasoned and fried to be quite crispy. I did find, however, the accompaniments of squid bits and mussels a tad peculiar. This one dish was a slight miss for me.\n\nWe then ordered a cheese board to share, and there were a variety of cheeses served. One of the boards included blue cheese, but both had pecorino, parmesan, and some other of your usual suspects.\n\nFinally, dessert came. Again, everyone around the table got the tiramisu unanimously. Unfortunately, I found this particular presentation to be lacking as well. There was a ball of gelato and thin disk of chocolate served alongside a demi sphere of tiramisu. The tiramisu was okay, but nothing groundbreaking.\n\nAs we had ordered two bottles of white (a beautifully buttery and complex Dom Bonneau du Martray 2007) and three separate different reds (each wonderful in their own right), the sommelier gave us a 1983 vintage port on the house.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful evening - the food was decently good with some hits but other misses, but the wine was excellent. Service was phenomenal, and we had a great time!", 4], ["We enjoyed a mussel platter which was a good size and completely shareable, followed by the sea bass stuffed with squid and herbs placed atop of a simple tomato sauce, and finished the meal off with the classic Ritz-Carlton orange dark chocolate cake. The food was simple, but I was expecting it to be a little more flavourful. Our server was also less than pleasant. She seemed exhausted, and unhappy to be there. However, the rest of the staff provided what I expected as the Ritz quality of service. The combination of the poor service we received and having slightly bland food is why I gave this restaurant 3 stars.", 3], ["Upscale Italian restaurant in the Ritz. \n\nService: The waiter was very friendly, highlighting the daily specials and recommendations. Albeit the restaurant was quite empty for a Wednesday lunch service. Seating was also a bit awkward, as it was a round table with a coach and chairs for two.\n\nFood: The complimentary focaccia was perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside, definitely some of the better I've had. The mezzi ziti was cooked al dente, and was flavoured nicely and topped with shaved Parmesan, table side. However, the price was a bit high for a pasta dish, especially for lunch, and it seemed a bit simple.\n\nOverall: Commendable pasta and focaccia, but pricey for a lunch.", 3], ["My husband brought me here for our anniversary and we had the most amazing Saturday brunch. The buffet was amazing - there were different types of seafood including fresh oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, and lobsters. They constantly refilled the seafood station which was great and we certainly had our fair share of oysters! They had breakfast food like eggs benedict, sausages, bacon, and this delicious banana bread French toast (highly recommend). There was also chicken, vegetables, fish, and even pasta. You will also find a nice salad bar but to be honest I skipped this completely because seafood over salad any day.\n\nDessert is located in a neat little room in the middle of the restaurant - chocolate fondue with fruits and marshmallows, chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, petits choux... selection was definitely decent. Word of caution - near the end of the buffet they don't restock the dessert so try to get your hands on dessert earlier and don't wait until the last minute!\n\nAside from the delicious food the brunch comes with bottomless mimosas. Bottomless meaning they keep refilling your drink (which they really do).\n\nService was spectacular. We were celebrating a special occasion (as with some of the other diners) and they made us feel really welcome. They even prepared a cute dessert plate to wish us a happy anniversary.

Absolutely heavenly and would definitely recommend and return! Be sure to make a reservation!", 4], ["I have been wanting to try TOCA's Sunday brunch buffet for over 2 years, but didn't really have an event to celebrate to justify the cost. However, when I found out that they were having a Saturday brunch buffet for a reduced price, I decided to make the splurge. \n\nThe hot food variety on Saturday is significantly less than what they offer on Sunday, which they have fairly stated on their online menu. However, they still had the \"breakfast staples\" such as sausages, bacon, pancakes and egg benedicts. Other hot food includes a lamb stew, roasted vegetables, a pan fried fish dish in a broth and a pasta dish. Nonetheless, the main reason why I wanted to go to TOCA was for their seafood bar (lobsters, king crab legs, oysters and smoked fish), which they also serve on Saturday. So to me, I find it more value for money to go on a Saturday. \n\nThe lobsters were smaller than expected, approximately 2-3 ounces per tail. Most of the ones I ate had a decent texture, but there was approximately 2 half tails I had that were quite chewy (over-blanched?). I was surprised that the crab legs have a \"strong\" sweet crab flavour! As most of the time the crab legs are tasteless and often have a hint of \"icy\" flavour as they are not completely defrosted. I also really enjoyed the smoked salmon and trout. They had a hint of smokey-ness and was mildy salted. The cocktail shrimps were big and had a \"crispy\" texture! The oysters were \"meh\". They were really small, sometimes shriveled up and occasionally quite \"fishy\". I only had a few (max 5) as I was afraid my stomach won't be able to handle it. \n\nAnother thing I was looking forward to at TOCA was their cheese, since they have a cheese cave (which is a glass room and not really a cave). However the 3 cheeses they had on offered were disappointing. The blue cheese variety didn't have the \"tangy\" kick. The other two cheeses were hard cheeses, which typically suggest they are aged and should have a bold flavour profile. However, they were prerty much tasteless and some pieces tasted \"chalky\". I was also disappointed that TOCA didn't label their cheese. They only had a generic sign saying \"Selection of Artisan Cheese\". In the future, I hope TOCA would replace one of the hard cheese with a soft cheese like triple cream brie. \n\nI'm not a dessert kind of person, but I know Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong are famous for their dessert. Hence, I assumed the dessert served at TOCA would be similar. The desserts were beautifully presented and overall, they were pretty good! They had a decadent chocolate cake, a pistachio apricot mousse, creme brulee and a chocolate fondue. My favourite was the mousse. The sweetness was well balanced, the mousse was smooth and creamy. The creme brulee was a tad too sweet for me but had quite a significant amount of vanilla bean seed! The chocolate cake was rich but was too sweet for me. I would suggest sharing the piece. However, I do like the layers of moist chocolate cake and chocolate ganache.\n\nTip: Be prepared that for the first 30 mins of the buffet, most of the dishes (except for the desserts and salads) would be empty or only have a few pieces left. It's not that the food is replenished slowly (TOCA did a good job replenishing and service was great!), it's just that everyone was hungry. Plus, on the day I went 95% of the tables were filled.", 4], ["Toca is inside Ritz Carlton and you need to go through the hotel to get to the restaurant since it is on the upper floor. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing.\n\nIn regards to food, I came here twice and thought it was pretty average. Nothing really impressed me much. What I like is their selection of wine and cheese. They have a cheese cave here so I think this makes a great place to get a drink and enjoy some cheese. But I won't recommend coming here for a full meal since their food is just okay. \n\nOverall, a nice atmosphere and it is a decent spot for wine.", 3], ["My wife and I dined there a couple of days ago. It's located in the beautiful Ritz-Carlton. The quality of the food was outstanding. The service exceeded my expectations. Toca never disappoints. \n\nThey have an incredible spread of shellfish (including freshly shucked oysters), charcuterie, cheese, desserts, salads and all the traditional brunch foods. I had the Fagottelli pasta, with braised rabbit cacciatore.

In all fairness, I went on a Saturday- apparently Sunday food selection is better?\n\nAmbience: 4/5\nIt's very relaxed, not too loud: a place you could have a conversation with the person across from you and not yell.\n\nFood: 1/5\nThe food selection was extremely limited. Yes there were lobster tails - I asked for butter and that took a while to come. The oysters were dry, I've heard of small oysters but not dry. The mussels had a bad after taste, and it disintegrated in my mouth. The clams were just ok. \n\nIn terms of everything else, they had eggs benny which were just ok. Sausages that were wrinkly and dry. My plate was mainly the cheese, hard croissants, and lobster.\n\nThey tell you it's bottomless mimosas but don't be fooled. You have to CONSTANTLY ask to get a refill, for a table of 6- I want to say I might of had 2 or 3 mimosas. The wait time for a refill ranges between 5-10 minutes. If the person is pouring your drink, and they have run out of either the champagne or orange juice expect them to return in 5-10 minutes.\n\nI asked for a Bellini towards the end, and the waiter pointed to the end of the table and said \"who's drinking that one?\" I found that extremely rude since someone was sitting in front of that drink and simply taking their time. I wonder if she was implying I should just take that drink.\n\nFor approx $100/person. Save your money. You can get better food and service elsewhere. \n\nWill not be coming back.", 2], ["Went for a weekday lunch.  The service was excellent but atmosphere was low-key as the restaurant was almost empty.  Great if you want a quiet place to have a private lunch but not so good if you need a scene.

The customer service is impeccable and they are very accommodating of dietary restrictions.", 5], ["I came here for Saturday brunch for my birthday with my close friends and family. It's located inside the Ritz Carlton on the upper main floor. There's a large staircase in the lobby leading to the restaurant. The service is amazing, international and light Italian food is delicious, unique and perfectly portioned, it's reasonably priced with the Saturday brunch prix fix menu. I'd recommend coming here for casual brunch or an occasion brunch with the prix fix menu! I'd come back to try their Sunday $85/89 brunch and their dinner menu next time. \n\nPros: Amazing and attentive service, consistent refills for drinks and check-in's felt natural. Coat check when you walk into the restaurant. I had to push back my reservation by 15-20 mins and they accommodated it ASAP. It helped that it wasn't busy for brunch, only about 1/3 of the restaurant was full. The food was really delicious, somewhat small but filling portions for the prix fix menu. I was full by time the dessert came around!  \n\nCons: Service was a bit slow in the beginning with 2 different servers. It wasn't too busy, only about 15-20 people there for brunch besides our table of 5, and we were given a booth in the corner. Since my reservation changed from 7 people to 5 (I called way in advance to note that), I would have appreciated a closer knit table, versus a very large booth where we were all spread out. It's a pretty quiet atmosphere, I imagine a packed evening would be much louder. The mimosa's are definitely expensive, we each got 2-3 each and a few peach bellini's which was over $30 at that point per person. Would have benefitted more from a bottomless mimosa fixed price! Not much of a choice with 2-4 choices for brunch drinks. \n\nMenu: Saturday a la carte is a bit more expensive but larger portions. If you want to have a bit of everything, sweet and savoury (which I LOVE for brunch) and well worth your money, then DEFINITELY get the Saturday prix fix menu. It's different than presented online on their website, and I took a photo of the menu too. For the 2-course prix fix ($27, or with a cocktail $39) and 3-course prix fix menu ($32, or with a cocktail $44)--worth it for it's price! I had the 3-course menu with a mimosa ($16, ugh) - Insalata Di Cavolo, Salmone Affumicato, Signature Banana Bread French Toast. All great components with unique twists. French toast was my favourite! We each got something different and every single person finished their portions and their meal, so it was delicious and just the right amount of food. You get an individualized mini vanilla and chamomile maple syrup! \n\nAtmosphere: There's a darker dimly lit space by the kitchen with circular booths and tables for small groups and larger long tables, and a more open-concept natural light space. There is a cheese cave tour as well, I saw it but didn't have time to check it out.\n\nSummary: I'd go back on a busy night for their dinner, it was great service, consistent refills on water and mimosa's, I'd love to see a bit more variety on the menu, but I'd bring a group of friends or family back here again. The prix fix menu is MUCH better than paying the $32 or $25 per dish, when you can try more items for the same price and get your money's worth!", 4], ["This review is for the Sunday Brunch buffet, which doesn't come cheap and yet worth every penny if you are a seafood lover.\n\nFor the price you pay, it is all you can drink bellinis (or just sparkling wine if you ask them to hold the juice) - not top shelf stuff obviously, but still satisfying.\n\nThe seafood section is amazing - lobster tails (good texture, not mushy), mussles, oysters, crab claws, shrimp, along with numerous little dishes. I could just feast on this section alone!\n\nThen there are the normal hot dishes, which I mostly ignored (since I came for the seafood) but looked decent. I had a slice of the prime rib and it was delicious and of good quality. \n\nOn top of this, the dessert cave is phenomenal. The wait staff advised us to check it out before eating so we'll know to save our appeities, and you definitely should!

I had the fresh seafood pasta and the cod. The pasta is homemade. It is also my understanding that tomatoes are flown in from Italy for the pasta sauce.  TOCA puts a huge emphasis on fresh ingredients and it makes all the difference. Everything I have tried at TOCA was nothing short of delicious. You cannot go wrong at TOCA.\n\nI also heard TOCA had a cheese cave (which I did not visit this time around but will definitely need to visit next time).", 4], ["I've visited Toca three times now.\n\nEach time the service has been phenomenal. The ambience is great.\n\nMy first experience was my best experience, I had their burger at lunch which was amazing. It was a special burger that seemed to be on their seasonal lunch menu.\n\nThe second time I came for lunch again, I ordered the same burger but they had taken that burger off the menu. So instead , I ordered their classic burger which turned out to be mediocre. \n\nThe third time I came was for dinner. I had a five course truffle inspired meal with wine pairing. It was specially created by chef Oliver Glowig.\n\nIt was a phenomenal experience. However, I'll admit that my palette isn't ready for such high end food yet. I don't think I appreciated the quality of the wine nor the quality of the truffles. I then took a picture with the chef. The scallops and the sweet bread were out of this world !", 4], ["This review is only for the Sunday brunch at Toca. We have been twice to the Toca brunch. There are two seating are available, one at 11:30 am and another at 2:00 pm. I would highly recommend making a reservation and getting there right on time! The restaurant has great service, and you don't feel rushed at all. Both times we have sat until the end of service and the servers kept filling our mimosas. You want to eat and drink as much food as possible. \n\nThe price for brunch is $89. This includes unlimited mimosas and access to a Caesar bar. The mimosas are awesome and your glass is never empty. In terms of the food, I know some reviews say there wasn't enough selection, but I like the Toca brunch because there are perhaps fewer items than a traditional buffet would have, but they are done very well. The seafood bar is unreal. There are oysters, shrimp, crab legs, smoked salmon and various other types of fish depending on the day you go. There is a salad bar next to the seafood station, which also has some interesting creations. Last time there was a salad with roasted peaches and goat cheese - it was delicious. But, the delights don't end here. \n\nThere is also a beef Wellington station. The meat is juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. The pasta station is fantastic. I also am a huge fan of the breakfast items - the selection is small, but the donuts, eggs Benedict, bacon and sausage are unreal. If you have ANY room at this point, the dessert cave is pretty decent. It doesn't blow me away with items like mini tiramisu, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and panna cotta. They're pretty good, but not amazing. \n\nSure, the breakfast is expensive. But, it's an experience. The service and food are both excellent. We love coming here for a special occasion, and feel we get really good value!", 5], ["Came here for a celebration and it was a great experience.  The Sunday brunch was delicious with a wide selection and impeccable service.  Definitely worth coming to try!\n\nFood: \nLots of selection including wide array of cheeses, classic breakfast food (like eggs benedict, sausages, hummus), flatbread pizza, carving station, seafood bar, sushi, salads and dessert cellar.  Everything was wonderful but I have to say I really enjoyed the beef at the carving station and seafood bar.  Unlimited oysters, lobster, crab legs and shrimp that were already peeled so that it was easy to eat. The dessert cellar is amazing, lots of selection of great desserts (I think there were at least 10 types of desserts).  \n\nDecor and Service: \nVery nice with great service.  The decor is very comfortable and soothing.

We were seated right away despite being a few minutes early for our reservation and were greeted by our waiter immediately. All of the food was displayed beautifully and tasted even better! There are traditional breakfast items (scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon),along with a full seafood bar and many other options. For a reasonable fee, you can add on endless mimosas and the waiters/waitresses are attentive and refill often. As another bonus, the restaurant is beautiful! We had a wonderful time and will be back during our next trip to Toronto!", 5], ["2.5 stars is the max I can give Toca for Sunday brunch.\n\nLike some other reviews, I found that the selection is very limited and food taste average.  The highlight are lobster tails and oysters- lobsters are ok and small, oysters are small thin east coast oysters (something like malpeque).  Both are not great quality like we order separately at restaurants.  Egg benedict taste awful with the hard English muffin and tough pork layer.  Smoked salmon, prosciutto, cold small dishes etc are all not the best quality too.  When everything taste just average I don't think it's worth $89, you are mainly paying for the name Ritz Carlton.  Buffet in Vegas or Asia hotels offer much better food for this price.  Desserts cave is disappointing too, I can make better pana cotta. \n\nThe service is also the minimal you can get, I have experienced better services in other restaurants in town.  They give you what you ordered and that's it.  I've a baby with me, when I asked for hot water to warm up the milk, my server made us wait for a long time.  I saw her busy giving cakes with candles for other tables instead of giving some special attention to my table which has a hungry baby.  Eventually we had to go around to find hot water ourselves, it drawn attention from other servers, then wait again to have it.  We were celebrating our baby's arrival too but she didn't give me any cakes with candles. \n\nThe whole buffet experience was so rushed that I didn't have time to take photos to put on Yelp!  I was rushing through fetching food and eating.  Just got to try once of everything (remember not a large selection).  For that price, with a hotel environment I expect to be able to chat and celebrate the special occasion (which people come here for).  Today's experience was disappointing for us all. \n\nThe only thing we like is the seating, we like the location of our table.", 2], ["I heard really good things about this place so I decided to host my birthday here. Sadly I was extremely disappointed. The food selection is very limited, $74 for brunch and not much to eat. It was basically a salad bar with seafood and a few other items consisting of chicken, sausage, bacon, etc,. Not much to eat. The service is not wonderful either, it took a while to get assistance from them and I'd often have to repeat my order before it came. (You have to order coffee and bellinis from them). The mimosas could definitely be served in a much more effective way. Each time you want a refill you have to flag down a waiter who will then call someone over to refill your drinks. Due to the fact that there's a seating limit, that takes away from the time you actually get to drink which limits the amount you're able to drink; since it is bottomless mimosas and a 2 hour seating limit. A much more effective way is having the drinks available at the bar and having glasses already prepared so people can grab it as they please instead of having to wait to be served. And you can reinforce some sort of mechanism to differ people of age and people who are not of age to drink. I was extremely disappointed and will definitely not be returning.", 1], ["Decent service 3/5\nAtmosphere 4.5/5 \nFood quality 4/5\nFood portion 1/5 \n\nIf you would like to go on a diet, definitely come here. The portions are so tiny, I was hungry after eating the entire bread/crackers basket and my entree sized meal (they have appetizer size meals). I weigh less than 100lb so it's not like I'm a huge eater. The portions are just so small, it's like going to sample foods. Speaking of sampling, they sell wines starting at 3oz glasses. \n\nFood tasted very good, but there are a LOT of other restaurants that have better or same quality food at way lower price points. My duck pasta tasted like good beef dumplings from China town for $5. \n\nAtmosphere is nice. \n\nService was okay. I think there were several tables of business men who were regulars here, that our waitress was more focused on serving. Therefore our food was brought out by the table cleaners, not our waitress herself. He handed me ground pepper shakers that had no ground pepper in it. I tried to flag down our waitress and she was busy serving the regulars, by the time she came around my pasta was cold and I was pepper-less. \n\nOverall, it was good but I'm not interested in coming back.", 3], ["I booked the private dining area for brunch for a bridal shower.  There was no extra cost for the room, we just had to spend a specific amount of money.  As long as 10 guests showed up, it would cover the cost.  I had to leave a credit card number for the reservation, but nothing was charged to it, and we were able to have separate bills at the end of the day.\n\nOverall, I was a little disappointed.  I had been to a private event at the Ritz (in one of the ballrooms) before and was absolutely amazed at the quality of the food and the service.  Based on that, and also based on the cost of the whole thing, I kind of expected 5 star service.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was amazing.  They had beef wellington at the carving station (one of my favourite dishes, that you don't see very often).  They had a \"pasta\" station.  I thought they'd cook made to order pasta, but in fact we learned that they cook one kind for the day.  On the day we went it was actually risotto, not pasta.  The truffle risotto was incredible though.  They had a decent selection of food, though it wasn't the largest brunch buffet I've seen.  Quality over quantity, however.  Everything I put into my mouth was delicious.\n\nWhat really disappointed me was the service, however.  Since we had the private dining area, with 14 people, I would have thought we would have a private server, or at the very least, a server that paid attention to us!  Especially for the price we're paying.  We often had to flag down someone (usually not our server) to get re-fills on drinks, or have the plates cleared.  Speaking of drinks...do they water them down?  I had 5 drinks (asked to go heavier on the champs rather than the juice), and I didn't even have a buzz, and I'm a light weight!  The rest of my party said the same thing. \n\nOne thing to be aware of as well, is that they stop serving food and drinks at 4pm.  We had a 2:30pm sitting.  By the time everyone arrived and we said our hellos, we only had an hour to eat.  I thought that would be enough time, but between wandering around to see everything, eating and socializing, it seemed like we were rushing.  That being said, I was completely stuffed afterwards.  If you had a small group, it's probably fine.  But if you have a large party, I'd suggest going to an earlier sitting just so you have lots of time.", 3], ["Second time in two weeks but it doesn't change my last experience.  \nLike last time I ordered the smoke salmon egg benidick.  Instead of letting them cook how they want; I told the server to have my pouch egg medium.  But....... I was Exteremly runny...... Other than the doness of the eggs; the rest of the plate is yummy.  The smoke salmon has nice apply smoke favor but is not salty.  The English muffin is the best I've ever had so far in toronto.  One thing I should highlight is the harshbrown, it was in prefect texture with a bit of carrot in it.", 2], ["The highly acclaimed Sunday brunch buffet! \n\nWas it worth it? All in all, I'd say no, but perhaps I've been to so many buffets? \n\nThe most impressive station was the cold bar where all the lobster tails, shrimps, oysters, mussels, and crab claws resided. All the seafood was fresh and plentiful. Oysters were small but very tasty. My favourite was the lobster tail which was perfectly cooked, sweet & tender and not chewy. There's also a selection of really tasty grilled antipasto veggies, but you don't want to fill up too much on that! Other unexciting mentionables at the same bar.. sushi (small selection, nothing special).. Salad... Some small plates of shrimp. We did enjoy the roast need carving station though! \n\nThe hot area didn't have a huge selection. My favourite dish was a Mediterranean style pizza - but I didn't come to the $79 buffet for pizza! There was chicken, pasta, soup, and some breakfast items. Nothing to write home about here either. Actually the Benedict was pretty good. \n\nThe buffet also comes with bottomless mimosas, bellinis and Caesars - none of these Cocktails were very very basic. \n\nAnd to end things on a high note...the dessert is served in their wine cellar - very cool! I pretty much had one of everything and it was spectacular!!! There were not hot or made to order desserts but no complaints on my end! I loved every single bite. \n\nHighlights again were the seafood and the dessert but all in all for that price I couldn't say it was all worth it... I was expecting more! \n\nFor a Sunday buffet brunch at a more reasonable cost, I really enjoyed Hot House.", 4], ["Food was good if you can eat 100 bucks worth of oysters and lobster.  Other wise I think there are better options.\n\nIf you're looking for something fancy in the city Toca is a great spot. Otherwise I would suggest Spencers by the lake.

Toca dessert is definitely better then Spencers. \n\nOr maybe even try the old Mill Inn. The cold station isn't as impressive nor it's dessert display.  It's hard to top Toca  wine cellar dessert station presentation.  Especially when they have 5 bottles of 95 Petrus laying around.

It was flavourful with leek and a cumin taste. \n- There are other varieties of momos to try and I definitely hope to be back for more\n\nCons:\n- The location is a quite far from the downtown core and from the Queen St W area.

You place your order in the front and seat yourself and when the order is ready, they bring the food to your table. Tibetans dumplings are different than your traditional Chinese dumplings, the skin is a lot thicker, a more heavier seasoning and a musky taste but in a very good way. The steamed momos were okay but the deep fried momos were fantastic, perfectly fried and when you bite into it, the juices explode into your mouth. The accompanying hot sauce was also very delicious.\n\nWhen we were there on a recent Saturday afternoon it wasn't too busy but they do seem to do a lot of takeout business. The place was pretty clean and the staff and owner are really friendly. I definitely recommend Loga's Corner if you want to try traditional Tibetan dumplings and the prices are dirt cheap, the prices on the chalkboard include tax.", 4], ["I've been going here since this place replaced Chicken Plus during my high school days. I'm so glad to see Eddie Huang and Matty Matheson give Loga's the recognition he deserves and introduce Tibetan/Nepali food to mainstream media. \n\nLoga is an extremely warm and friendly dude, and I respect the hustle he's been running in the early days of his business because it was always just him and one other person in the back making momos. \n\nThe steamed beef momos will be the only thing I'll always get and I'm perfectly fine with that! It packs so much flavour and it's so fragrant that it'll leave you with momo breath for hours haha. I'll always recommend this place to any dumpling lover.", 5], ["Loga's corner is soooo good, most delicious momos I have ever had. Cheap and delicious  The owner is always the sweetest! So friendly and welcoming! Check this place out! You won't regret it!", 5], ["Had take out and it was absolutely delicious. Had the beef momo's and the potatoes balls. Pricing was very reasonable. Very nicely spiced. A true hidden gem!", 5], ["Hard not to like and appreciate this spot.\nOwner was very friendly, helpful (1st time).  He appears quite fond of Matty Matheson and Eddie Huang (how I heard of it), mentioned Matty has a very good heart..  nice establishment!\nThe Momo's were great, I prefer the Fried (part of my problem!), Beef and chicken excellent, I don't care for the vegetable.  Potato balls also good. Fair prices.\n\nOh and the hot sauce, amazing!", 5], ["I am frankly not a fan of momos or dumplings, but their momos conquered me! I tried beef and chicken options, both are delicious. Each momo is perfectly molded, contains decent amount of meat and small portion of liquid broth inside. These components all together creates delicious composition of tastes in one bite. Love it! Will be back again many many times.", 5], ["Im for one who loves dumplings, and i just wanted to marry and make babies with these momos. They were out of the fried momos the day i went, but the steamed ones also did the trick. The spicy slaw is dangerously addictive and great when paired with the mango lassi. Cant go wrong with beef,  also had the veggies. Go with a crowd, order a big spread, leave happpy", 5], ["Loga is a sweetheart, all three meats are all delicious (i dont really do anything veggie). Their lassi!! I wish i can have like 5 of them.", 5], ["Simply put... one of the best dumplings you'll ever have.\n\nAlmost every cuisine in the world has a dumpling- it's a fundamental comfort food.

Totally worth the time.", 5], ["i'm obsessed with their beef momo's and hot sauce. i keep buying them, and yet i continue to crave them. the potato balls also have a great punch of flavour, and they're so cheap!\n\nalso the staff are very friendly.", 5], ["Call it patio perfect! During a summer day of Ossington shopping on the weekend, we swung by here for some quick and snacky spring rolls. Inside was nice and cool, but outside was a great side patio that was made for just watching the day go by. \n\nTHESE SPRING ROLLS. They were everything. They were steaming hot. Stunningly crisp and inside was a mix of cabbage, carrot and glass noodles inside. For dipping, a thin, salty, sweet sauce on the side.  \n\nHaving been here other times, the soups have been super yummy and filling with all the accoutrements on the side. That broth. For ordering, you're given a piece of paper where you can mark down what you want. Service can be pretty quick and it is cash only, but there's an ATM on site.", 5], ["We went here on a Thursday afternoon. It was pretty busy. \nI ordered the chicken bao and my friend ordered the chicken fried rice and the other one ordered the beef pho. The chicken bao was quite good with really tender chicken pieces. The fried rice was okay as it did not have much flavour and it was oozing oil which was difficult to eat by the end of it. The pho was good. I've had better pho before. Overall could have been better.\n\nCan improve a lot on the ambience and neatness of the restaurant.", 3], ["Your average run of the mills pho restaurant! Tried the fresh rolls and my friends ordered pho. We waited for about 20 min on a Friday night, it was packed!", 4], ["Pho at the Golden Turtle is good, but not good enough for the horrible customer service they provide. Every time I go there, I always forget just how bad the service is there. Why do I do this? The pho isn't that great compared to other locations. \n\nToday, we were came in for a late lunch and was sat in one of the smaller four tops. My friends are a little larger and asked to move to the next table which was a four top. Right away the male server told us, \"No, you sit where we tell you to sit\". My friends tried to explain to him why we needed the table, but the simple answer was no, and that it was for deuces only. \n\nSo, we order and just let it go, then another group walks in and they are a four... Yup they sit them at the table we asked for. So, my friends were seriously annoyed, and I smooth things over and just go with it. As we order, I ask if I can get some satay sauce on the side of my pho, since every other pho place in the world will to that for you lol and apparently, that was a no. Their boss doesn't want that to happen, and we can only have it in the soup. \n\nNeedless to say, this experience is the last straw.

(I have several)\n\nAfter several awkward minutes, the son condescendingly agreed to walk me to the back to see that they indeed had never touched such a cup.  After two steps towards the back, I saw my mug in a bin and left. They were loud and hostile, and refused to apologize.

Pho soups are good, broth is a bit saltier than in other places, but when you add sriracha and ho sin it tastes the same.

The sitting is just as cramped, the chairs and tables are more worn out and the floor looks like it needs a serious acid wash.\n\nThe service is ok, but nothing special, just like any other Pho place.  \n\nDon't believe the hype, there's nothing special about the Golden Turtle, just another hole-in-the-wall Pho place, alike dozens in the neighborhood.", 2], ["My friend took me here for the first time back in the spring.

The crowd was very, well, not-Vietnamese.", 4], ["DO NOT GO HERE. I've never experienced such horrible customer service while going out to eat. I went here to order pho and noticed that there wasn't enough noodle that you originally would get in a large size order, so I politely told the server I believe was the owners daughter, if I can get some more noodle because there was barely any noodle in my bowl it was mainly soup, she said yes and brings me a small bowl of it 5 minutes later. It was more then I asked for I said I only wanted a little bit but I didn't complain and went on with my meal. Now here is where things turn sideways. When I received my bill I noticed that I got charged for the extra noodle. I asked the server why I got charged extra when I specially told her I only wanted a little bit more since there wasn't enough noodle to begin with, I wasn't asking for extra, and she didn't even tell me it would be charged extra in the first place, she said that there's nothing they can do and that I'll have to pay for the extra noodle. Now my issue wasn't paying for the extra noodle it was the principle that my bowl didn't have enough noodles to begin with, and if I'm paying for something it should be made properly. I told her that I'm  only going to pay for the bowl since it wasn't fair to pay for an extra amount of noodle that should have been in my bowl in the first place. So I went next door to get change before they were accusing my of dining and dashing when I made myself clear I was coming back with the exact amount to pay for the bowl, the owner goes inside when she clearly sees I'm getting change from the bartender and starts yelling and making a scene that I'm dining and dashing. Then she goes outside and waits. At this point I'm bewildered and what is happening, that even the bartender that was giving me change , even agreed that most restaurants would just void the mistake and not go chasing the customer over $2.50. After I got the exact amount to pay the bill I go inside and give it to the cashier. I hear the owner in front of the store asking the girl at the cashier  if I paid for the extra noodle and I says no, and what does she do? SHE BARRICADES ME AND LOCKS ME INSIDE SO I CANT GET\nOUT! At this point I don't know if I should laugh or cry because I'm just in complete shock over what's happening. All over something that could have been voided as a mistake from the server. At this point I'm made to feel bullied to pay for an extra charge which I'm not gonna allow so I tell her to move so I can leave. Her and her daughter are standing by the door, I tried to move her as at this point I feel threatened for my own safety and she doesn't move and is being verbally abusive to me. It's when I pull out my phone and start video recording what's happening when she finally gives in and opens the door while yelling that I'm not allowed back in her restaurant like I even want to ever come back after the harassment I just experienced. When I'm on the door out the street, the owner subtly kicks me and that's when I wasn't having it, I told her to kick me again while her son is holding her back and she continues to be verbally abusive. At this point I just walk away and tell her that she needs help because you do not treat customers or people in that form what so ever. I should have read the reviews before coming here because it seems it's not the first time there's been a complain of lack of customer service in this establishment. Would never step foot in this place even if you paid me.", 1], ["Best pho in the city!! It's so fast, don't be thrown off by the full house or line up out the door.

I asked the server what was served to me just moments before, he looked at the spring roll and advised that it contained pork. I told him immediately that I was vegetarian and this was unacceptable - all I got was a blank stare, so I took my coat and left.

It really hit the spot and their bacon is sooooo good. My sister and I got a half order (they do half offers which is fantastic since it fulfills your craving of something sweet when you order something savoury) of their nutella pancakes.

It's the dates themselves in these ones that weren't as gooey and sweet as I would've liked. I really wished I liked these.\n\nWalnut Butter Square- 4/5. I liked these! But not as much as the Jam cookies. They had a nice chewiness and the flavors weren't as sweet. I would get it again probably depending on my mood.\n\nBrownie- 2/5. I don't know what went wrong here but these tasted very bland and cardboard-like. I think I might've just gotten a bad one but wouldn't want to try this again.\n\nAll in all, the sweets here are good for a coffee shop.

I really didn't know what I wanted so the nice barista talked me through some drinks and I ended up going with the Russian Tea (Earl Grey tea infused with apricot jam). It was unique tasting and good.\n\nI like how they have a little wagon to do some local deliveries. I also like their hanging menu. If I worked in downtown T-Dot, I'd definitely be frequenting this joint.", 4], ["I truly love this spot. The coffee is fantastic, the baked goods are divine, and the staff are really friendly.

They also have sandwiches, cold-pressed juices, and some other breakfast items.

They always make the time to look you in the eye and give you a smile, which is appreciated (especially in Queen West). \n\nThe only challenge with this spot is that it's a bit small and crampy in terms of seating and a lot of high-tops, rather than comfy chairs to cozy up in. There is a back patio as well which I haven't had the chance to explore, but hopefully I can check it out this summer.

Got a sun chai latte and a chocolate beef muffin. \n\nWhat I like about the muffin is that its super light and not sweet. You get a hint of sweetness from the occasional chocolate chips, but its not dense and caloric feeling like the typical bakery muffin.\n\nI am not a coffee person, but the latte was so good. Has a shot of espresso, you have that nice coffee aftertaste, and on top, it's so pretty!

There were also tons of wrapped up pastries and sweets (muffins, brownies, etc.) but not much in the way of a savory food menu. In fact, there is no food menu at all. There are simply a few pre-wrapped sandwiches to grab and go. \n\nAs for the \"best coffee ever,\" well, it was delicious. I got a 16 oz pour over that took about five minutes to make and wow. I drank it black and the flavor of it was thick and bitter and deep. I don't know how else to describe it. It really was good. \n\nThe staff was prompt and courteous, but they were also all business. No friendly small talk here. What's your order? Great, thank you. Go sit down, we'll bring it out. \n\nPrices were high. For my 16 oz pour over and one small hunk of a brownie it was $15 Canadian. \n\nSo they lost a star for price, as I think that's way outrageous.

I also got an iced macchiato with milk, lovely,  not to dark but Miley strong in taste.\n\nAs for a morning snack... I got their jam cookie today. Unsure if it's freshly baked but when I bit into it, not stale. The crunchiness is awesome as it isn't too crunchy but more so chewy. The jam in the middle is a bit tad sweet for me. \n\nI also got the walnut butter square. You definitely taste the walnuts, and the butter. I found this snack more sweet than the jam cookie. Personally, not for me. I'll save it when I have those sugar cravings. This will definitely fulfill it with one bite. \n\nAs for the setting, very hip, comfy, welcoming, just comfortable space with decent amount of chairs and tables to enjoy your coffee and treat. \n\nThe customer service was great.

As a casual coffee drinker, I couldn't tell you how this coffee was any different than most other coffee shops in the area.

Coffee offerings are generally of the varieties that would allow one to enjoy the pureness of the coffee beans... no fancy coffee foam art or gimmicky add on or copy cat matcha this and that... I got an Americano and it was simply good.  \n\nAside from that the egg on a toast was again simple but yet satisfying in a very wholesome way. I was skeptical at first because the appearance of the toast was kind  of meh...but once I took a bite I knew that they really care about the selection of ingredients... three year old cheddar, local farm raised eggs and homemade sour dough bread. The bread had the necessary crunch at the bottom and the bread was very good. If the egg could be a bit runny would of made the toast perfect. \n\nThere was also a little red wagon near the entrance with a sign that says we will delivery and cater within wagon distance.

They were crunchy, juicy from the pork inside and coated with a little bit of oil on the outside which added a nice flavour coating to the dumplings.\n\nAll in all I would definitely come here again on a rainy day and suggest this restaurant to all of my friends! 5/5 stars for the food and the staff were very nice to me and my girlfriend as well. No issues anywhere!", 5], ["Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! \n\nThe restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!\n\nWe ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!\n\nIf in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!", 5], ["Had a day to spend in Toronto and had heard many good things about Chinatown so off I went.  I was in the mood for dumplings and found the reviews to be good.  \n\nWas seated quickly and it was time to eat.  I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and Shanghai noodles and they were good.  I knew that the dumplings were going to be good when I saw them making them in the front window.   \n\nThis is a cool little restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall but has great food.  Service here was good and the food came out in a timely manner.   The noodles came out first and was surprised but then realized they are making the dumplings fresh in the window.  Good flavor in the noodles with lots of meat.   The dumplings came out and I was surprised with the number in the order.   \n\nAll in all food was good, service was on par and it was a good experience.  One word of warning is that they only take cash.", 4], ["Life just isn't the same after you have been to dumpling house.

So - my insights....  I wish I hadn't been so \"safe\" with my ordering.  I wish that instead of ordering the fried dumplings, which were delicious by the way, I wish I had ordered more of the steamed dumplings.  The were Uber authentico and seemed to have their own plump juiciness, with very clearly pronounced flavors.  The little guys were amazing.  My recommendation is to try the pork and chive- very very good!   \nAs far as being a great place for groups or kids, this place is a hole in the wall type of joint- the whole place is close quarters- but worth it.  The very moment you walk in, it is through an open kitchen with ladies at the window hand stuffing dumplings-  it's pretty sweet.", 5], ["As a self proclaimed dumpling snob where my mom's dumplings are 15/10, this place can settle for an 8/10. \n\nI'm honestly surprised by the less than stellar reviews. Sure, I've been skeptical of this place myself when I pass by it as I walk in Chinatown because I don't trust window displays of women making dumplings from scratch, but upon the chance of eating here, I would recommend you go just go here already. \n\nI ordered the steam dumplings and they tasted made to order! The skin (which I'm most concerned about) was not that thick and the filling was just right. It was a good skin to meat ratio if you know what I'm saying. \n\nI got the chive with pork which I really liked. Any chive dumplings- sign me up! If I'm craving some homemade dumplings, you bet i'll come here again!!", 4], ["Third time here, won't be back! I was eating with my partner and we were halfway through our noodles when she noticed a cockroach in her noodles.

The food is wonderful, fresh, and made to order. Highly recommended but I would advise going at off hours.", 4], ["Green onion pancake was bland. \nShanghai noodles were really sweet - not great, IMO. \n\nHowever, the pan fried pork and chive dumpling was WOW.

This place must be somewhere in the middle because no one had enough patience for us, but actually when we gave smiles we received a little smile back. I haven't talked yet about authenticity of food. I've been in Asian restaurants in the Toronto area where they treated us like intruders, but not this one. We needed some time to choose our food and we actually took it. Come on! We know time is money, but we really wanted to see what they actually offer. \nOur group had five people. They seated us at the table next to the wall and for sure, never again. It just doesn't work. It was too little space for five serving plates with the food we ordered, plus we wanted to share everything and it was just a mess.  It was actually my second visit here and the first time I wished they gave us a table not in the middle of the restaurant but next to the wall. Yeah, I wanted to be romantic. I think it is all about please come, order, eat and go. Faster better. \nAnyway... Food was great! We enjoyed every bit of it. We had two kinds of dumplings, fried pork and chive and steamed spinach and black mushrooms. We agreed our steamed choice was poor because it tasted bland and we actually didn't see any mushrooms in it. But you know what to do, dip it into some sauce you created and voila! Delicious! We also ordered Ma-Po's Tofu, Black Bean Beef and pork dish, not sure right now which one it was, but everything was very good. Beef was very tender, tofu in sauce extremely satisfying and pork also was nicely spiced and tasted just right. \nDefinitely will go back to have more dumplings and some of great looking noodles.", 5], ["Reliable, quick and tasty.

It was very packed with patrons even though it was just already almost 10 p.m. when we entered the restaurant.  We didn't have to wait for a table and got seated immediately.  We walked past the front kitchen area where there were a couple of ladies making fresh dumplings.  All of their dumpling orders seem to be freshly made to order.\n\nWe simply ordered two plates of dumplings to share.  We ordered the Pork & Chinese Cabbage Steamed Dumplings while S & S chose the Pork & Chive Steamed Dumplings.\n\nBoth steamed dumplings look the same (but you can see a slight hint of the green chives for the Pork & Chive one), but the taste was definitely different for each one.  The Pork & Chives one had a more obvious taste due to the chives.\n\nI liked the Pork & Chinese Cabbage one slightly more but both were just as delicious.  I liked how the steamed dumplings were full of stuffing and yet the dumpling skin was still smooth.  Most importantly, the dumpling skin wasn't too thick or starchy.\n\nDumpling House Restaurant also serves Pan Fried Dumplings too.  In addition, they have noodles, side dishes, rice, soups, and a lot more.  Their menu is very extensive!", 4], ["Very rude. \nMiddle of eating they requested us to move to another table so they can seat a bigger party.

I wouldn't mind paying in US cash but customer was being very thoughtful to a traveler. Employees should not be so rude. Looks really bad on the Chinese. It seems they only care about money.

It's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall and not as shiny attractive as other dumpling places, but don't be fooled--these are top-notch dumplings.  At the front when you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made by hand.  They and the other food are then cooked in the back.  It's a shotgun style building with a narrow entry way.\n\nWe had three types of steamed dumplings: the seafood, the pork and cabbage, and vegetarian.  Portions are huge.

Also I'm used to generally mediocre service from Asian places and don't care about indifferent servers but this place takes the cake. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in we were rushed through the entire meal. We had drinks which they asked us to consume outside. No problem, of course outside drinks are not allowed. I assured her we were not going to be drinking them inside. The waitress kept rushing us to order and also implied that we weren't ordering enough by asking if perhaps, we wanted to order another dish. She rushed us through the meal by constantly asking if we were done. It was not that busy that warranted this behaviour. Even if it were busy, hurrying us like that is extremely rude.  When we were finished she immediately came over and said \"you're done right?\" and handed us the bill. \n\nAs a result of her attitude, we did not leave a good tip.  My general rule is 10% for poor service, 15% for regular, 18-20% for excellent. She looked at the total we left and said \"oh actually $3 is 10%\" (we actually left below 10% because that's how incredibly bad her service was). Having had enough of her I said \"you haven't even given the type of service that warrants 10%, so why should you receive even that?\"  She replied that \"Actually, we don't do local Chinese business. We typically cater to non-Asian customers. If you don't like the service here, this is coming from me and the owner, no one says you have to come again.\"  \n\nYeah, don't worry I won't. \n\nAfter reading further reviews I can see that I'm not the only one to have experienced this rudeness.

I then said okay I understand which she then proceeded to yell 10% 10%. I said I already paid. She then says no for the tip. So I asked where is this written at? She says you are supposed to tip.

I said you chose to come yell at me when I only asked a question so no this wasn't good service and will not be tipping. She then yelled fine, don't come back!

If you are looking for an affordable meal, made fresh... Dumpling House is a great option. FYI I think the pork and chive dumplings were the best.\n\nWhy I prefer Mother Dumplings...\nI prefer their steamed dumplings. I find that the dough has more of a tooth to it. Like how pasta should be cooked. I also find that they have a larger selection of fillings, and they are more \"fun\" (creative). You can get pork and chive at both places, but only mothers dumplings has beef and chive. Dumpling House just has plain beef. Also, Mother Dumplings has a great whole wheat dumpling with pickled cabbage. When it comes to the green onion pancake, Mother's has more onion and flavour (although it is smaller).\n\nSo Dumpling House is totally worth checking out, but if you have one day in Toronto I'd recommend Mother's Dumplings instead.", 3], ["Shared an order of pork and chives dumpling (steamed, 15 pieces) and an order of Singapore fried noodles with the bf.

The only throw back to the original restaurant is the bathroom in the basement.\n\nIf you want some steamed Dumplings, there's no reason not to check out Dumpling house.  Not only are the dumplings great, but the dipping sauce you can create really gives it the extra kick.\n\nI suggest: 3 parts chili, 2 parts vinegar, 1 part soy.\n\nOn your way out, why not grab a Bahn Mi sandwich next door, and some Chinese buns from Ding Dongs across the street?", 5], ["Its a small spot which always get busy during lunch hours - due to acceptable taste & affordable prices.

For those of you who aren't familiar with this style of fried dumplings, they are very crispy on the bottom and perfectly steamed on the top.

While I've known of the place for a while, I decided to take my significant other to this place after consulting a list of the \"best instagram restaurants in Toronto.\" The staff were definitely above average - very nice, attentive. We visited on a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon for brunch. We had the FOCACCIA PORCHETTA and GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA. \n\nI have to say, pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes -- lucky me, because I was starving! I really enjoyed both meals. The only thing was that they had a little too much \"Rosemary\"? Was that what I was tasting? It was a bit overwhelming for me. I understand why the focaccia had rosemary -- although I would have preferred a bit more garlic. But why in the gnocchi alla romana? Anyway, I was starving, so I overlooked it. But next time, whatever I order, I'll ask that they take it easy on the rosemary -- or, just skip it all together! Maybe I'm allergic to rosemary! LOL", 3], ["The decor inside is gorgeous and they have a nice patio outside. They did a great job setting up the ambiance. \n\nWine is good. \n\nI've been 3 times so far and food has been quite mediocre overall. I've kept coming back to give it another try because I love the ambiance. Also they were new when I first tried. They're not new anymore. \n\nBrunch was nice. Dinner was only ok. Lunch definitely was disappointing though. The kale salad was so boring. Very light dressing, barely any flavour other than the toasted pumpkin seeds. The main course was disappointing. I got the branzino. It came with zucchini. The fish was not fresh, you could smell it. The all zucchini sides felt like leftovers. The dessert was cannoli. That was my first time trying cannoli, and if that's what it is, I never want another one in my life. How could it be so bland, it's deep fried with cheese? I know people who love cannoli, it can't be that that they love. \n\nCaprese was ok. It had some interesting tomatoes. The cheese on it was average. The margarita pizza was ok. They do thin crust. Seemed pretty standard as far as Italian pizza goes, so if you order that you will be less disappointed. \n\nMy guess is they skimp on the quality of the ingredients to increase their margins. Blandest cheese ever, fish was bad. \n\nThey had a $20 3-course menu for lunch and I still felt like it wasn't good value due to the low quality food. It didn't help that service was extremely slow. The restaurant was mostly empty, no reason for the service to be that slow. \n\nCan't say I'd come back on my lunch break considering the poor quality food and slow service. After work drinks maybe, but I'd eat elsewhere.", 3], ["Very flavourful menu items ! Loved the salmon and pickled zucchini vinaigrette .

It really is beautiful in there. The pink and gold risks looking like 1980s Miami, but Oretta somehow pulls it off.\n\nIt seems like other Yelpers have had mixed feelings about this place. I went for a celebratory dinner date and quite enjoyed it. Service was friendly, and our meals were delicious. We had the polenta, beet salad, and pizzas. It certainly wasn't my favourite pizza in the city, but it was quite good. You definitely also seem to pay for the flashy-ness, as well, but I am not surprised given the location.

High ceiling, modern fixtures, light, airy atmosphere. \n\nThe salad i got as an app was way too big to be an app. Even the server agreed! It was good and the pumpkin seeds added a nice, nutty crunch. I just couldn't finish it and too bad it was wasted.\n\nChicken was perfect. It was extremely juicy and seasoned right. The little bits of pomegranate to the rapini was a sweet, refreshing touch.", 4], ["Oretta just opened earlier this week.\nI was here Friday night for dinner and liked the food, service and atmosphere. The restaurant was fully booked for the evening and the only reservations available were for 5 and 6pm, however they will accept walk-ins on a first-come-first-served basis and there are no reservations at the bar. I was there at for my 6pm reservation and there were only a couple other people there and the dining room didn't start to fill up until almost 8pm.\nThe bistro-styled vaulted 2-storey space has a really nice feel with plenty of art deco touches and an impressive bar are dominating the center of the dining room. It feels comfortable, modern and not at all stuffy. I especially like that it is not a loud restaurant and you could comfortably have a conversation with others at your table without yelling, unlike many restaurants out there.\n\nI started with the Bison tartare which was nicely prepared and seasoned. The breaded soft boiled quail egg made for a nice creamy sauce for the tartare. For my main I had the Gnocchi with squash and healthy shavings of truffles which was really comforting and satisfying dish. I ended my meal with very nice zeppoli (a Italian doughnut), which was more crunchy and flaky than a typical zeppoli and filled with a light and a mildly-sweet chestnut cream filling. It's a nice dessert if you are not into sweets.\n\nMy meal was very reasonably priced, especially for King West (and considering Buca is across the street), and everything about it was great which is very impressive for a newly opened restaurant. I will definitely be back again!", 4], ["Orietta has been hiding something: it's gorgeous little cafe tucked away in the alley beside the main restaurant. With heaps of takeaway goodies like Italian baking, focaccia & panini sandwiches, spinach crostata, bomboloni and  pizza, they look poised to give Forno a run for their money. The coffee can be a tad bitter for my tastes and they don't offer cream, but they do serve almond milk and cold pressed juices. The real highlight here is the stunning space and the staff, who are exceptional. There's even a gorgeous event space upstairs you can rent out, and that they'll soon have open to patrons who need a quieter spot to work during the day. I'm sure the patio will be great in summer, too. A brilliant addition to the neighbourhood!", 5], ["Came here with a group of friends for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Place is very pretty just like the pictures with its pink and gold walls. Wasn't very busy though, maybe 1/3 full but service was pretty slow. I had the pancakes with pear ham and syrup which was okay. Large portion but slightly dry. Not a fan. My friends had the striploin with eggs which were pretty good.as well as the chicken breast and rapini. We ordered from the brunch menu so can't comment on other items. Overall a great place to hang out with friends, take pretty pictures, , eat some good food and experience friendly but slowwww service.", 3], ["Horrible experience. I went here for the summerlicious 3 course meal. I had read about the beautiful interior design of this place and it was indeed good, but not good enough to make up for the bland and dry chicken, tasteless pasta and mediocre at best dessert.

It was fairly crowded, so I would recommend making a reservation online. \n\nNote: We were not offered the complimentary bread until we noticed other tables getting them from their servers. So be sure to ask for it if you would like some and were not given any :)\n\nMAIN COURSE: Mezzi Paccheri de Mare (Squid ink pasta with seafood)\n\nThis was quite delicious! The squid ink itself has no flavour, but rather, it gives the pasta a unique black colour. The bay scallops and shrimp were very well seasoned; coupled with the buttery pasta sauce and tomatoes, which freshened up the dish, the thick pasta was a delight to eat! \n\nDESSERT: Chocolate brownie with ice cream and tart crumbs (I cannot find the name of the actual dish online nor do I remember it from last night, but this was essentially the crux of the dessert)\n\nThe brownie was very dense and creamy, perhaps too creamy for my liking, as it felt very heavy. Nevertheless, the blood orange sauce on top of the brownie was refreshing and delicious. The pistachio-like flavoured ice cream also had quite a unique and light taste, which complemented the almond/tart crust and dense brownie.", 3], ["My boyfriend and I went to Oretta for lunch last Sat. The place looks very posh, nice decor, etc. However, both Calabrese pizza and seafood pasta that we shared were average at best. The service was friendly though and the food arrived fast, even though the place was busy.", 3], ["Loved this place- everything from the interior design (Art Deco, cathedral ceilings, pastel colors) to the friendly service and hip uniforms.  The food was delicious also.  Will visit again soon.", 5], ["Great atmosphere and decor.  Was a bit too loud and found it hard to talk to my friends.  Service was ok, felt very rushed and the waitress kept clearing out plates without asking if we were finished, so our plates were taken away before really being finished.   Was a special 50th birthday and they didn't even give a complimentary piece of cake.  We were a group of 8, spent a lot of money and felt at least the birthday person should have had a complimentary dessert.  Food was pretty good , pizza was a bit wet in the centre though.  Salads were a very small portion for the cost.  Overall not bad, not over the top great though.", 4], ["My fave local haunt. Authentic Italian food. Fresh ingredients. Lovely deco and atmosphere.

We had the pizza, the carrot ravioli, the bolognese pasta which was recommended by the server and a salumi board to start. Overall it was just ok. Thankfully I saved space for the dessert cuz I knew it would be good. The chocolate torte with pistachio ice cream is my #1, the tiramisu was delicious to!!!!! So go for the desert!!!!", 4], ["Oretta just opened off King St and I'm extremely excited about it. I finally had the time to stop in their cafe in the back and was super impressed by the design and the quality of their Cappuccinos. \n\nI came in with a coworker through the entrance between King and Stewart and was served almost immediately. The host was really friendly and suggested we try a pistachio biscotti along with our orders, which was great. \n\nSuper colourful and really quick service. Only complaint was that there wasn't a menu in sight, this could be because Oretta is extremely new - but adding a menu or a little sign somewhere with bakery goods/drink options would be super helpful!", 4], ["Great place in terms of location, seating, environment. They allowed me to take lots of Instagram worthy pictures because of their cool decor. Friendly staff. Took our coats to hang. Ordered the margarita pizza. It was very hard, got cold quickly and not enough cheese. That was a bit disappointing. Still lots of other Italian options on the menu to try.", 4], ["Came with a group and tried several appetizers.  Fritto Misto was oily tasting and way too much reading.  Mozzarella Di Buffala was good and fresh, one of the top apps.  Polpette meatballs were good, but meat is a bit bland although sauce was good.  Insalata was a decent salad.  Cavoletti salad I enjoyed.  Nice dressing and serving size. Carciofi Tartufo, fried artichokes, too fried and didn't enjoy. \nHad the branzino as a main, substituted the pasta for the shaved artichoke.  The meal was well flavoured, although I asked for lemon as there wasn't any sauce.   The Florentina for $120 was over cooked and a bit chewy.  My friends actually sent it back.

There are so many better restaurants in this beautiful city of ours, don't waste your time on this one. \n\nMy three girlfriends and I had a reservation for 7 pm. The hostess was super friendly (and had great eyebrows!) and led us to a cute pink booth beside the bar. \n\nWe ordered a few drinks and appetizers to start the night off. We were laughing and having a great time, enjoying the food and drinks, when suddenly, the large, metal wall sconce above our heads falls out of its socket! We all jumped in fright! Thankfully, the sconce's power chord prevented the light from crashing into our heads, but needless to say, it was quite dangerous. \n\nThe staff apologized, the manager came by and apologized, and then quickly moved us to another table. They helpfully transferred our plates and drinks, albeit accidentally throwing out my friend's drink in the process. She then proceeds to order another one to replace it, and not one, not two, but three different people come by to clarify her one drink order to replace what another staff member inadvertently tossed out. Her drink arrived almost 30 minutes later; did they carve the ice by hand? What took so long? The restaurant was nearly empty.\n\nRegardless, we were fine, we were alive, no one was electrocuted, and so we laughed it off and continued our dinner. The manager even offered to get us a bottle of prosecco to apologize for having his resto's light fixture almost crack our skulls. \n\nNext issue: I ordered a second drink. The Rosso di Sera sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. It arrived, looked beautiful, and I went to take a sip, when I noticed a dead fruit fly floating in my drink! Ugh. Flagged down a staff member, told them about the fly, and they removed the drink while offering their apologies and simultaneously offered to get me another drink. I declined.\n\nThe rest of the evening progressed smoothly. We wanted to have a good night and genuinely enjoyed the food. The service, on the other hand, was deplorable. As we finished our meal, we were waiting for our server to come by and clear our plates, and offer us dessert and coffee. Standard resto procedure, right? Not for Oretta, apparently. \n\nWe sat around for a good 30 minutes, waiting for someone to come by. Our server did pass by our table a few times, but she didn't catch the arms we were waving in the air, nor the attempts to catch her eye, nor the polite \"excuse me\"s. This happened a few times. Mind you, she may have been busy or in the back on her break, fine. I get it. I worked in the restaurant industry all throughout university, so I understand that servers take a break when things are slow. But that doesn't mean you leave your tables unattended! What makes it worse is that the \"manager\" was just hanging out at the bar having dinner himself. You'd think the restaurant manager would notice a table of four looking around for their server, especially given the light fixture incident, but no, he didn't. \n\nWe order espressos and desserts to share. Drinks arrive, great. Two desserts arrive but we are waiting on the third. Assuming it will arrive shortly, the four of us proceed to enjoy our coffees and the desserts. About 15 minutes go by, and the affogato hasn't yet arrived. We try to flag down our server once more, and ONCE MORE, she is no where to be found. We get the attention of another staff member and inquire about the missing dessert. Another 20-30 minutes pass, and our server re-appears with the dessert in hand, and mumbled apology about the delay. The affogato was not what my friend had expected, but at this point, our collective patience had worn thin. We asked for the bill, paid, and left.", 1], ["While in Toronto for a long weekend, we went here tonight(Sat night in Sept) the food was mediocre at best.

The rewards for collecting tickets are kind of lacklustre when you do the math for how much you need to spend on tokens to play compared to simply purchasing the prize on Amazon. \n\nUltimately, this place is decent for a quick fun time.

A restaurant, arcade and lounge all rolled up into one location.  They do a decent job of it, but nothing truly excels to make you consider it over other businesses in either field.\n\nWe were invited by a family friend to celebrate a birthday at the Rec Room.  I've heard of the place and what it offered but never really had a chance to go until now.   \n\nThe Rec Room is located just across the Skydome (It will always be Skydome to me).  As such they don't have their own parking, which is sort of understandable considering it is downtown.  However, because of it's proximity to Skydome and Scotiabank arena, if there is a sporting event happening during the time you're there, expect the parking lots to jack up their prices a little/a lot.  The Leafs were playing the day we were there in the evening.  Luckily our party was for the afternoon.  The parking lot we chose was $12 until 6pm.  When we were leaving the prices were jacked up to $30 for the leaf game. Something to be aware of.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the Rec Room consist of 2 restaurants, an arcade and a lounge.  Our party was in the restaurant and arcade sections for the most part.\n\n- The restaurant:\nThe food for the most part was decent.  Expect to spend about $30 on food alone.  There's a kids menu at $12 which was probably the best value if you ask me.  The food gets the job done is the best way I can put it.  My wife got the salmon and as you can see from the pics, it's on the smaller side.\n\n- The arcade:\nI'm a gamer so the arcade part was the main attraction for me.  The arcade runs like a Playdium or Dave and Busters.  You purchase tokens on a card or wristband and you play the games using those tokens.  In terms of game selection, I found it a bit lacking here as a gamer.  There were far too many reward games that literally last less than 30 seconds.  They had about 10 true arcade games here that you could play with a group of friends at the same time.  The reward games also cost a lot token wise.  One of the kids at the party burned through 200 tokens (About $30) in less than 10 minutes.  I've gotten a whole days worth of fun on $30 at Playdium and Dave and Busters.\n\nThe best part of the Rec Room is the staff.  They were all friendly and super helpful throughout our visit.  They have a free coat check which is super convenient because of the kids.  Our waitress was amazing.  She was serving 2 other large tables as well as ours and she was on the ball all day.  She made our visit.\n\nThe Rec Room is a jack of all trades but unfortunately doesn't excel at any one thing.  If you're in the downtown core, it's worth a try.  I would make the trip to Playdium or Dave & Busters.", 3], ["Finally went to the Rec Room Downtown Toronto for my nephew's 6th birthday. My honest opinion overall it was...eh...okay. When we walked in the place looked big however when we finally got a chance to walk around the aisles were a little small and there weren't as many games as I hoped. However there was a large dinning area. We went for a Saturday lunch around 1:30ish. There was plenty of seating however we still had to wait for a seat. When were were seated we waited quite sometime to for our waiter to attend to us. It was a little disappointing seen as how there weren't a lot of people eating at that time. When we ordered our food, it again took quite some time to arrive. \n\nFor our lunch we ordered a Cobb Salad, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, Large Pretzel, Ceasar Salad, Salmon and Avocado Sandwich, Calamari and Stacked Taco Chips to share. The food was just okay. The best thing I enjoyed the most was the real large pieces of bacon in the salad....yummm it was delicious. Otherwise, nothing special about our food.\n\nI guess this is mainly just a place to have some drinks and chat.

It's so packed that it takes over an hour to get into the Rec Room and then you have to wait in huge lines to play random games. Don't even think about the basketball as you might have to wait an hour. The area is also really crowded that it might make you feel claustrophobic. \n\nI recently visited the rev room on a Sunday evening and it wasn't as busy. There were still lines to play each game but we did not have to wait an hour to load our game cards. \n\nThe Stage:\nRecently I discovered the Rec Room has a huge area in the back for private events. We came to the Rec Room to watch the magician illusionists and the back room is huge and so cute. They have European phone booths everywhere for photo opportunities and nice circular coaches surrounding coffee tables for large groups. It felt like a fancy lounge. I'd love to venture back to that room for more events. \n\nThe Parking:\nThere is one lot close to the Rec Room and it costs about $30 to park for the evening. We were shocked. I'd definitely suggest the TTC or parking further away and enjoying a nice stroll to the Rec Room. \n\nThe Restaurant:\nThe last time we tried to dine at the restaurant we waited the suggested hour and were then told it would be a few more hours. We were famished and went someplace else to eat. It's definitely difficult to get a table here over the weekend. \n\nThe Bars:\nThe drinks are good but pretty basic. They don't have too many fancy cocktails. I ordered the coco loco drink, which featured coconut water, tequila and some other ingredients and I found it to be really strong. \n\nSnacks:\nThey provide guests with free popcorn.

The fish and chips and burger were big hits at the table but the healthy options (we tried 3 of I think 4 salads) were very lack-lustre. Also, it was a bit busy and the service was crazy slow! Our server disappeared after dropping off menus and we had to get a busser's attention to go get her for us.

Aside from the complimentary popcorn, we ordered one pizza and a plate of popcorn chicken with chipotle sauce. I only had the pizza but I thought it was above the many pizzas you'd receive from an entertainment establishment - it had mozzarella cheese, arugula, sausage, and grilled bell peppers. \n\nBeing only a walk from the Scotiabank arena this is the place to be to watch a Toronto game if Jurassic park isn't your thing.

The food was decent. I had the classic burger with a salad. Hubby had the sliders & popcorn chicken. We shared a side order of fries. I liked all of the food except for the fries. The fries were subpar in my opinion. It's weird because I've been here once before for a work social event & the fries that time were delicious! The waitstaff seemed busy. Not sure if it's because of the company event going on. Our waitress was nice but she forgot the coffee that hubby ordered. At least we didn't get charged for it. \n\nAnyway the place was a bit busy as there was a company event being held. Plus all the random people there too. There was a good amount of large groups. We had to wait 15 mins for a table even though when we were seated there were still at least 3 empty tables that didn't seem to be reserved. \n\nAfter lunch there was a variety of games we tried. I liked the Kung Fu Panda game. We didn't have time to do the Star Wars VR game. So we'll have to come back to do that another time.

While there's multiple dining areas, a large dedicated game watching area and an arcade with a tickets rewards system it very well is like a grown up version of Chuck E Cheese.\n\nThe games are accessed via wristbands which are loaded near the main entrance with a variety of pricing for credits.  Games have different pricing so the Indy simulator takes something like 20 credits (equivalent to 5 bucks on the lowest plan) and some only take 5 or so.  Basically these coin up type games are all revenue connected via their pay system network so there's no actual money required at the games themselves, just the wristband swipe to deduct credits to play the games.  The games are quite contemporary as well.  Higher def screens, up to date games and the kind of games you won't see or play on a home console type system.  Other games of chance are the kind of games where an accumulation of tickets are traded for prizes at the redemption store.  Such prizes as Pops (the collectables), candy and other toys are available.\n\nThe food varies from sharable appetizers to sandwiches, pizzas and even entrees like steak etc.  The drink menu also has a variety of cocktails beyond just beer and wine.\n\nThe area we were seated in was an area near the back but to the side so we didn't have a view of the super large projection screen but we had our own little boardroom type table with a large screen.  The back side room had about 6 of these set ups.\n\nThe food was good.  I had ordered the 310 burger which was a double burger and I added cheese and bacon.  The fries were fresh cut.  I liked the food but it wasn't cheap but it certainly wasn't poor quality.  A 60oz pitcher of Goose Island was 26 which wasn't outrageously priced.\n\nI had a good time at the Rec Room and it's certainly a great place to have a get together especially it if involves game night for any sport.  Being that it was the Superbowl the place seemed to have Budweiser sponsoring the evening and they offered many free prizes and other promotional NFL items.", 4], ["The Rec Room is always a bittersweet experience. It brings a much needed \"thing to do\" to the Downtown Core. For those that don't know, it's basically Cineplex's version of Dave & Busters, but more corporate, and nicer.\n\nThe Rec Room is always packed, and it doesn't help that they squish all the games into a really tight midway. Seriously, there's no way for you to walk through the midway without bumping a kid or two. \n\nThe food is pricey, but decent. The complimentary Cineplex popcorn is a nice touch and always serves the role of an appetizer for me. Drinks aren't too bad either; in fact, my friend complained that our Rum and Cokes had 'too much' alcohol...usually, people complain that there's too much Coke!\n\nA pet peeve of mine, every time I come here, is that they seem to open and close coat check whenever they feel like it, even if there's plenty of room for more coats.", 3], ["Good atmosphere; especially if you are independent of the need to ask for help (from a staff member).\n\nGood ground-level patio.\n\nBeyond meat.", 4], ["Went here yesterday Saturday as part of our Toronto city adventure trip. We got there at 11pm and it was packed, they have decent games, almost everyone is playing, it's easy to bump into people because of the closeness of the arcades. \nThe cocktails are sooooo weak, I got a \"living my best life\" signature cocktail and I swear I didnt taste a drop of vodka, it just tasted like iced sugar juice. Same for my husband's drink he got one of the signature mules and it just tasted spicy. We paid $23 cad for both. \nWe werent able to go to the back where the dance floor would be. \nAll in all fun ambience, but probably wouldn't recommend drinking at at the bar unless youre getting beer, wine or shots.", 3], ["Really fun arcade/bar/restaurant right in the middle of everything touristy in downtown Toronto. It is a converted/reuse of old silos, which is totally great! You buy a wristband that is reloadable. The card attached can just be detached as it is not scannable at the games (an 8 yr old explained that to us when we had issues scanning). Haha! We were able to use the coat check to check our stroller for free. Super awesome to be able to drink decent wine and walk around while the kiddos play. We grabbed a pizza to go and it was wood fired and delicious.

I love Canadians!", 5], ["Coming from the states, this is kind of like Dave and Busters but better. The games were fun and there were multiple bars so getting a drink was easy.

We would definitely come back though.", 4], ["To sum up my experience, I wasn't satisfied with my food and was scolded by my server for 'not complaining earlier.' \n\nAll around disappointing food, service, and lack of games. \n\nLet me elaborate...\n1. Do NOT order the Rotisserie Chicken BLT. It comes complete with Ready Chrisp bacon, bland, dry, warmish chicken, and a thick soft bread to make you feel like you're getting bulk with your order. Honestly, the bread was the best part about this sandwich. Other friends also not impressed with their dishes. \n2. Not many games in the arcade area.\n3. Really slow service (can't tell if it's bad staff or bad management) \n\nI used to bartend and wait tables, so I know it can be frustrating when your understaffed and trying to keep up. I can also appreciate the natural speed bumps that come with a new restaurant fine tuning their operations. I really tried to give our server (and restaurant) the benefit of the doubt. \n\nI ate my sandwich anyway (big mistake) due to pure hunger, and asked our waitress to pass a message to the kitchen in hopes that they can avoid making this sandwich as horrible for the next victim. She responded by asking me, \"Well why didn't you tell me earlier?\" So I kindly let her know that no one had asked (servers are supposed to ask \"how's everything?\" within 2-3 minutes of receiving your plate), and that I was too hungry to wait for a replacement dish. She then says, \"But I came around and took your drink order.\" I was a bit stunned to be honest. She was quite defensive, but I had simply asked for a message to go to the kitchen; I hadn't asked for a refund, and I hadn't asked for another meal. After a brief conversation with our waitress and no apology, I gave up and let her continue with her evening.\n\nSo not only was my 17 dollar sandwich terrible, but I was scolded for 'not comaining earlier.'  Please don't go here. They don't deserve your business, and you don't deserve them either.", 1], ["This is great upscale place to hang out on a weekday or weekend. There's a lot of activities pool, ping pong, board games, arcade games, large screens to watch matches, VR (haven't tried that yet, it's an additional cost) and of course food/bar. It's good for group hangout. Lots of space to sit and enjoy. Can't cover everything in one day so makes it great for coming back. The food is a bit pricey but that's a given for such a space. The arcade games are based on tokens which you can top up via a bracelet. For $10 you can play quite a few games so that's good.", 4], ["TLDR: at first I was excited to be there. Now it's kinda just meh. Good for tourists that want to play some games after Ripley's or the CN Tower.\n\nI went on the 2nd day they were open. I went again last night. When I first went there it was exciting and new. There were big crowds and it was fun. Grab a drink. Play a new game. Wait for a shooting game behind a group of guys in suits. Grab a drink. Play an oversized app game. Wait for a racer behind a few kids on a double date. Repeat. The food was moderate but good. \n\nThis time the place was pretty empty. The excitement of a new place was gone. The energy of a lot of people was nonexistent. I feel like there were less than two dozen customers playing games, which feels empty in a place that big. This sounds like it'd be fun, because there were no line ups, but it kind of got old fast. \n\nIt was just a lot of noise without the excitement. Like being at a music festival where there weren't many people. You could see it influencing the employees too. The whole atmosphere was lacklustre. Very, as my brother would put it, \"meh.\" \n\nIf you want to play some arcade games and drink, and you're already downtown, go for it. If you're a tourist I'd upgrade my rating to 3/5 if you combo it up with attractions in the area. I'll probably go again, but only with a group where we all bring our own gamer, nerd, competitive energy. So probably not a great date spot for me, cause I'll go to win. I want people leaving with a grudge like a good game of monopoly. Ha. But ya, I won't rely on the energy of the place itself. \n\nFYI I got the reusable band with 200 credits but we didn't even use half before we got bored and just drank", 2], ["This would be my second visit to the The Rec Room.  I had a horrible experience the first time.  This time around there were some issues as well.  \n\nMy first visit was when they were only opened up for business within the first month. We got there and there was a huge line up for the Rec room job fair right in the middle of the dining room while we ate.  It was so distracting.  Also we had a new waitress that messed up my order three times and on the third attempt still got the wrong order.  At the end i gave up and was starving while my clients were eating so I just ate what they gave me.  When I got back to the office I ended up having a stomach ache from food positioning of under cooked salmon. I swore I would never go back.  I would give them a 1 star on yelp then if i did the review then.\n\nThis time I decided to give The Rec Room another shot since a lot of my friend never been and it's a huge entertainment complex.  Plus I was over 5 months since I was there last.  I was thinking even if I don't eat I can drink and have fun.  I have to admit The Rec Room is very impressive. It's like a more expensive and classy version of Dave and Buster. I made reservations 2 weeks in advance for a table of 20 people. My friend and I got there and I was told they needed 75% of the people to be present in order for us to even be seated. Which was stupid since the entire place was empty at 4:30 pm in the afternoon.   My friend got mad and spoke to the manager and told him it was my Birthday then they reluctantly gave us the table and told us we had to leave by 7:30 pm. I never had that request made before for such a large party and especially if not all of us could come at the same time! All the reasons why I did not want to be there came right back. But I pushed it aside. We got our drinks and food orders. I got hungry and to be safe i ordered the chicken Ceasar salad. The portion was tiny almost like a side salad with a few pieces of grilled chicken and it cost me $19!!!! Food is pricy!! Even my boyfriend got the burger and fries and the portion of the fries are so little unlike other pubs.  The service was better this time and they gave us separate bills which was great. So they improved by getting an extra star. However the food is still bland and expensive for a pub. Also the way they handle the seating situations already left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if I would comeback for food.  But I do have some leftover money on my game card so I might come back for a couple of drinks and finish up my game card.   Very disappointing since the place is gorgeous!", 2], ["Our experience at the Rec Room was lacklustre. We came in around 7:30 and asked for a table, and we were told it would take about 45 minutes to have the table ready. We went back an hour later and were told it would take 15 minutes since they were cleaning. When we went back after the 15 minutes, we were told it would take 20 more minutes because they were STILL cleaning the tables. \n\nThere seemed to be plenty available tables, but none of them were being cleaned, as it appeared there were more security guards at the Rec Room rather than servers waiting and cleaning up tables. Around 9:00pm we decided that we would leave, but as soon as we were about to cancel, we were finally seated. Personally, I feel that my party and I were not seated fast enough due to not being taken seriously, as we were a bit younger than the others at this establishment.\n\nOnce we were seated, there were still a lot of empty tables but they were left dirty. One table near us was dirty for the majority of our dinner until it was somewhat cleaned.\n\nThe redeeming quality was that it didn't take too long to get our food after waiting over an hour and a half for our table. The pizza and burgers were average at best. The wristbands for the games were very efficient and there were some really fun games, but the selection was a bit limited.\n\nIn all, I don't plan on returning, and would much rather go to Dave and Busters for a better experience.", 2], ["The Killer B's of the Rec Room:\n\nBiceps/Boobs/Botox/Big Lines\n\nWent here on a Saturday for a birthday and left with mixed feelings. On one hand, the building itself is gorgeous and the food is pretty good, on the other hand, the games area was way too packed! But more on that later...\n\nFirst, we sit down for dinner (which was good), with a table to our right full of eight no-neck, roided out juice monkeys with 6 foot wide backs that caused their balloon arms to be lifted up and hang awkwardly like a scarecrow pinned to wood posts... to our left is a group of three ladies, each one older than the next, and each one with larger more Botox and filler inflated lips than the next. The oldest one looked like a duck who had its beak run over by a transport truck. \n\nAfter dinner, we checked out the games section  and here I saw more exposed tween breasts than the back of Nick Carter's tour bus in the early 2000's. \n\nBottom line, pretty cool, decent place, but it was way too packed on a Saturday with some odd characters. Will come back after a ball game in the summer.", 2], ["Amazing time. We got in and immediately got our coat checks done. Then we went to the center bar and ordered drinks. After a few, we got tickets and walker around The Yard and played a few games. Enjoyed the vibe a lot, fun spot", 5], ["Came here for the very first time on a Thursday evening afterwork at around 7pm with my cousins. Not much luck with finding free parking in the area, so we ended up parking in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (South Building) parking lot. The entrance to the parking lot is on Lower Simcoe St. To get to The Rec Room there's an exit that takes you directly to Bremner Boulevard which is about a 1 minute walk to the door of The Rec Room. \n\nWalked in to be greeted by 2 separate reception areas. The first one was for purchasing your credits to play in the arcade and the second one was for the dining area (I think). You can use your Scene points or pay to purchase credits used to play the games. These credits are loaded onto a small keycard that gives you access to the machines. 1000 Scene points can get you $10 worth of credits. Each game in the arcade charges a different number of credits for you to play. \n\nMy visit to The Rec Room was solely to play at the arcade so I won't be commenting on the food and drinks. There are 2 restaurants located within this facility, a bar with big screens for sports fans to enjoy a drink while cheering for their favourite sports teams, and the arcade area which is accessible to all. My first impressions of this place after walking in was that it was hectic and a bit disorganized. Although the dining areas were sectioned off, all you can see were people walking around with drinks in their hands, people watching people play, or people lining up to play. For an arcade, I wouldn't say they had a huge selection of games to play, but there were obviously some more popular ones than others like shooting hoops, Mario Kart and air hockey. The line ups to play these games will eventually discourage people from wanting to  play. If you have younger children, I don't think this place is suitable for them as it's not very kid friendly. The idea of being allowed to drink while gaming sounds exciting and fun, but in reality, it's just stupid. There's enough people walking and standing around as it is, we don't need drinks to be spilled too. \n\nDon't think I'd be returning to play games, but I'll probably give the food a try.", 3], ["They did a good job with the ambiance if you're into Entertainment overstimulation. The place has a lot going on and is good for kids. The food is very average and the server was very slow to take Our orders.

Website make the place seem more than it is. They are much smaller than Dave and Buster's with a small selection of arcade games.

The one person didn't charge me for the nascar simulator that costs 20 credits and then when I was garbage and kept crashing the person had a lot of patience with me. There was the Star Wars Virtual Reality (which wasn't involved with the game pass payment) and it was really fun! You are a stormtrooper and you have to obtain something that could destroy the galaxy I may sound stupid when I say this but when we were traveling over the lava on some platform I felt like if I walked over the edge I would fall into the lava.

It was crazy packed at 8pm but no lineup to get in, as this does happen later on. The wait to get a table was impossible, and the gaming area was insane. I didn't like the layout of where the gaming area and bar was, as it felt too claustrophobic. I was sad I couldn't play any games, as I loveeee to do that. The drinks were really good, especially the rec room mule, made with whiskey. They had enough bartenders to cater to the crowd, which was hectic due to the argos, raps, and leafs all playing that day. We found a back room, which had a lounge type feel. We were able to get couches and food. The pizza and buffalo chicken were absolutely delicious. I love ricotta on my pizza! The prices were pretty reasonable. They also gave free popcorn at the bar.

Then I remembered that The Rec Room had opened recently and thought it might be a fun night out. \n\nWe each bought 30 dollars worth of \"tokens\" (which are added to a digital bracelet so you're not actually lugging any physical tokens around, how times have changed!) and were told that it would probably last us about two hours. Spoiler alert: it did. In fact, I was trying to find ways to use up my tokens by the end (the Photo Booth was a good way to use them up). \n\nWhich brings me to one of the bigger downsides: the lack of variety. Yes, it was super fun to get to play the arcade games, but the fact is there really aren't *that* many to choose from, and after the first hour you're kind of grasping for ways to kill tokens.\n\nThe types of games are basically split into two categories: skill games that give you \"tickets\" that you can redeem for prizes (think Ski-Ball, Hoops shooting, etc.) and pure arcade games that do not result in tickets (your Alien shooters, your racing games, etc.). There's also a \"third\" tier which are the \"jackpot\" type \"games\" which are really nothing more than you feeding tokens in hope that you hit the jackpot and win a bunch of tickets. It *can* be done - my one cousin ended up scoring almost 500 on one \"spin the wheel\" game - but chances are you're just going to burn a bunch of tokens real quick. \n\nIn other words, with most games costing between 6-8 tokens you could be hard pressed to actually spend them all and not get tired of playing the same few games over and over again. \n\nThere's also some pinball machines (including a beautiful Ghostbusters themed one) and in the back traditional bar games (like pool, though we didn't try these out). There's also a VR experience called \"THE VOID\" which costs ~$30 extra and requires a reservation but we didn't try it out. It looked cool, but I can't imagine it's worth the huge added cost. To be honest, the place is so huge there might have been more stuff we were missing, but it seemed that the arcade games were in one main, rather smallish section.\n\nWhile $30/person isn't the most expensive night out, things could definitely be improved by adding a larger variety of games, and more of them. But in terms of a fun night out with out-of-towners, it was a big success.\n\nThey also have a restaurant called three10 which we had dinner at before digging into the games. It offers your standard sort of \"bar & grill\" fare (think burgers, steaks, wraps, etc). The food itself isn't great, and you're definitely paying a premium. For three people (including drinks) our bill was over $100 and you can easily get a *much* better meal for less in the city, so you're better to stick to just the games here, and avoid the food. Though the Popcorn appetizer (this is a Cineplex owned joint after all) was a nice touch!", 4], ["This place is brand new and set to be quite a staple in Toronto. Seconds away from the CN tower, Rogers Center (Skydome if you're old like me) and ACC.

Great place for small and large groups, highly entertaining environment with sports on TV, arcade gaming and active gaming options, for a cheap price of about $10-20. Recommend the food, it's delicious...cheese spinach dip is chunky and full of flavour, the calamari is on the smaller side of things but very delicious and comes with a couple of rich tasting dipping sauces. The pizzas are highly recommended as they have a Italian wood oven recipe, very classic. The rib eye steak with coleslaw and fries is what I had for an entree and it was perfect...medium rare was done to perfection. The service here is superb! Attentive, quick and courteous!

One of the trips here we ordered two double vodka soda waters and was charged $44 CAD. At first we thought okay a single vodka soda is $11 CAD then but when we went back for our second round (we got a different bartender) our two single vodka sodas only came out to $18 CAD. Not the biggest ordeal but considering that the bartender that charged us the first time ($44 CAD) was a bit rude and obnoxious it did leave a bad taste in our mouth. \n\nBut some of the positives are they have a good amount of TV's near the bar and was very happy to see them playing American Football. Also, they have a lot of fun games ranging from racing, shooting, beer pong, etc. This is a good place to stop by if you're just trying to kill some time and aren't really looking for anything spectacular. \n\nI cannot comment on the food mainly because they didn't have many vegan options and when we asked the bartender about vegan options he told us to just look at the menu.", 3], ["Do you really come here for the food?

Typically this is a street food that resembles a schwarma, but I believe tasty in its own way! The bread that wraps your meat and veggies, was slightly thicker and held well together. This place is located in Kensington Market in Toronto. They have posted hours and are typically open for lunch and dinner. I arrived as soon as they opened and a line had already formed. They have more than just d\u00f6ners to choose from. However, since I'd been on the lookout I had to get one. They have options for different sauces and ask if you would like one, two, or, all three. I chose all three. At first bite, got a hint of spice, creaminess of the sauce, and crunchy vegetables. Everything combined was incredible. Since I don't live nearby, I definitely look forward to returning next time I'm in Toronto!", 5], ["Amazing vegetarian halloumi doner! This place really makes you appreciate Berlin style donner. One bad note is the bathroom is horrendous. Like a bad gas station. But the food is amazing.", 5], ["Otto's Berlin D\u00f6ner was a small restaurant with a hipstery kind of vibe.  It was a smart causal service where you ordered and paid for your food and could eat in or take out.  In fact, we saw a lot of takeout orders during the time that we were there.\n\nWe ordered the Veal & Lamb D\u00f6ner.  (When I saw the photos on Google maps, I didn't realize what I wanted to try was their sandwich!  It certainly didn't look like it. XD  I had to ask the staff to confirm.)\n\nThey had a self-service water station.  They also had beer from a tap and wine.  It was a very popular place with lots of customers dining in on a Friday night.\n\nThe Veal & Lamb D\u00f6ner sandwich was gigantic and so worth it and filling for one person to eat.  It was bigger than the size of my face!  It was loaded with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, red cabbage, onions, hot sauce, garlic aioli, yogurt herb, and fresh leaf lettuce.  The pita bread was sooo good!  Despite it having so many ingredients in it, it held up very well and was easy to eat with your hands.  I especially liked the garlic aioli smeared generously on the pita bread.\n\nThe saucy meat was even tastier as you got to the bottom of the sandwich and it was definitely the kind of thing I crave for sometimes.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant!!", 5], ["I know it doesn't look like much from the photo but daaauuuunm it was amazing. \nOtto's doner is a place I've been trying to get to forever. I got the chicken on salad box and my friend of the fried halloumi on fries. Both we're really good. Super garlicky so keep that in mind if you have plans after eating there. I want to go back. Right. Now. \nI've been thinking about that halloumi since Saturday. \n\nPro tip:\nUse the bathroom and hit the big button. IT'S A DISCO BATHROOM!!!!!", 5], ["I've been here several times before, and have always enjoyed my food! Most recently, I ordered a large chicken teller (box) with garlic aioli sauce, and  had half fries, half house salad for the side.

They have a fun washroom, so check that out too if you have time.", 4], ["Place was full at dinnertime so we sat outside in the patio area. I can imagine this place to be an amazing destination in the summer when it's warmer out. \n\nSplit a curry bratwurst, which was highly recommended by my coworker and it was fantastic. Good amount of curry and crispy fries. Also ordered a shandy to go with the fries. They have a decent selection of German beer here as well. \n\nOrder and pay at the front. Grab the food once it's ready.", 4], ["I'm a huge fan of Otto's and have been coming weekly since they opened back in 2015. Their d\u00f6ner sandwich (a variation of a Turkish sandwich but filled with chicken, veal or lamb) is divine and bound to satisfy your hunger. \n\nMy go-to is the chicken d\u00f6ner with lots of sauce, but you really can't go far wrong here. They also have lamb/veal sandwiches, halloumi for vegetarians and currywurst with a delicious tomato-based curry sauce. \n\nAll sandwiches can be dressed up with fries and feta cheese for an upcharge, but I honestly find them just fine as-is. \n\nOne of the big plus points for me is that they use Ritual and Uber Eats for online ordering, so there's no real reason to wait in line. \n\nDuring the summer they have an outdoor patio which is great, and their beer selection is extensive and very reasonably priced. \n\nAt around $11 plus tax for a sandwich and $11-14 for a teller box it's not exactly cheap, but I've never left hungry. Keep an eye out for occasional Ritual perks for a discount on your first mobile order.", 5], ["I had the chicken box with salad. Very tasty. Not bad quantity, I would of appreciated more chicken tho. 4 stars because it tasted excellent and was quick.

I understand it's downtown but for the portion and the taste certainly found it a bit overpriced. \n\nOtto has a self serve system where you pay and wait for your order. Seats are limited but they do open up the patio. I got the chicken bowl doner. Its pretty typical sauce salad chicken. Honestly not much to write home about it was 12 for a small bowl. I was disappointed but the food did taste good again not very unique you can get this type of food for bigger portion elsewhere.", 2], ["This place is nestled in Kensington market and is busy throughout the day. I ordered through Ritual at 2:30pm to avoid the line, which was ~10min just to order. \n\nThe ambience is casual and well-decorated. The place is always busy, but the turnover for tables was fairly quick. I had the lamb and veal D\u00f6ner with all the sauces. The combination of the sauces mixed well with the seasoning, giving it a savoury and spicy flavour similar to that of shawarma (I understand that D\u00f6ner has some Turkish roots, if I'm not mistaken!). \n\nIt was a bit pricey for the portion (~$15 excluding tips), but all my friends that had chicken or lamb teller seemed really satisfied, so I think I'll return and give that a try. Overall, I'd come back! Food was solid.", 4], ["We were just looking to try some new food when a local bakery owner recommended this place. Great food!

It's a German styled street food restaurant specializing is sandwiches and beer. \n\nThe Doner is like a Greek Gyro, it contains think, juicy slices of spit-roasted, chicken, veal or lamb. You can order them on a pita or in a box. The meat is tossed with fresh tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce and red cabbage, then doused with a spicy, garlicky yogurt sauce. If you like spicy foods, ask for the hot sauce. It's a slow burning, I believe cumin based. \n\nThey also have a halloumi Doner, which is a fried salty cheese w/ feta in a pita or box, and their currywurst and fries. \n\nOn tap or bottles, you can find nine German brews, including a Schwarzbier. \n\nIt's a great cheap eat in Kensington!", 4], ["The food is great.

I usually go to Otto's once a month because I love the food but the service has extremely declined. For starters, the cashier's never seem like they want to be there and when you arrive they don't take your order right away. Instead, they linger around, look at you and continue doing what they were doing as if they can't take five minutes to say \"How may I help you?\" \"What would you like to order?\". Instead, blank stares. This is unfortunate because the food is lovely but it's not my first choice when I go to eat in Kesington market.", 3], ["SO GOOD. Nothing I've ever had before but it was so filling and sooo tasty. I got it with chicken and my boyfriend got it with lamb with all possible toppings.

I missed the delicious bread that accompanied the tasty chicken.", 5], ["The Brat and the fried Halloumi  were ok but nothing special...fries were soggy, the \"homemade curry sauce\" was vinegary, the only alcohol free beer was wheat beer...this would never fly in Deutschland so I don't recommend looking for authenticity.", 2], ["Otto's sells Turkish German fusion in Kensington Market. You can get kebobs, curry-wurst, and a German beer here. Prices are a decent as beer comes in a half liter and portions are generous.

If you end up using the WC, go and hit the buttons on the way for a good time ;)... it's music and disco you sickos!\n\nOrdered:\nCurrywurst - plenty of fries, one large banger and seasoning on it. Fairly tasty, good amount of curry\nMunich Gold - very light, crisp. Step up from coors.", 4], ["Nice vibe. Food came out pretty quickly and was nice and hot. D\u00f6ner is not the easiest thing to eat, but friends said they enjoyed it quite a bit. A large teller box is definitely large.

Will come again to try the teller box with couscous", 5], ["If you're in Kensington Market and need a washroom break, you must stop by Otto's Berlin Doner. They have two single toilet washrooms that sport speakers, a disco ball and strobe lights. The party starts when you push the large colored button on the wall.

Yes I visited both bathrooms and pushed the button a couple of times LOL!\n\nNow don't forget to purchase something for the use of their washroom, remember they don't have to allow you to use it if you're not a customer.

They were doing a good business but there are still seats available for us to be comfortable.\n\nWe both ordered the chicken teller box with halloumi, half fries, half salad, and a mixture of all the sauces. They had a can of cider which went really well with the spices in the sauces. The refreshing cider balanced out the medium-level spice. It was the perfect level of spice for me. They also have a very nice large selection of unique beers. The small box option was more than enough food for myself, though my friend chose the large box option.\n\nIf you're in the area you should definitely do yourself a favour and stop by for some tasty eats.", 4], ["First time trying D\u00f6ner.

The atmosphere was welcoming, loved the decor on the walls and the place was warm. Maybe a bit too warm later as I sat beside an old heating system for the building. \n\nThey had a lunch special of a 3-course meal for $25. I was disappointed that they only had one choice for their daily dessert. So I opted/sub it for a Turkish tea. \n\nThe tea was presented nicely in a small glass which I would have liked a bigger amount of tea.

I liked the red cabbage one the most. \n\nMy partner's chicken dish was made with tomato sauce and nothing stood out to him, beside that the chicken was also dry. Good thing there was a sauce to it.

I wish I had someone to share the veggie mixed platter with too, it looked really good and I love vine leaves.\n\nWhen my plate arrived, it looked great!  The kebobs were fragrant and the salad was nice and colorful with shredded beets and carrots.  The mixed platter ($18.95) had juicy chicken kebob and spiced beef and lamb which I smothered in garlicy yogurt.  \n\nI'm sure I'll be back some time!\nEarlier in the evening so I can have a Turkish coffee and not stay up all night.", 3], ["I was travelling on business in Ontario and decided to explore the area for dinner instead of doing the easy  but boring activity of eating dinner at my hotel.  Anatolia --- I'm so happy that I found you and that people were spot-on in describing you - what a wonderful little place!  \n\nAnatolia is deserving of its 5-star ratings.  Anatolia is quaint and inviting, and the service is friendly and prompt.  The warm, welcoming ambience is a feature I like when visiting family-owned restaurants versus big-chain franchises.  I was very pleased with my dinner selection -- everything I had was superb.  It was presented nicely (see photos) and tasted fantastic.  I had the mixed veggie plate.  It consisted of an array of food: stuffed artichoke, stuffed grape leaves, white bean salad, and deep-fried phylo-wrapped feta.  Entrees are also served with hummus and freshly baked Turkish \"pide\" bread.  \n\nTo end my meal, I had a Turkish coffee served with a morsel of Turkish delight.  The Turkish coffee can be made sweet, medium, or strong.  It is served in a small teacup about the size of a double-shot espresso.  Turkish coffee is thick and contains coffee particles.  You drink the liquid portion as best you can and leave the solids behind, swirling the particles along the side and bottom of your cup.  The waitress said you can supposedly read your fortune, based on the coffee pattern in your cup - kinda like reading tea leaves, I guess.\n\nMy business trip did not leave me much time to explore Toronto, but this meal was, by far, the highlight and most enjoyable part of my trip.  On certain nights, Anatolia serves a prix fixe menu and offers live belly dancing performances.  Also, if you ask for one of their take-out menus, there's a 10% off coupon inside the menu.  Anatolia is delightful, and the locals are lucky to have this little treasure in their neighborhood.", 5], ["Wow! What a meal! It was our first time at Anatolia and I only wish we discovered this place sooner.\n\nWe went on a Sunday night and the place was about half full. It seemed like most patrons were regulars. We were greeted quickly but then were shuffled to several tables so we could pick our own seat. It was a little awkward.\n\nWe started with the feta and hummus appetizer. It was some of the best, freshest feta I've ever had.\n\nWe then shared the massive meat (kebab) platter. All of the meat was piping hot and cooked to perfection. It was served on barley and basmati rice and had two amazing dipping sauces.\n\nAnatolia we will be back again and again!", 5], ["This restaurant made me fall in love with Turkish food. Order the gozleme as an appetizer it's a thin dough with cheese and onions. So good! The mezze dips are yummy I love the walnut spread. Adana kebabs or the beyti are also must order items. I even love the rice they serve with most dishes and I'm not a fan of rice. It is a little expensive but the quality is there. Also don't forget to make reservations on the weekends you can't just walk in and expect a table we've been turned away a couple of times.", 5], ["The first time I had Turkish food was at Anatolia. I didn't know what to expect so I asked the server for some recommendations. Everything she recommended was so delicious and well made. You could tell they really care about providing only the freshest and high quality food. The atmosphere is warm and lively and I really enjoyed my overall dining experience. The service was top notch as well. I recommend everyone try Turkish food at least once in their lifetime and if they're in the west end, they gotta eat here.", 4], ["This place is soooo GOOD!  The food quality is SUPERB. I've been here twice and both times I have been blown away. I can't wait to go back and try other things. It's a family run, fine dining experience.

This place is a gem.", 5], ["This place has the best Turkish food in the GTA, and we come here once in a while for lunch or dinner -- if you're only two people, you can almost always get a table without reservations. On weekends they tend to have large celebrating groups and get too loud for a date night.\nThe Meze Tabagi appetizer plate (four appetizer spreads) is a must, so you might want to just split one entree after that, unless you're big eaters. One of the items on that plate, a walnut spread, is very special and memorable. The chicken kebabs and beef kebabs are both well marinated, succulent, and made with great quality meat. The kofte, however, made from ground meat (beef and lamb) are quite bland and made with moderate-quality meat, and I wouldn't recommend. Don't get the shrimp dish, either (why are you coming to a Turkish restaurant to get sauteed shrimp anyway?). I'm taking a star down for these (very few) missed dishes and also for the fact that their wines by the glass are so-so.", 4], ["I ate at this restaurant multiple times, each time the food was amazing, delicious and clean.

The owners are really lovely and passionate.  The food is fantastic, really fresh and authentic. If you ask them for recommendations you'll see how passionate they are about the food.", 5], ["My first ever run-in with Turkish cuisine was when I was in Grade 4 in Mr. Wills' homeroom class.  He was my English teacher and we had read C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  After we finished reading the book, Mr. Wills bought Cadbury's Turkish Delight in for the class as we all were wondering what heavenly deliciousness could make a brother betray his own blood?  Well, I later found out that it was nothing but a pinkish looking jujube-like candy covered in chocolate.  I guess you can't really consider that to be a sampling of any culture's cuisine.\n\nWhile exchanging emails with my mom about how all the good bakeries in Scarborough reside along Kingston Road, she must've stumbled upon a connected link to other bakeries which led her to Ma Maison, which was inconveniently located at the polar opposite end of the Scarborough bakeries I was referring he to - Ma Maison was in Etobicoke.  Since my mother wanted to try their croissants, and since I was going to be in Etobicoke anyways, I decided to go outside my comfort \"zone\" (literally), and try Turkish cuisine.  Yelp has always brought me to new and exciting restaurants that I would otherwise not discover or even think about trying... Anatolia fell right into that category.\n\nI arrived at approximately 5:45PM on a Wednesday to an empty restaurant.  There were about 5 tables at the peak (while I was there).  There were 2 servers.  The decor was traditional with lots of Turkish chinaware lining the walls and tapestries.  Red-and-white-checkered table cloths were laid across the table.  \n\nBeing inexperienced, other than having read reviews about the Mixed Plate being good, we asked the server for her recommendations for an appetizer.  None of us were particularly hungry, so we just got one mixed plate and ended up opting for the quartet of dips/spreads.  This is also the first time I've been to a restaurant where I was uncomfortable trying to pronounce the names of the dishes in fear of sounding like an idiot, haha.  So I just said, I'll take a number 16 and a number 35.  I bet I challenged the server's memory! \n\nMeze Tabagi-  Four of Anatolia's most popular spreads including: Ayse's Walnut Spread, Hummus, Salsa and Eggplant.  Other than the walnut spread, I found the other 3 spreads to be rather bland and unflavourful.  I will say though that all the spreads tasted fresh.  The bread that came with the dips was different than western breads.  It almost reminded me of eating a water biscuit as it was quite simple in terms of flavour, but I wouldn't use the word bland to describe it.    \n\nAnatolia Mixed Plate - Came with 1 grilled chicken kebab, flame broiled beef kofte, lahmacun (a crepe-pita hybrid filled with ground beef, and various Turkish spices), bulgur rice and a rice pilaf.  The grilled chicken was quite tender, juicy and succulent and the yogurt dip was rich and creamy.  The beef kofte's had a nice char to them and were also quite flavourful.  I loved the rice pilaf that was cooked in a chicken broth but the winner of this mixed plate had to be the lahmacun.  The lahmacun was wrapped into a cigar shape, and had so many different layers of flavours that just came together to create a tasty, tasty \"crepe.\"\n\nTo end the night off, I tried a Turkish Coffee.  It took about 15 minutes from the time I ordered it to show up on the table.  Turkish Coffee comes in an espresso cup and a piece of Turkish delight.  I had originally ordered it strong and sugarless (I was thinking Starbucks coffee) but when the server gave quipped \"Are you sure?\" I took her recommendation and went with medium instead.  It was later revealed to me that Turkish coffee is quite strong.  I guess that's why you need the Turkish delight as an accompaniment.  Turkish Coffee in my own words, tastes rather \"woody.\"  It does not possess a particularly strong caffeine flavour to it, but is unique in its own right.  Just a heads up that there will be coffee grinds at the bottom of your cup, try to avoid drinking that!  The Turkish delight was a lot better than the Cadbury version that I had back in primary school, and had nuts in it.  \n\nVerdict:\n\nI must reward top marks when it came to plating and presentation.  Everything was so visually appealing, not to mention savoury.  The Mixed Plate is definitely a must try as all the proteins were juicy, succulent and tender with a nice char/grilled flavour to it and the rices were flavourful as well.  The bill fell shy of $50 with tax and tip.", 3], ["Nice atmosphere. Very tasty food although many things from menu made from same ground beef and fancy Middle East name chosen to give the impression of variety when a different sauce or presentation  added.

A group of friends and I went for the Night of Istanbul, when they have prix fix dinner and a night full of entertainment.  The dinner was absolutely delicious, the atmosphere was nice, cozy (as it is not a big restaurant by any means).  The entertainment was then fantastic, they had a lovely live band (duet?) for part of the night and the other part of the night was a bellydancing show.  I was impressed with the dancer, she was beautiful, very skilled, elegant, and fun.  I am a dance aficionado and I enjoy a good bellydancing show.  Having travelled quite a bit and having seen (too) many bellydance shows in my life I could tell this dancer was very good and professional, her name was Maha (or Maya or something like that, we asked as we were considering hiring a bellydancer for a party that year).  \n\nAnyways.  Years pass and we finally got to go again with some friends, we made the reservation for the Night of Istanbul of course hoping for a great entertainment/show like we had had before.  What a disappointment....  the 'dancer' was a far cry from the dancer they used to have...  her outfit looked cheap like something you would expect to see in a beginner student, not in a professional... her dance was no better, no real bellydance moves, no elegance, no quality...  the audience went crazy with her, which was a little surprising until we saw how she kept shaking her cleavage right on men's faces. She also danced -very badly- with a 'sword' that looked like my son's toy swords...  it all just looked crazy and spastic.  I thought maybe she wasn't a real dancer maybe the real dancer couldn't go that night?  but then we found out this was indeed the new dancer...  terrible!   There was no live band that night either...\n\nVeredict:  go for the food!  don't bother for night of Istanbul!", 3], ["I had the smoked burbon chocolate scoop in a cup. I love the Smokey flavour.

I'm not sure if it's the consistency of the gelato that's throwing me off or what, but it's very creamy and super smooth. I've had similar consistencies but the ones at Death in Venice is just throwing me off. The flavours weren't bad but also nothing I would come back for. What was bad was the waffle cone which was soft and didn't have any flavour. Major disappointment. I got to try the pistachio baklava which I thought I was going to be getting for sure when I saw the name but it's very sweet. It's like a mountain of sugar and then you get a hint of pistachio baklava. I sampled maybe two other flavours but I can't even remember what they are anymore and I went just last week. None were very memorable. I don't see myself coming back but it's not bad, just fine.

We got a berry type gelato flavour and it was good, but small.\n\nOverall, this is a very different vibe from a typical gelato place and it almost seems like as if they do not prioritize it as a part of their sales as the server very reluctantly went to the gelato section.

I'll just have to visit again soon.\n\nTheir famous ricotta lemon rosemary wasn't on offer when we went, which was disappointing. Hopefully they're just rotating flavours and it'll be back sometime.

The front part of the place is a bar and the back is the restaurant. Highly recommend.", 5], ["Stopped in on a Friday evening after looking up a place to grab a bite that was close to a concert the Mr and I were going to. I had never heard of The Irv before and am so glad we found this place! \n\nWe were seated immediately and brought menu's and had drink orders taken promptly. The selection of craft beers was pretty awesome and Amsterdam products were being featured that day-props for carrying Boneshaker! \n\nWe were only in the mood for some appetizers and decided on some onion rings and a jalape\u00f1o, bacon, cheddar dip. The orders were both very generous portions and served on wooden platters. Great presentation. \n\nThe dip came with tortilla chips and a small loaf of warm, fresh pretzel bread and was so tasty and cheesy. \n\nThe onion rings were probably the best I've had. Wide cut and perfectly thin and crispy batter. And probably about the size of my palm! They came with 3 different dipping sauces which were a beautiful accompaniment. \n\nI would definately recommend this place and makes efforts to return in the near future.", 5], ["Really good pub fair out of this joint.

I had heard a lot about The Irv, but when I walked in I was seriously underwhelmed. The decor, space, environment wasn't actually all that great.\n\nIn terms of food, I thought the menu was quite nice. Just enough options, not overwhelming but I found the price point to be quite high. Regardless, I chose the fish and chips, and I'll admit, it was good - the servings were very, very small. It was enough for me, but it was the smallest portion of fish I've ever seen. It did taste very good. \n\nHowever, I must say the presentation was very nice. \n\nPs: a coworker of mine went another time, and paid $18 for a grilled cheese with mushroom I believe. He said he enjoyed it.", 4], ["I always forget about this place, but it's a solid place to grab a grilled cheese. It's a cute little pub, and they have great beer specials. I obviously went straight for the reinvented grilled cheese, so I ordered the spicy buffalo chicken grilled cheese. Nothing can be wrong with this combination. Thick cut toast with butter, tons of cheese, pickles and fried chicken with tons of buffalo sauce. It was pretty massive, and for $15 is a pretty good deal. If I can recall, the fries were decent - not the best, not the worst.", 4], ["Cool spot with good eats and nice beer selection with different beer specials each night.\n\nLooks as if it was recently redone and matches the style of a trendy downtown spot while sitting off the beaten path.", 4], ["Yuuuuuuummmmm!!!!

They even have homemade ketchup for the bucket of fries you get with your meal! The beef dip sandwich is amazing, with toasted buttery bread and slices of perfectly cooked beef and delicious beef gravy on the side. I'll definitely be coming back (and probably to order the same beef dip sandwich). \n\nThey have 5$ beer specials all week and then specials for food every day of the week as well!

I had a friend introduce me to this place for a meal after a swim session at the pool and I was surprised at what I found.\n\nWe arrived to a very bustling place and the small patio was packed with people already.  Not too shocked consider the mini second summer the city is experiencing.  We took a table in the back room instead and it was absolutely fine.\n\nThe protein for all the burgers here seem to be sourced from local farmers in the area.  So the prices are all to the left of $15 but under $20.  Of course if you want to have additional items to your burger such as bacon, pulled pork, cheese, a fried egg, wild mushrooms, etc then prepared to add a few more dollars for each.\n\nI took a long look at the burger menu and decided on the el-chapo because a coffee crusted coca-cola bbq glazed burger just spoke to me.\n\nWhen the burgers arrived at our table, they looked very delectable.  The burgers are tall and skinny but the patty had a nice thickness to it and it was slightly pink in the middle which is the advantage of sourcing and not freezing those patties.  The burger was very pleasant and I could taste a hint of that coffee crust which wasn't overwhelming.  The coca-cola bbq sauce was interesting but just give me that regular bbq sauce all the same.  The house side salad was a great compliment even though I was tempted to get the fries.\n\nStaff and service was super friendly and attentive.

We loved that they have daily beer specials for $5 a pint but they've also got their house beer for $5.50 everyday. Beer menu has quite the selection if you want something else besides the daily specials. \n\nWe've heard great things about the 're-invented grilled cheese' menu so I ordered the wild mushroom grilled cheese; husband ordered the buffalo chicken poutine. As mentioned previously, we're not too sure if it was the party behind us or the fact that there were 7 of us but the food took an hour and fifteen minutes (!!) and it was a pub - in reality, just grilled cheese.

Nothing special about the 2 apps but good price. \n- margherita pizza - neopolitan style, I love the thin chewy crust. Safe option to choose.

I would definitely come back for their pizza!", 4], ["Delicious pizza and great craft beers!\n\nI've been to this specific location a couple times now but I've also had food from their university location as well. Servers are always friendly and polite. They have a great list of craft beers on tap and ciders. My favourite thing here is their house made sausage pizza with the chili oil.

The boyfriend and I were so excited to try this place that we actually already looked at the menu before coming and knew exactly what we wanted LOL! \n\nFor appetizers, we chose the buttermilk fried calamari as recommended in many reviews and it was worth the hype. The calamaris were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. On the bottom was a layer of pumpkin (?) sauce. Both of us really enjoyed this! \n\nFor the pizzas, we got the Duck Confit pizza and the Housemade sausage pizza. Both pizzas were pesto-sauce based. The duck confit pizza was a little disappointing despite it being one of the popular pizzas here. The duck was a bit dry and I wasn't really a fan of the pear slices on there. Parts of it also tasted too salty for my liking.\nThe sausage pizza on the other hand was amazingly delicious! The flavour was not as strong as the duck pizza. Both of us really enjoyed that. \n\nWe came here as a belated Valentine's Day dinner and overall it was an enjoyable experience. I felt like this was more of a hangout/casual place rather than a romantic date night place since the music can be a little loud. I definitely see how Libretto is worth the hype and I'll be back to try more pizzas!", 5], ["My friends have raved about this place and I wanted to try the mushroom white pizza after seeing the enticing photos of it. \n\nWe were a group of 10 on a weekday evening. The service was pretty slow. An especially strange thing was that we mentioned to our server that we wanted to order, they acknowledged this but proceeded to disappear for a stretch of time. \n\nI tried the charcuterie board and the mushroom white pizza with vegan mozzarella. I have to say that there wasn't much cheese on the pizza; it felt like a flat bread with some dollops of cheese, mushrooms, thyme, and full pieces of garlic. I don't know about you but full pieces of roasted garlic are not extremely appetizing for me.

There were barely any.\n\nArancini: Italian risotto balls, these tasted great with the tomato sauce. It's super cheesy inside and I can see it being a super popular menu item. Would recommend!\n\nGnocchi: surprisingly, this was my favourite dish of the night and I usually don't like gnocchi! I found the creamy sauce to be delicious and the texture just right.\n\nProsciutto & arugula pizza, funghi pizza, & diavola pizza: to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza.

On a Sunday evening the atmosphere was quiet-ish which was good even with the seven parties in the room. We were able to have a conversation without yelling. \n\nThe food came hot and it tasted great - textures and flavours were balanced and showed variety. When it comes to the pizza, you're getting a very Neapolitan style which means thinner crust, light yet flavourful toppings and that burnt goodness, however it can also leave you wanting just a little more if eaten on an empty stomach. Luckily my friend and I shared this meal and it made the perfect dinner.", 4], ["Priviously tried the pizza here which is really one of best in town.

The pizza when I got it looked more like an oval to me, the crust was slightly burnt, and the toppings fell apart when I was cutting it. I'm not Italian and I don't claim to know what authentic Italian pizza tastes like but I'm pretty sure it shouldn't taste like a mouthful of burnt crust. The pizza dough was soft and well made but the burnt taste just ruined it for me.\n\nThis is one of the fancier pizza places I've been to. Very good service and no complaints here.\n\nThe pizza I ordered was around $20. The size wasn't extremely big but it's enough to fill one up for the meal. However, for that pricing I wished there was a little more.\n\nMaybe it was the hype or maybe I was just served a poor pizza but I didn't enjoy the pizza as much as I wanted.

My go to has always been the King of Kings ramen and the takoyaki but on this day I decided to go with the Katsudon as I am a big fan of donburi. The food, if nothing else, was solid as for the most part the  cutlet was fairly crispy on the outside and the egg on top of the rice was nicely done. The sauce on the cutlet had a sour taste while the sauce on the rice and egg was more on the sweet side.\n\nThe staff here were friendly and constantly came by to check in on us to ensure everything was ok. The food did not take very long to arrive either. In terms of space, the restaurant has seating at the front as well as a few seats near the kitchen area. It can probably hold about 20 people at any given time.

Honestly, eating the noodles reminds me of the wonton noodle soup I would get at cantonese restaurants in chinatown. I would prefer thicker chewier noodles that most ramen places use.\n\nPortion sizes are definitely larger than other ramen shops. I think I've always been pretty biased against kenzo because their choice of ingredients compared to other popular ramen shops around the city are pretty different. I mean, it's still \"ramen\" I guess by definition, and kenzo markets these bowls as an \"original\" take on japanese ramen.\n\nAs far as a bowl of noodle soup, it was enjoyable.

When I ordered it, the server offered to have them make the broth spicier, which was awesome, although I do wish they did have extra chili on the side to make it spicier! It had mushrooms, which I thought was odd. They provide a generous portion for ramen, however, there isn't a lot of meat included with the bowl. It was definitely not the best ramen I've eaten though due to the lack of spices and meat. \n\nMy friend ordered the Yakisoba.

With competition quickly closing in, I find they each have their own specialties. Kenzo specializes in quantity, Kinton specializes in their artisty in making ramen, Hakata specializing in their special variations of ramen, Momofuku specializes in their experience etc. This is my opinion at least. I would just go to Sansotei or Santouka downtown. They have much better ramen, broth and EGG. My rule of thumb is if they jappy then i'm happy meaning they are run by the japanese rather then others such as Chinese or koreans.

Shared a variety of plates amongst 5 folks. \n\nHad the spicy salmon starter, edamame, ebi mayo prawns(very lightly coated, crunchy & flavourful) , soft shell crab (the only thing that disappointed me- extremely oily,seeping of oil - especially compared to the deep fried prawns), tuna tataki (refreshing thin slices), aburi sushi (great selection, came with beef too though, 5 different rolls (dynamite, salmon crunch* unagi*)\n\nGreat for drinks as well.", 4], ["Kintaro Izakaya is located near Wellesley and Church where this eatery has a variety of menu items from yakitori to sushi to ramen (and drinks of course!).

I may have been the only gaijin in the joint. I sat at the bar and the service was great. The maguro tataki was excellent, as was the karaage. The tenderloin yakatori was superb.

The small shop sure filled up quickly. My friend and I ordered a bunch of items to share:\n\nEbi Mayo\nThis dish was actually spectacularly done! The ebi (shrimp) had a very light but crisp batter, and was a decently large size. The tangy mayo dressing was a nice touch, and I really appreciate that they didn't overwhelm the shrimp with dressing. One of my favourites of the night!\n\nSet B\n\nRoasted tomatoes - these came in a skewer of 4, and were these small cherry tomatoes perfectly grilled. They were warm explosions of flavour, but nothing that requires great skill.\n\nMomo Negi - these chicken thigh skewers were very yum! I particularly enjoyed the negi (green onions), which were soft, juicy, and sweet.\n\nMochi Bacon - this also came in a set of 4, and smelled so sinfully delicious! The fatty, crispy bacon was a lovely companion to the soft doughy mochi.\n\nSagari - the 3 piece beef smelled heavenly! It was moist and flavourful, and quite tender!\n\nButarosu - this was my least favourite dish; I didn't really like the fatty pork bits that were oddly chewy. The flavour was okay though.\n\nSaba Shio\nThis grilled mackerel had the loveliest char marks I've ever seen! It was super fatty and fishy (my entire dish was filled with fish oil) but had a lovely texture and bite.\n\nGyu Don\nThe flavour of this bibimbap was good, with the sweet onions and mushrooms and teriyaki sauce. However, the meat was quite disappointing; it was the tough beef flank bits that you find in cheap stores and places. The crispy rice bits at the bottom of the popular piping bowl are always my favourite part! We waited almost 30 minutes for this bowl though... So painstakingly slow.\n\nOverall, it's a great spot to hang out with friends and relax. I was quite sad that they'd run out of the mochi yaki, which I was really interested in trying!", 4], ["For an izakaya the menu was very extensive. Most of the food was very good. Biggest table is about 8 people. I think anything you order will be decent. The price is reasonable for an izakaya. Just remember izakaya probably wont be filling unless you order alot. Watch out for street parking, it is my permit after 6. There are green p and other paid parking lots which arent expensive ($2.5\\hour).

We wanted tapas and drinks and this place happened to have great reviews! \n\nWe walked in and were greeted very pleasantly and seated quickly! \n\nFor drinks we got the Nama lime , Nama grapefruit and Fuji! Loved the concept of Nama found it very interactive! Drinks were great! \n\nWe ordered the seven spice wings, fish and chips (loved the lotus root chips) - was kind of surprised we got a whole fish fried, as we expected a traditional filet! But it was amazing loved the sauce with it. The seven spice wings were by far my favourite dish! Amazing , they have an option of drumsticks as well, but the wings were really really tasty. We then ordered the beef tataki - the green onions with the beef was a great combination, the beef meatballs which melted in our mouth, the spicy salmon was good , but liked the other tapas a lot better.  Last round we ordered the ebi, the spice on the grilled shrimp took me back to fresh shrimp I've had in Bali. Was just mouth watering! And we had the torikawa which is chicken skin fried and seasoned, I didn't like it at all , but on our friends did! It's acquired taste I feel! \n\nOverall loved the place, it was cozy good service and amazing food! Would go back again soon!", 5], ["Tried most of them well known izakayas, Kintaro is the one of the last two on my list.  Great place to come after work for a drink and some great bar food.

The batter was nicely deep fried though, very light and crispy. \n2) Takoyaki = ehhh.. the filling was too mushy and lacked texture but the octopus pieces were alright\n3) Kintaro ramen = nooooooooooope. Fellow Yelpers, you have led me astray. This was not good ramen at all, the noodles resembled cup noodles too much and overall, the broth was lacking in flavour. The presentation was also lackluster. \n4) Chef choice 6pc sushi = yea, not the best I've had. Nothing tasted that fresh and some pieces that were supposed to be \"torched\" were just.. overcooked. It changed the palatability of the fish making it tough and just weird.\n5) Japango roll = Yet again, just average. Not the best I've had, but not bad. I usually love torched sashimi but I'm not a big fan of the way this restaurant does it, they seem to overdo it and it just takes away from the whole \"sashimi\" aspect.\n\nThere was nothing special about this place that would make me want to come back.", 3], ["I really like Kintaro.

We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday there last night and had such a great time. I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance since there was about 18 of us, and the place is really small. Definitely make reservations if you're going. Service was wonderful! The staff were all so friendly and attentive. They even allowed me to bring in my own cake since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant. \n\nEvery single dish we tried was awesome! The skewers were so flavourful. The takoyaki was probably one of my favourite dishes we ordered. The sushi rolls were all really great as well. Some of the other dishes we ordered were squid, ramen, gyoza, quail, and fried chicken (amazing). Definitely no complaints about the food or drinks! \n\nThe atmosphere is way more authentic to Japan than some of the other izakayas in Toronto. You could have an actual conversation but it was still very lively. \n\nThanks so much for a great night! We'll definitely be back!", 5], ["Their butano kakuni (braised pork belly) is to die for!

I would highly recommend all of their seafood dishes (perfect blend of umami and sometimes other surprising flavors subtle upon first bite). \n\nBeautiful traditional japanese interior and seating. This izakaya is also much QUIETER than other izakayas, which tend to be loud and kind of rowdy. The music here tonight was western and medium-low volume, the staff didn't often shout greetings, and the other customers spoke at normal volumes. I could hear my friend, who spoke softly at times, perfectly from across the table.\n\nFood portions here are on the smaller end since Kintaro is tapas style, I would recommend coming here with a group of people and ordering many dishes to share. Pescatarians and vegetarians have no fear... They have a lot of seafood or veggie only options that are just as delicious or even more so than the beef and pork selections :) The server recommended many dishes and we ordered them all lol:\n\nApps:\nSalmon and avocado salad 3.5/5 - Super fresh salmon sashimi A+. Avocado, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes were so refreshing given how protein heavy the rest of the meal was. But as we got the other dishes, this one became less impressive and unique by comparison.\nEbi Mayo 6/5 - One of our favorite dishes tonight! The shrimp were jumbo and coated with tempura (deep-fried), but it was the mayo sauce that tasted so perfect. First bite in, all 3 of us were melting :P\nOkonomiyaki 4/5 - We ordered a seafood one. It was smaller than other ones I've ordered elsewhere in the past, but was thick, heavy, and had wonderful tasting toppings and sauce. the dough part was a bit slimy, which I wasn't a fan of, but great flavor.\n\nSkewers: We decided not to order the sets since 2 of us doesn't eat red meat and you can't customize your own sets\n\nScallop 3/5 - Scallops were too small\nEbi 1/5 - Only giving it a 1 since my standards for this place has gotten so high XD The shrimp were tiny and flavors nonexistent. Nothing special, you can replicate this at home.\nIka teriyaki 5/5 - My personal favorite skewer since I love squid. It wasn't on a stick like the other skewers, but was grilled, which gave the squid excellent texture and flavor. The teriyaki sauce on top was sweet, enhanced the squid's nature flavor, and not overbearing. \nEringi 3/5 - I like king mushrooms, but that was really all that it tasted like. Didn't have any sauce to enhance the flavor, but was cooked with butter (mandatory to not burn on the grill). Dunno what I was expecting.\nYaki mochi 6/5 - Really liked this one! Big mochi balls, also not on a stick. Subtle honey sweetness on the outside, crispy outer covering, chewy umami center (mochi). Sweet + umami = killer combo\n\nPaid ~$30 per person not including tip. Wonderful experience here tonight and will definitely keep coming back.", 5], ["First of all, the wall decoration made me feel I was in izakaya in Tokyo. \n\nFor appetizer, we had deep fried oyster, agedashi tofu and buta kakuni. Everything were so good. Buta Kakuni would be highly recommended! \n\nI had Nagasaki chanpon too. Soup was ok but they put way too much chili. I needed to put away from soup first. And noodle should be thick egg noodle but it was thinner ramen noodle. A little disappointment. \n\nOur server was super friendly and best!", 3], ["Food was mediocre.

My table ordered the Set A and Set B skewers, Okonomiyaki, Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage, Beef Tataki and yaki mochi. \n\nI liked Set A overall, but my partner liked set B more. The main reason why I liked Set A more was because of the scallops and the eringi. I wasn't too much of a fan of the mochi \n- The skewer sets were good and each had its own merits and demerits.\n- I liked the beef tenderloin over the striploin. Sagari beats Karubi.\n- The pork belly and neck were pretty close.\n- The Momo Negi was much better than the Cheese Mune, but there was green onion (I dislike green onions).\n\nThe okonomiyaki and the takoyaki were good. I'd recommend them.\nThe chicken karaage pieces were smaller than the ones i've had at other tapa's and weren't as juicy than other tapa's in toronto.\n\nI liked the beef tataki sauce and apparently the yaki mochi was very good as a dessert.\n\nI would probably suggest that they have a 'choose any 4 skewers meal' because these skewers aren't actually that big.

The chashu was melt-in-your-mouth and had a good ratio of fat to meat. You also get about 4-5 thin delicious pieces of chashu and surprisingly that's more than most ramen places are offering. \n2. I like how their noodles are al dente. I like the chewiness, so maybe this isn't for everyone. \nOverall, their soup base isn't overly savoury. One of the better ramens I've had. \n\nThe ebi mayo came as a recommendation from our waiter. It was my first time here and wanted to try a popular item there. I was not disappointed, even though ebi mayo isn't a very unique dish and can be found in most izakayas. The prawns were quite large and fried to a perfect consistency of crispy.\n\nAmbiance: 4 stars\nA cool and hip izakaya.

I can see how it would be too salty and plain without the condiments, so go all out on them and each bite will be a surprise! The bacon was chewy and cooked to just the right texture.

When I got my sandwich and saw that there was nothing on it but peameal I was skeptical to say the least. They do have condiments you can add but I decided to have it alone to see how it would hold up. I must say that the simplicity of this sandwich was beautiful and both ingredients were executed nicely. The bacon is cooked on a flat top which gives it a nice little crust on the outside but keeps it pretty juicy and moist. The peameal has a nice bite to it but still tears away easily. One key aspect was that the bacon had the right amount of saltiness (I feared that the saltiness would be overwhelming). The kaiser roll complimented the bacon very well, it was very fresh, soft with just the right amount of flakiness on the outside. \nI must say that this sandwich may have converted me to peameal bacon over regular bacon. It is much meatier and no where near as fatty as regular bacon. I truly enjoyed the sandwich plain but next time I may add some mustard which I feel would add a little zing to it. \nIf you are visiting St. Lawrence market stop in at carousel and get a peameal bacon sandwich, you will not regret it!", 4], ["So apparently Carousel Bakery is famous for its peameal bacon sandwich.

This oversized sandwich cost me $5.50 and my hunger was satisfied for hours (approximately 6 or 7).\n\nI would have appreciated the sandwich more if heat was added or if it was prepared fresh upon ordering.  This one happened to be already made, wrapped up, just sitting there asking me to buy it.  It was still incredibly fresh so it was probably made only moments earlier.\n\nThere are also hot sandwich options like the obvious peameal bacon or veal.

The service was good the food was great I had one of the pizzas and it was enough to take home. I will definitely be back with new friends!", 4], ["Pros: Great food and service, cute decor...try the chicken and waffles!\n\nCons: Way too noisy for me to enjoy a nice dinner (had to constantly shout at my date to be able to have a conversation). All that noise gave me a headache afterwards", 3], ["My cousin and I randomly passed by this place on Sunday. I must say, I really did enjoy their brunch menu esp because its more known for a bar. They serve genetic brunch food but the food quality was pretty good.  I ordered their pea-meal bacon with hollandaise sauce, extra sausage on the side and my cousin had their smoked salmon. We both really enjoyed our meal. I definitely would recommend this place but be prepared to wait a bit.", 4], ["Had the chicken honey lavender it was delicious, the vegetables were good also.

This was our first time at Levetto's, we had the affumicato pizza and arugula goat-cheese salad.\nIt is one of the best pizzas we've had; fresh, flavourful and not over the top. The service is also friendly; a great place to have a good memorable meal without a lot of fuss.", 5], ["Levetto is a place that i go to for quick pasta. The portion sizes are fairly large. One of the pastas we got was under cooked and when we let the server know, she took it and re-made us another one. So i would say they have great service at this location. The pasta noodle here are al dente so if you like more cooked and softer pasta, this place might mot be for you. Also, due to the undercooked vodka sauce pasta, they graciously gifted us a chocolate mousse tart. I thought it was very kind of them and i enjoyed the creamy texture as well as the crunchiness at every bite.", 5], ["Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After \"happy birthday\", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.", 2], ["Went here for the first time on the weekend. We got there around 8 o'clock and the restaurant was pretty empty. SUCH GOOD PASTA. I got the carbonara and bf got the beef ragu, both very very tasty. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had! My carbonara had the perfect al dente pasta and the sauce was creamy but still light so you don't get sick eating too much of it. I couldn't finish my pasta so I took some home and it still taste good the next day. The server was attentive and nice as well! All in all a very pleasant experience.\nCheck in for the free dessert!", 5], ["Came on a Saturday evening at 5:30 and it was empty. I had this place on my list of food to try and was looking forward to checking in and getting a free dessert. \n\nI was sad when they told me there wasn't any more panna cotta left which is what they would normally give as the free dessert. \n\nI ordered the Smoked Prosciutto pizza which wasn't bad, I enjoyed the dough as it was crispy but still fluffy inside. Looks like they make everything fresh by hand which is nice. I will try have to try the pasta next time.", 3], ["Great little spot tucked away in Liberty village. The pizza was really good for a thicker crust pizza. Although it was thick, the dough was very fluffy and light, but crispy on the outside. Their Funghi pizza was a very solid mushroom pizza,and their pasta seems to be freshly made in house. Their staff were really friendly, and good folks. We witnessed the staff celebrating a fellow coworker's birthday with a candle in pizza.. What hard working staff, working hard on a Saturday night late shift. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and craving some good well priced Italian food.", 5], ["Visiting Toronto From Carmel, IN!

It's in a quiet neighbourhood, with not too much traffic, with some street parking nearby. \n\nWe started with the Ceasar Salad (fresh, with large pieces of pancetta and fresh croutons), and the Arugula Salad (this is bright with goat cheese and fruit to complement the peppery arugula). We had the Soppressata pizza which was more like a flatbread, but still very tasty. The Carbonara was really good (though this is according to my dining mates, as I am not a fan of Carbonara in general), but the star pasta was the Beef Ragu (perfectly done pasta, with a rich tomato sauce and piece of Beef Ragu...YUM!) All the food is always fresh, and perfectly cooked (which is important because I HATE overdone pasta). \n\nThis place always feels like fancy Italian food, without the fancy setting.

Flavour wise I thought it wasn't boring, which sometimes happens with simple tomato pastas, and quite tasty. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce coated the soaghetti noodles nicely. I think it's definitely worth trying for it's simple but rich flavour. Given the price you are paying for (~$9 for the dish) you're receiving a pretty big portion.\n\nI also used the Yelp check in function and got free dessert! Friends and I ordered most of the offered desserts and I tried the white chocolate tiramisu and coconut cake. The tiramisu was very underwhelming, presentation and taste wise. Maybe because I was expecting a traditional tiramisu layered dessert but this was just lady fingers stacked onto each other with some cream. I'm not complaining as it was free dessert, but if you were to pay for it I don't think it'd be worth it. The coconut cake on the other hand was delicious! It is a very dense, moist, and strong coconut flavoured cake. A bit heavy, but good to share with others.

But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still....

Everything we wanted and needed was always there in a timely and attentive manner.   We ordered food to eat \"family style\".  The Romaine salad and the Arugula salad with the addition of chicken were enough for the 10 of us to share.  The Romaine was made special with crispy speck and the Arugula had a beautiful tangy flavor when married with all of the flavours of the pumpkin seeds, apricots, goat cheese and white wine vinaigrette. We also ordered  a couple of pasta dishes to share. The Rigatoni beef ragu was my fave from my last visit and it was very tasty this time around. But, I cannot say enough about how delicious the Tagliatelle was.  Grape tomatoes,  sweet peas and dill in a very creamy tomato sauce.  We addd lobster which upped the flavor a notch.\nNow that should all been enough but being the gluttons we are we also shared and enjoyed 3 pizzas.  The Soppressata did not let us down with its spicy flavor.   The Funghi did not fall short one bit with portobello,  oyster and cremini laying on a bed of mascarpone and roasted garlic crema. So very hard to pick my fave.\nAs you know by now sharing is what we like to do and desserts at Levetto are very worth sharing.  White chocolate Tiramisu and Warm Brown Butter and Coconut Cake.

Don't expect waited on, it's \"Hey Meatball\" type of restaurant but everything needed is in close proximity, ie. napkins, forks, knives, etc. I can only give it 4/5 stars because the pasta came out warm although it was quite good and there is no wind shield for the small restaurant so whenever the door opens a gust of cold wind comes in.", 4], ["Wow.

You don't have to travel far to have a taste of a Sunday Roast dinner, as you can now find it at Weslodge. Situated in the heart of King Street West is Weslodge, a modern saloon-inspired restaurant by Ink Entertainment. The restaurant is pretty distinguishable by its illuminated, slab-lettered marquee lights and large yellow doors. Once inside, you are welcome into a large space furnished with cutting-edge design and decor. \n\nThe restaurant prides itself on their extensive selection of expertly mixed classic drinks, which I had the chance to try. My cocktail was mixed by one of the mixologists at the bar, and it was sweet to my liking. \n\nWeslodge introduced their version of the Sunday Roast Dinner earlier this past December, and it's now available every Sunday from 3 pm to close. The dinner is $35 per person, and features roast meat (beef or lamb) served with the following accompaniments; Yorkshire pudding, potatoes, seasonal vegetables, a jug of gravy, and choice of dessert. \n\nI really enjoyed the Potatoes, as they were golden, crispy, and didn't taste oily to me. \n\nThe meal also came with a dish of Seasonal Vegetables, which change often depending on the season. Personally, I found the vegetables too salty for my liking, so I didn't touch much of it.  \n\nYorkshire Pudding is an English food made from batter, and is usually part of the traditional Sunday roast. The one from Weslodge was huge and light - and as a carbs lover, I am not complaining. \n\nFor my meat option, I opted for the Roast Beef, which did not disappoint. The roast was cooked to pink, so it was medium on the outside, while being fairly rare on the inside. I loved it! It was tender, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor. Although the gravy was very good, I didn't need to drown my meat with it.  \n\nFor dessert, I got their Sticky Toffee Pudding - vanilla ice cream, which is also available on their regular dessert menu. It was a great ending to a wonderful meal. \n\nOverall, the Sunday Roast at Weslodge was an enjoyable dinner. The service was attentive, friendly, and non-pretentious. Mondays are usually the worst, so the Sunday Roast Dinner at Weslodge is the perfect way to make your weekend feel a little longer.", 5], ["I dined at Weslodge on a Friday night and decided to come here with a group of 5 other friends to try their Summerlicious menu. I wouldn't think my experience would be this bad but...it was underwhelming and I was left with a really bad experience here. I would like to say that our waitress was great and friendly but other factors and situations caused the experience to be a huge miss. I will definitely not be coming back here nor will I recommend this place to any of my friends/family.\n\nFood wise, it was not bad. For summerlicious I ordered the ahi tuna tartare, the sea bream, and the peach crumble. The ahi tuna tartare was probably my favourite out of the three dishes but the sea bream was also cooked well and had a great char to it. The peach crumble was too warm and the panna cotta tasted more like a yogurt than anything. Did I think it was worth $43 for dinner? Probably not; portions for the tartare and sea bream could have been bigger; sometime less like $33 would be more reasonable.\n\nService wise, our waitress was great. She was attentive and friendly and made sure we got everything we needed (and we do not ask for a lot to begin with). \n\nWhat made the whole experience sour was the fact that it felt like a sauna in the entire restaurant the entire time we were there. Our whole party felt sweaty and hot during our entire meal which really ruined the experience. I'm not sure if the air conditioner wasn't working properly or whatnot, but no explanation was given as to why the temperature in the restaurant was probably hotter than outside. Really a shame. Secondly, during our dessert course, half the desserts came out first. One party member had finished his dessert already and half of the table still had yet to receive theirs. The ice cream on the desserts of course melted at a rapid pace with the hot sweaty space of the restaurant. \n\nLastly, what put the icing on the cake during this underwhelming and disappointing experience was a very rude and inconsiderate staff nearing the end of our dining experience at Weslodge. I had decided to use the washroom before leaving the restaurant and when I went upstairs to the washrooms, I encountered a man who seemed like a chef (?) working at Weslodge. He pointed at a closed washroom door. I was unclear of what his message was so I hesitated; I wasn't sure if he was pointing at the door to signal to me that this was the only washroom working or if this was a free washroom (...this is also the fact that I was a woman in a dimly lit area of the restaurant with no one in sight, I didn't know who he was as he did not even verbally talk to me, he just pointed at the washroom door which confused me). It was when I hesitated that he yelled \"GO!\" very aggressively at me. I was quite shocked at how he talked to me that I didn't even process it at first. However, afterwards, I found his attitude and aggressiveness very rude. No restaurant staff should ever treat their customers like this.\n\nI will not be coming back.", 2], ["Came here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. \n\nThe cocktails were pretty impressive, and the food was pretty good as well. We ordered the Foie Gras & Waffle, Fried Calamari, Cauliflower, and Burrata & Mushroom. Loved the Foie Gras and Cauliflower dishes, but the calamari was too salty for my preference. My friends thought it was fine so maybe it's just my palette. We finished off with the sticky toffee pudding which was my favorite dish of the night. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and when there was a mix up with our drinks they comped them for us. The DJ that night was great too. Played all 90s/early 2000s hip-hop and R&B. Took me back to high school.", 4], ["Might have been an off night for our server, but our mains took over an hour to arrive. I ordered the Mac and cheese and spinach sides. I'm a vegetarian so that's pretty much all they had for me to choose from. Mac and cheese does not list bacon in it on the menu but part way through I tasted it (too late, already in my mouth)! Server apologized profusely and said she forgot to verbally ask if bacon was ok. \n\nI realize a lot of people are into bacon. Coolio. However lots of people have allergies, are Jewish, Muslim or vegetarian and don't eat it. Should definitely be listed as an ingredient on the menu folks! \n\nAfter dinner, we ordered various coffees, espressos etc, they all came quickly except for the Spanish coffee which the server brought way later apologizing saying they were training someone new to make it. Finally it came cold (?!)...they had made a Spanish martini instead by mistake. We didn't have time to wait for them to make another so sent it back untouched and were told it would be taken off the bill.\n\nWhen we got the bill ($280 for 4 of us) they had charged us for both the bacon Mac and cheese and Spanish martini errors.\n\nThey also don't have air conditioning or it wasn't working, so we were all uncomfortably hot the entire time.

Food came so fast. Egg Benedict with smoked trout was okay, while Fried chicken with waffle was too (overly) sweet for my liking. The service was meh, the waiter wasn't given a friendly and chatty service.\nDespite their gorgeous interior, there's nothing special in this place.", 2], ["Came here twice in one week. Love the ambiance of the place. Dimly lit, decorated like a hunting lodge, with a gorgeous bar. \n\nFirst visit: \n- Arrived kinda late, around 9 p.m., on a Tuesday evening. Got seated immediately and ordered off the appetizer menu. Our server, poor guy, was the only one serving several tables. As a result, service was much slower than we would've liked, but I'm guessing they were understaffed on a Tuesday evening. Our server was really friendly though. \n- Seabass ceviche: Marinated in lime and some other stuff, topped with sliced jalapeno, and served with what tasted like pita chips. Really liked this dish as it was flavored just right and tasted really fresh. Also light and citrusy enough to offset my two other orders. \n- Mushroom and burrata, topped with shaved truffle, on top of crostini: this was really good, but not sure it's good enough to make the price point worth it. I'd say try it at least once. \n- Foie gras and waffle: This was my favorite and the reason why I went back a second time. Seared foie on top of a waffle, drizzled all around with balsamic vinegar sauce. Perfectly balanced flavors. \n\nSecond visit: \n- Arrived super early, 5:30 p.m. on Friday for a solo dinner. Greeter at door was a bit unfriendly; I'm guessing she was grouchy I couldn't seem to get the door open? Sat at the bar, and the friendly bartender greeted me immediately. \n- Ordered the sea bass ceviche again, which was...a bit off this time. Needed more lime juice. \n- Foie gras and waffle: this was also not as well executed as it was last time. The waffle was soggy and there was way too much balsamic sauce; in fact, the waffle was completely soaked in the sauce. \n- Grilled branzino: Meh. I've had better. \n- Bartender was attentive and friendly, so definitely no complaints about the service. \n\nWould I come back? Not sure--the food seems to be hit or miss, which isn't ideal at these prices.", 3], ["Weslodge is a western themed saloon restaurant with beautiful decor and delicious food! \nThe appetizer menu has some interesting items. Their smoked trout is excellent, and dates stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon is decadent! \n\nAnother specialty is large plates of meat to be shared. We tried perfectly cooked steak and juicy chicken! If we had more people, we would totally be tempted to try their larger portion aged steak.\n\nOf course we can't forget the desert! The banana mousse and dulce de leche was my favorite, and their rice pudding and chocolate cake were excellent as well! \n\nThe service was very attentive but not overbearing. We really enjoyed our time there! It wasn't super busy on a Thursday night. We were able to walk in and get a window seat.", 5], ["You've got to be kidding me.  Brown lettuce? What a poor show.

This restaurant is basically a can't miss because it has big yellow doors as a grand entrance.

As soon as you walk in you''ll see how dark it is in there and how it works because you can still have good conversations even with all the noise. The interior design is very detailed and sophisticated enough to dress up here; but you could definitely come in here with a pair of nice sneakers.  From the cowboy saloon/hipster/hunter feel to this restaurant, Weslodge pulls it off. \n\nThe service is top notch and if you get Bryce as your waiter you'll be going in and out happy.

Definitely recommended.", 5], ["I came to Weslodge for brunch on a whim and it was probably 90% because of the big yellow doors outside. So cool! The decor inside was even more impressive; honestly one of the more beautifully done restaurants I've seen.\n\nThere were very few other tables for brunch so we got a lot of attention from our server who was on point throughout the entire experience. I loved the attention to detail in little things like the cute absynthe-style glass our sugar cubes were served in.\n\nFood itself was quite delicious. The eggs benedict with the lamb bacon was quite enjoyable. My guest had the fried chicken with house made biscuit which was divine. So tasty. We also had a side of fries and I loved how they did them.

But this annoying little company is growing in Toronto and I dread the day we can no longer ask for ice water at a restaurant...", 5], ["Great ambiance, service, and food. Their stuffed seabass was heavenly and scotch eggs albeit their tiny size (think quail's eggs) were delicious. Old fashioned is served properly and well made.

I had the croquette as well as the sausage rolls for my starter, and while the sausage rolls were great, the croquettes just didn't do it for me. They are supposed to be a classic dish, but somewhere along the lines it was butchered and I didn't really understand what they were going for in terms of flavor. For my main, I had the braised beef and it was literally two small pieces of beef (the size of a domino) with large chunks of onion in some sort of broth. The beef was very tender and juicy with a lot of flavor, but there was way too little on the plate to truly enjoy or even justify spending $30 on. Our main took a little long to get out of the kitchen so, our server promptly apologized and informed us of this, then offered us free dessert to make up for it. We got some sort of berry tart and it was made beautifully, down to the crust. \n\nOverall, the food is nothing impressive, but I would definitely come back for their extensive and well done cocktail selections as well as the service!", 2], ["Came here with a group of 6 a few weeks ago on a Friday. Heard mixed reviews but it wasn't really up to me. \n\nAfter a drink at the bar, and some awkward maneuvers around the waiter/waitress traffic, we were finally seated at our table. Ordered a few old fashioned(the usual), and it was decent. \n\nSteak tartare - pretty delish!\nFried Chicken Platters - Crispy, and surprisingly plentiful. \nScotch eggs - decent, but will not order again. \n\nGirls got salad?

Getting in to this place is quite difficult they have really big doors which required quite some muscle to open this they have a host that has to push and pull the door for you. Imagine being on a date and wearing heels and putting so much effort into opening the door. The thing me and my sister noticed was all the servers and bartenders are guys which is a first in all the restaurants I've been in Toronto I don't know why that is the case. The service was very friendly tho and everyone went out of their way to ask if everything was going okay. There was a lot of people working that day I guess and it wasn't busy so we were definitely spoiled. The food was really good I highly enjoyed my scotch egg that was coated in duck meat. I opted for the mushroom Wellington as my main and it was quite nice but the gravy could be improved upon. For dessert I got the apple crumble and it was definitely had that familiar home made taste I look for in my pie. And the server was also nice enough to give us free shots to end our meal. So definitely a great experience overall.", 5], ["Very nice ambient but nothing more. \nNoise level is quite high, food is ok, drinks so so (my White Russian was very white, very watery and it saw the kalua with a binocular). \n\nOverall overpriced for the portion you get and the food you taste. \n\nThe service was pretty good (not sure if I got lucky or what since it seems from the reviews that quite a few haven't been v lucky).", 2], ["This place does NOT mess around when it comes to cocktails. Personally I found the options a bit overwhelming but our server worked with me and talked through the massive list of options and found a couple of likable options. \n\nI think I prefer this place for drinks over food.

(N.B. this review is based on a Summerlicious dinner)\n\nAtmosphere: Beautiful saloon style decorations, cushy booth seating, and excellent choice in light fixtures. Bartenders wear the traditional western suspenders you might see in old movies. The whole restaurant has a western saloon feel, and I can't say enough about how casual but classy the vibe is here. The crowd is mostly from the financial district, hanging around the bar for post-work drinks.\n\nService: Cool service. Not cool as in nice, but cool as in detached, perfunctory, and a little less than courteous. However, our server checked on us 12 times during the meal, which was appreciated, if somewhat an annoyance. Given the price of a meal + 1 drink (~$50), and the 20% tip that I usually leave, it was the kind of attentiveness I would expect from a place like this. \n\nFood: Scrumptious desserts, but the main course and apps weren't very memorable. The scotch egg was crunchy on the outside, and the chorizo was flavourful, but it didn't wow the tastebuds. We had the Sea Bass + Quinoa for the main: cooked well, but once again, just average. Dessert was a Panna Cotta, which came with pieces of ginger-y honey cake and bits of granny smith apples. I can't say enough about how well the combination of flavours worked in this plate. Definitely recommended. \n\nTheir cocktails are also highly recommended. They specialize in what appears to be traditional saloon drinks, so expect a lot of brandy, gin, bourbon, and bitters. If you are especially sensitive to alcohol, note that the cocktails tend to run strong! Ask the server for help with your drink order. \n\nOverall: Probably won't do a full meal here again, but will be returning for the cocktails and desserts. 3 stars for the food/drinks, and an extra star just because the ambiance is truly awesome.

I swear they probably get 95% of their guests coming in because of those yellow doors...and to be honest I am one of those people (because I guess I can't find places unless they slap me in the face with their lack of subtlety).

Delicious. Tender, flavourful, filling. It also comes with some pieces of crab meat, which (forgive me if I am woefully ignorant) seemed like a strange combo. Well, if it works, it works. It worked.\nFor dessert, I went for the milk cake which had candied nuts and other sophisticated things attached to it. The cake was perfect. Delicate flavour, just right moistness without being too soggy.\n\nAnd I really need to commend the decor. So it may be a bit over the top, but if the giant yellow doors didn't tip you off, I think that's what they were going for. Vintage-looking (but obviously expensive) stuffed plush chairs, carefully aged wooden tables, high class saloon decor (oxymoronic, yes), so hipster it hurt. Hurt so good.\n\nOn my way to the bathrooms, I noticed that the second floor has a private room that is sectioned off with velvety curtains and situated on a balcony of sorts that looks out onto the main dining floor. Looked like it would seat around 10 people or so. Seems like a perfect birthday camp for a group that enjoys voyeurism and people-watching.

The pot pie definitely had a nice flavor, though I was a little disappointed about the lack of meat on the dish. That being said, the attention to ingredients and the way everything blended together taste-wise was quite remarkable. The one downfall of the dish is that they put the pie crust on the bottom, but it is probably more suited to go on top since it is more flaky pastry dough that ends up getting soggy under the gravy.\n\nOverall, this place is quite expensive, but the quality of the service and ambiance are fitting.

I felt the mains plating could have been better, since they lacked the finesse you'd see in a restaurant of that caliber. Only the \"bacon and eggs\" app blew us away with a wonderful marriage of mellowness from the egg component and bold flavours from the \"bacon\" and onions (dish not on regular menu). Everything else was a bit of a blur after a couple of days so I felt the food left so much more to be desired.\nI also felt slightly uncomfortable dining here, since the restaurant seemed filled with business executives and the wealthy.

Also worth mentioning that the cocktails served are reallly generous pours, so settle in for the glow of a warm afternoon regardless of how cold it is outside.", 5], ["Enjoyed a couple of cocktails and a dozen oysters with my mom on the patio following Toronto Fashion Week in Yorkville. How boujee!\n\nWhen we initially sat down, we saw two fab ladies drinking a pink beverage out of champagne flutes. We asked our waiter what the drinks were and he stated they weren't on the menu - so of course we ordered two! Tip : ask for a flute of champagne with a shot of vodka and muddled raspberries - just delightful!\n\nWe enjoyed sitting on the patio people watching and sipping our off menu cocktails.\n\nA gentleman came around as we were sipping our drinks and offered us some amazing house made bread with butter - so good! Everything was lovely however one of our oysters had a bit of sandy grit in it. My mom mentioned it to a server who was walking by - she was very apologetic and lovely then brought out two other ones to replace it.\n\nDefinitely would return again!", 4], ["Food was absolutely outstanding, and the service was better than any place I've been before. The perfect wine pairings were suggested for our courses, and everything tasted delicious. It's a pricey spot, so if you are on a budget, save it for a special occasion.", 5], ["Came in on a Wednesday just past midnight.\nVery dead and very very rude, full of attitude.. it's a hotel bar but supposedly they can do their last call at 12.30 and then they call their clients lucky to be served! I have never been anywhere with so much attitude.. Absolutely terrible service!", 1], ["This is a GREAT spot if you want someone to feel special. \nAfter walking by this fancy-ish spot many times, I was treated to a birthday brunch here.\nStaff was fantastic - friendly but formal, same with the entire experience. We were seated on the patio, and the entire service was flawless - I had the ricotta pancakes & my sidekick had the chicken & waffles. Both were delicious, I was not disappointed! \nThis place has a somewhat lavish reputation, and the staff and ambiance of even the patio definitely make you feel like a star. The patio is filled with champagne bottles and oversized sunglasses, but staff is superb at making even the most novice Yorkville-ite feel welcome and important. \nGreat experience if you want to spoil someone and are feeling fancy.\nPrices are decent for the experience ($65 for a Saturday brunch - that included drinks).", 4], ["Vegetarian Review\n\nDelicious Vegetarian options and very accommodating. \n\nI'm surprised One does not have higher reviews. It is on the expensive side and the clientele is generally high brow, pretentious types. \n\nI've been to the restaurant for personal and work related dinners. The staff is polite and nice and help neutralize the general douche baggery in the lounge. \n\nThe food is always great both in the restaurant and catering for larger groups. We just did an event at the Hazelton. I think they are connected with ONE. The Food was incredible.", 5], ["Went there for winterlicious, $28 for a 3 courses meal which is exceptional value! I would recommend anyone to go there during winterlicious. Food was decent, for the price of this place, I expect more from them tho. \n\nIf you are not going during winterlicious, it's very expensive, unless you are making tons of money. Well its fine dining in a really nice high class restaurant.\n\nHowever at the end of the day, for that kind of price range there's a lot of better places out there for better food and atmosphere.", 3], ["The steak was overcooked. Sent it back, came back overcooked. This is a disappointing experience for a restaurant that perceives itself as one of the best in the city. Sad day for the City of Toronto. Don't order the steak.", 2], ["For a restaurant charging 22$ for a green salad, I would expect much better. We were appealed by the patio on Yorkville that seemed comfortable, so we have it a chance, for the last time.\n\nFirst off, we had to wait over 20 minutes to have a waitress coming over and ask is if we wanted something to drink. We had time to even select our food since his waiting was so long!\n\nEven if we asked to the waitress if the foie gras and the Brie were sweet and she answered by the negative, we could not imagine anything sweeter than those 2 appetizers. Watch out if you are diabetic! \n\nOn top of that, she got one of our 2 simple appetizer wrong and they brought us a wrong one.\n\nAfter we complained about the extremely sweet dishes we had, we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. Both of my husband and I have felt sick to our stomach the entire evening following our visit at One! Imagine paying a 200$ bill and be sick? Hats unacceptable!\n\nThe manager of the restaurant -- who has actually been very kind and the one star I'm giving is only dedicated to her -- came see us and apologized for the terrible dining experience we just had. It was nice of her to do it and we appreciated her apology. Unfortunately, it didn't take away our stomachache!", 1], ["Quick warning: there's currently some construction on Yorkville ave that's blocking access to this restaurant however, if you go around the block, you can arrive on the other side. \n\nNow, back to the review: with the reservations that we booked we were able to be seated on the patio which is so adorable and they sat us towards the back which was on a quiet street. \n\nIt started with ordering The Six which was the perfect amount of Tromba to warm up any part of me that would start to get cold with the sun going down and being offered individual servings of warm bread which was delish (despite not believing in taking more than one piece of bread, they return throughout the night to offer you as much as you'd like). \n\nSummerlicious was going on while we were there so we utilized the menu. The tuna tacos were so nice and I got the sea bass as my entree. Typically I preferred the skin to be removed from my fish however, I did my best to remove it myself and it was very light and flavourful. The flourless chocolate cake and champagne was the perfect way to end the dinner. \n\nI obviously couldn't resist looking at the regular menu - I loved the drink menu. Tons of options from wine, to cocktails to various liqueurs. The food menu was pretty substantial - especially for a higher end restaurant. There's something for everyone here!", 4], ["I fondly recall a dinner here a few years ago, and more recently recall a lot of drinks had here in the last few months.\n\nHeart of Yorkville; great service; great drinks. Beautiful decor - this is a place to be seen, certainly. This is also a place to have a terrific set of after-work-Xmas-party-drinks... :-)", 4], ["You get what you pay for. $$$$.  The art ladies who lunch.....we had a great time.  Attentive friendly staff.  My burger fell apart but was scrumptious.  We loved it!  Read the reviews  of people encountering obnoxious patrons.  These high end restos seem to attract these types.  Ignorant with money is the worst kind.\nHave eaten at the bar previously.  My friend and I were treated wonderfully.", 5], ["I came here for Winterlicious 2015 and remember being the most excited for this place based on the menu and pictures I had seen, and in the end I was pleased with my choice. To start off with, the staff here were super super nice. I was horrifically late for my dinner and left my friend sitting by himself for about half an hour, but apparently the waitress was super nice to him and came around to check up on him a lot lol, and throughout our meal she was quite attentive and friendly and chatty with us.\n\nFor my meal, I had the scallop and pork belly to start. I LOVED the scallop and wished there was more than one, although it was a big one. The pork belly was good but a bit basic, it had Korean BBQ sauce on it and some avocado puree on the side, some napa, etc. kind of Asian-inspired. Good, but didn't really blow me away. That scallop though...\n\nFor my main, I ordered the short rib and thought the dish was well done, I liked the crispy onions on the top and thought they went well with the rib. The rib was wonderfully soft and tender, and I remember thinking this one was better than the one I had tried at La Societe the previous evening - perhaps the ingredients were just more interesting and the plating was more attractive.\n\nI tried the citrus pavlova for dessert, having never had pavlova before. When it came out I thought it looked really nice, but unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan in the end - something about the texture of the pavlova didn't work for me. It was like crunchy on the outside but had a slightly chewy texture on the inside, it was sweet but in kind of an artificial, almost marshmallow-y way... perhaps just not my kind of dessert. It came with passionfruit sorbet and berries, and I remember thinking the passionfruit sorbet just didn't mix well with the pavlova - it added this extra bit of tartness and slight bitterness almost that just didn't work. \n\nEverything was plated super nicely, with artistic little garnishes. I quite enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and might consider coming back if I happen to be in the area!", 4], ["Boy for the location and price, the services here SUCKED.\n\nFood is overpriced for the service you get.\n\nFood itself is not bad.\n\nWe were meeting friends here.  6 of us for dinner followed by about 25 people for drinks.\n\nOur server during dinner was really not attentive at all.\n\nThe server for drinks later had some real attitude.\n\nInstead of asking everyone for their credit card to keep the tab open and everything organized, she decided to put everything on one bill and have everyone pay for their portion.  When requested, she had some attitude.  Lady, working in an establishment like this, you gotta be professional; you turned out to be a food and probably lost a lot in tips.", 2], ["I sat on the patio with my husband to enjoy an appetizer and a cocktail as a snack while we strolled through Yorkville. There were small yellow/green bugs/spiders EVERYWHERE! I killed probably 6 as we sat out there...i think they drop from the hanging trees. It was so gross. The drinks were very subpar and lacked something special - at $19 a cocktail, I expect a great cocktail. I was disappointed overall with this place.", 2], ["A great patio location in Yorkville!! They have AMAZING focaccia bread and the grilled Octopus was to die for!!", 4], ["My fiance took me here to propose to me the day before Valentine's Day so I will forever love One Restaurant for this very reason. \n\nIn terms of the restaurant itself, I thought the atmosphere was beautiful, cozy and warm. \n\nThe service was great. To be honest, the bread boys were the most pleasant- so polite and just had such a kind demeanour. The waiter we had was polite and to the point. He gave us our privacy, which is what my fiance prefers when we go out and eat; less talk, more food. For me, I like a little conversation from the waiter. For some reason it bummed me out that he didn't ask if we were here for a special occasion or not. I go to the Keg often and they ALWAYS ask if I'm celebrating or just having a nice dinner out. That's just my personal preference though and I'm not docking any points. \n\nThe food was DELICIOUS. The steak was moist and succulent. Perfectly cooked- just the way we asked. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and tasty. \n\nLobster spoons were so so good. Creamy, buttery and flavourful. \n\nThe mango sorbet was yummy and the fruit toppings were fresh. \n\nWe had other delicious things too that I can't remember exactly what we had but all I know is I left very full and very happy.  \n\nThe only reason I docked one star is because the manager came out to talk to a couple that obviously frequents the restaurant. She talked to them for a very long time, quite loudly. It didn't really bother me because I think loyal customers should be treated well! Plus, their conversation was kind of funny and cute. What bothered me is that she ignored everyone sitting around the couple's table and didn't even bother to say 'Good evening. How is your meal?'. Considering One Restaurant is a fine dining restaurant, I have a higher expectation of management. It just made my fiance and I feel unwelcome at a place we were visiting for the first time. \n\nIf the manager is coming out to say hello to regular, he/she should also come around to tables to say 'Hello' to new patrons as well. \n\nI will definitely be coming again to try the lunch menu though.", 4], ["Food -- it was delicious! I mean, compared to other restaurants I've visited in Toronto, this one's got the 5*\n\nAmbiance -- absolutely gorgeous and quiet. Professional. There weren't a lot of people when we were there, so that might have been the reason why it was quiet. However, there was a full bar right next to us and I was surprised that I couldn't hear the noises.\n\nService -- the servers were so accommodating! A bit slow though, I wish they kept one so we could easily call them when we need them. But they were here and there once in a while so that was okay.", 5], ["Went to the restaurant with my friend last week, was impressed by the beautiful patio section. Lots of people were dinning there, and it was absolutely a very nice view of the yorkville. Enjoyed the atmosphere very much! \n\nThe food and drink were also very good, very nice presentation and very delightful, very good experience overall. \n\nWill try again for sure!", 5], ["One restaurant is Mark McEwans \"be seen\" Yorkville restaurant connected to the Hazelton hotel. When it first opened the food didn't match the hype or the expensive. This reputation, along with it's sometimes seedy clientele (think ladies of the night and the type of men who accompany them) displaced One as being in a top teir restaurant category. All though the scene can still be seedy, the people watching is fantatsic and food is incredible. Additonally, their real estate can't be matched in the summer, their patio wraps around the Yorkville / Hazelton corner and is the perfect place to enjoy a $2o omelette. Other than being extremely hard to decide what to get, I think their menu is a masterpiece. There is something for everyone. \n\nI am always impressed by the level of quality seafood. For a restaurant that doesn't specialize in seafood, it is the star of the show. My favourite dishes include, lobster carbonara, lobster rose, tuna tartare, tuna tacos, truffles fries and the side dish of beets.\n\nWhen they are busy, the service can be atrocious, especially in the summertime when they are busy. The restaurant serves Boulart bread which is fresh and usually warm. I highly recommend taking a piece if it is busy because it might be awhile until they come back and take your order.", 5], ["My husband and I arrived with our twins stroller for a late lunch and the staff treated us very kindly. The service was great and the food was of great quality. The best we've had in a long time! I had the chicken salad which was fresh and savoury. My husband had the eggs Benedict and was raving about the chefs skill. The chicken soup was like a homemade one..... The staff were very accommodating even tried to bring us toys for the babies. The wine by glass was a 2012 Chardonnay, exquisite!", 5], ["The only advantage was that one restaurant for me is that it is very close to my home. The food is good but expensive. So you are paying for location...\nI remember the servers used to be a lot friendlier before... They are still good but something has changed...\nFor the price you pay in this restaurant, you can have a better food and get the same service in a few other restaurants around.\nTry oyster as it is very fresh...", 3], ["A friend chose this place for a Summerlicious dinner catchup date, and I remember saying to her at least twice, \"Good choice!\"\n\nThey had an outdoor patio option which I opted out of, since the clouds were threatening to break open.  Walking into the Hazelton Hotel (where ONE was located) lobby, I was a little blinded by the darkness but impressed nonetheless by the spaciousness and cool decor.  It was a bit of an early dinner so the tables were mostly empty; we were seated at a nice table by the window, where we could somewhat see the patio diners through mesh curtains.\n\nOnto the food -- I decided to go with a Corn & Crab Chowder, Boneless Pork Rack, and Chocolate Cheesecake for my three courses.  My friend chose Pork Belly, Eggplant Parmesan, and Ontario Fruit Crumble.  \n\nI wish I got the pork belly too -- but didn't, since I was already having a pork entree -- because it was AMAZING!  She shared a bite with me and it was literally melt-in-your-mouth marinated.  The first impression I had was how flavourful everything was - the avocado puree, yuzu, etc. all had really strong flavours (bordering on overwhelming, but managed to stay delicious).  My chowder came in a white bowl as a clump of corn and assorted bits on the bottom; both of us were staring confusedly at this tiny portion, until the server conjured up a kettle of warm soup that he poured into the bowl.  Too bad I didn't get to record this transformation happening - it was so unexpected.\n\nMy pork entree was a little disappointing; I don't remember much about it, maybe because I was so blown away by how great my friend's eggplant tasted.  Personally, I dislike eggplant, and am a little allergic.  I could not believe they could make eggplant taste so good!  The crispy coating added just the right amount of texture, and again everything was high in flavour.  Returning to my own dish, I barely managed to finish the pork and the asparagus since we were both already full.\n\nFinishing up the meal were our desserts, which were less than spectacular.  She said the fruit crumble was not very good, and my chocolate cheesecake was just average.  It had a couple chunks of 'honey comb' (same hard candy as Crunchie bars) which I wasn't a fan of, and caramel sauce.\n\nOverall a great dining experience though; still can't get over that pork belly even a week later.  I will most likely be returning sometime in the future! :)", 4], ["One is the bar and restaurant located in the ever so nice Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville.  But don't let the fact that it's a \"hotel restaurant\" sway you to thinking this place is not grand . . .for it is just that.\n\nGiven I was a guest in the hotel- One was sort of my \"go to\" restaurant over the days that I was there.  It is open for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner and they are extremely accommodating if you want something from one menu at a different time.\n\nThe bar is dimly lit and seems to be the \"place to see and be seen\" in Yorkville as the seats at the bar were usually filled with locals who knew each other well and used the bar to catch up on that day's activities or to read the local paper.  I liked that the locals were friendly and immediately \"adopted me\" as one of their own, buying me drinks and suggesting things to do while I was in town.\n\nThe bartenders pour a good drink be it a simple Bloody Mary or a perfectly shaken martini.  They also were quick to welcome me to eat that their bar- something I availed myself of several times during my stay.\n\nAnd it didn't matter what I ordered, the food at the Mark McEwen restaurant was very good albeit simply prepared without a lot of the \"frou frou\" that so many chefs think they need today.  I sampled the fresh oysters of the day and the tuna tartar as starters- both were quick to come up and served with a smile.  My favorite thing was probably the chicken salad \"Cobb style\" as the bacon was pancetta and the dressing was a vinaigrette versus the usual overbearing blue cheese dressing.  I also had some salmon for dinner one night that was also quite tasty.\n\nAnd if you really want to indulge- have one of their excellent desserts.  I opted for the 6 freshly baked cookies and some vanilla ice cream, but the chocolate bread pudding was a close second choice.\n\nThe only thing I had that I wasn't crazy about was an omelet for breakfast as I thought the onions overwhelmed the dish and the eggs surrounding it were a bit on the gummy side.\n\nService is good although know if you are at the bar that the regulars may have your bartender's attention.\n\nToo bad I was here in the Winter and couldn't sit out on the patio.  It would have been great for people watching and breakfast outside is one of my favorite things in life.  Oh well . . .there is always the next time . .and you can bet there will be a next time!", 4]]
