I've yet to try something I didn't like.", 4], ["I would say this place is a 3.5\n\nCame here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. The location is a a bit hidden but if you see a Coca-Cola looking awning, you're in the right place. The inside is small and rustic. A very comfortable atmosphere. \n\nFood wise is was great! We ordered the Buffalina salad to share as a starter and it was delicious! For my entree I chose the Puttanesca pasta which I'm happy to say tasted authentic and very much like Italy. My boyfriend had the Prosciutto con Funghi pizza and he liked it as well. They have a very nice wine list that features wines from different regions of Italy. They also have some classic Italian cocktails and a selection of beers and other liquors. For dessert (unfortunately no photo because we dove right into it) we got the Panacotta which has a berry compote on top. AMAZING. \n\nThe service on the other hand, not great. The woman who initially served us (we think she is the owner) disappeared after we got our entrees. After finishing our entrees we waited almost 20 minutes before I had to get another waiters attention and ask for a dessert menu. The tables are all set up really close to each other, so we could hear everyone complaining about how no one was around and all their failed attempts to get someone's attention. When we ordered dessert I asked for the bill at the same time in order to avoid having to delay more, but the server left and never came back and we had to wait again for a while to get another woman's attention to finally get it. Then wait for someone to come with the machine... we did a lot of waiting. \n\nWe would still come back to try more items. They have a really nice menu with a lot of veg and non veg options. Hopefully this was a one off and next time the service will be on point!", 3], ["How was the food and experience?\nSo when it comes to the taste of the food, I think it is pretty okay. In fact, the pasta that I had(Commentatore) was pretty good. However I think the price is slightly above average, but then again considering downtown Toronto, I guess it is normal. \n\nHow was the service? (sucky service)\nTheir service was not that great. This is where I had to decrease one star otherwise I think they are easy 4 star. So we booked a reservation for 14, and yes we showed up with 2 more people. We understand the table was set up for only 14. We also know the server will eventually set a table for the rest of the guest next to us because at the time the entire restaurant is pretty much empty. Instead of just helping us get some extra seats, she started showing attitudes and said something like \"so you guys are not 14 people right? cuz you know table is only set for 14, so okay?\" \nWe get it, we showed up with 2 more people, and we are not blind, we can see there are only 14 seats, captain obvious here, like what she trying to achieve. \nI guess because for large groups of people they forced the 20% tip already, so they don't give a shit about how they treat you, so service was not that good. Would not come back here again for office events.\n\nWould I recommend?\nNO, do NOT host your office events here, waste of time, waste of money, waste of energy.", 3], ["Ordered the rosata pasta which was with smoked salmon and it was excellent. Pasta was fresh and I believe house made as the softness of the pasta was quite apparent. Smoked Salmon was great along with the accouterments. The service was a bit slow but nice homely place, I noticed the crowd included a mix of young people as well as older people which was nice. Definitely a recommendation!", 4], ["Toronto hidden gem alert! \n\nI am so glad that I have now tried this place and super sad that it only happened recently. I've been missing out! \n\nPastas are made from scratch and the pizzas are wood-fire oven. They have a really extensive variety of pastas to choose from - red sauce, cream sauce, rose sauce - you choose! My friend and I shared the lamb special and the mushroom pasta. The lamb was tender and cooked a perfect mid rare (yay!) and the pasta was rich, creamy, with the perfect amount of truffle and mushrooms.  \n\nThe service outshone everything. We were a group of 10 people dining during the dinner rush and the servers were phenomenal. Drinks and food arrived on time. Replenishing bread and condiments without asking. Split bills with zero errors. I was really impressed because I can understand how challenging it can be to manage such a large group.", 5], ["I won't say that this was a complete and utter disaster of a decision buuuut...Let's start with my biggest grip. THEY ONLY HAD FUCKIN' KETTLE ONE VODKA! SERIOUSLY?!?! So that's going to cost you a star right off the bat. The feeling you get when walking into the place is, if your young and on your first \"Fancy Date\" this is the place to come. The space is slightly cramped but doable for a person like me. I'm not going to front, with the exception of my pasta NOT being al dente, my carbonara was nearly perfect. Ut just tasted rushed. You may be asking \"What's up with that other star?\" That's because they just threw a lemon wedge in my water. SERIOUSLY. You can't ask? All in all, I barely recommend this place. It'll probably help if your a little drunk beforehand.", 3], ["I went here for a birthday with a group of 11. The entrance that my Uber dropped me off at was quite small and unassuming. It was a bit confusing where the main foyer was but a server helped me out right away. The atmosphere was quite calm on a Friday night and the decor was pale rustic palette with modern accents - very pretty. I feel like maybe this place is better for intimate gatherings rather than large parties. \n\nOur server was upbeat and seemed like he was trying his best to accommodate everyone at the table with our orders and questions. The appetizers came out within 10-15 mins and the main dishes quickly followed. \n\nI was pleased with my order but slightly disappointed because it did not seem fresh. My fungocrema seemed like it was assembled hours before and microwaved before serving. It was just a bit warmer than room temp, but this could be due to the number of dishes we ordered. The antipasto misto we ordered to start were quite good though. The only complaint my table had came from one person who ordered the spaghetti with clams - she said the clams were a bit sandy and dry. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a casual, hearty dinner and a calm atmosphere where you can hang out and chat without having to yell. It did not seem busy so you could probably get away with walking in.", 4], ["I've been here twice and absolutely love their food!\n\nIt is a little challenging to find from outside but when you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nTheir food is amazing, I recommend the seafood pasta - al dente spaghetti (which shockingly enough is hard to find in Toronto) My family had the pizza and absolutely loved it. \n\nThe place looks cozy, but not necessarily fancy - really what will have you coming back is their food.", 5], ["I wanted to try this place but was completely turned off by the attitude of the staff. I came here on a Thursday and learned that they just started offering happy hour where wine and apps were \"half off.\" Upon receiving the menu, we realized that their 5 oz wine is $6 for happy hour ($8 regular price). We asked the manager, Nick, why he was advertising half off wine when this really wasn't the case. He was incredibly rude and said \"well I can't sell a glass of wine for $4.\" We then pointed out the appetizers were not half off either given the margherita pizza is offered for $10 and the regular price is $18. When we pointed that out, Nick, the manager said, \"well it's just $1 off, what's the big deal.\" He then proceeded to ask us \"what are you guys looking for here, a deal?\" To be honest, it's not about the price at all, it's about false advertising and your attitude towards customers. Why advertise something as half off when this is not true, and when a customer points it out, become disrespectful and rude about it? Would not recommend this place to anyone.", 1], ["Small Italian restaurant with interesting decor and a patio (only a few tables though) for the summer. \n\nMenu had a large selection of pastas and pizzas, which was exactly what I was hoping for. I ordered the vongole (clam) pasta which was pretty good, but a bit too small for my preference. I would consider the dish to be on the pricey side given the quantity.\n\nService was great. My group of 8 did not need to wait long to order, have our food served, or to get the bill. \n\nOverall I would come again to try their other dishes, but it would not be a restaurant that I would regularly visit.", 4], ["We came here in search for a new Italian restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe service, ambiance and food was great. We had the Siciliana pizza and commendatore pasta. The pasta was definitely the star of the night. Once you add some red peppers in it, it was amazing- al dente, creamy, perfect combination of spicy and savoury. For desserts, we had the tiramisu. It was nice and light. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience and I'd definitely come back for the pasta!", 4], ["This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. Everything is freshly made and many ingredients are imported from Italy. \nEach pasta you order will come out piping hot and noodles are all al dente! Pizza ovens are in the open so you know when each order is made and serve. \nMy favorite pasta is the Vongole, white wine with clams spaghetti. The amount of clams you get is a lot more than other Italian restaurants, and they're fat and juicy. Same at the frutti di mare, the mussels and clams they use are all juicy and fresh. The lasagna is creamy and cheesy, so if that's you're thing, you must order it! \nThey have lots of options for appetizers, my favorite is the bufalina and beef carpaccio. Bufalina is fresh bufala mozzarella with drizzled balsamic reduction and grilled vine cherry tomatoes on top of arugula. Beef carpaccio is thinly sliced with arugula and slices of Parmesan cheese then drizzled with truffle oil. \nDon't forget to order their tiramisu, it's creamy, soft, and light! \nIf you don't like their wine selection, you can always bring your own for a corkage fee of $15. \nIt's a great homey Italian restaurant, not bougey at all. It's slight hidden, just remember to look for the Coca Cola sign on Ontario street.", 5], ["Great experience tucked away in a side street off of King. Everything was delicious and the ambiance was very romantic/intimate.", 5], ["I saw this vendor at IDS and then I had to go to the restaurant.  So I am not very much a fan of mushrooms but their  Fungocrema is AMAZING. So much flavor, rich and creamy and the mushrooms are cooked soo well. I wish I could have a bite of this now!  I was not the biggest fan of the cheesecake but the restaurant it self was great.  They really have to adjust the address though, I got dropped off at the wrong location.", 5], ["Wonderful surprise! Great italien restaurant! The pizza were very good and the pesto pasta incredible!

Had pizza, salad and eggplant panini, excellent, all was freshly made with the best ingredients", 5], ["From the beginning we were treated like a nuisance, apparently because we hadn't booked. We came later in the evening and it wasn't busy - the outdoor area was maybe half full, but they wouldn't seat us out there because we hadn't booked. She said there was a table inside that they had to clean off, so we sat for about 5 minutes or so and then were seated. \n\nWhen we were done eating nobody came to offer dessert or coffee (which we wanted), or even just to give us our check, for at least 10 minutes after the busser had cleared our plates. During this period of time, our server stopped a few times at another table to talk to the women seated there, and had spent several minutes just sitting at the bar. We ended up going to the register to get our bill. We weren't drinking alcohol, so maybe that was why he didn't seem to care about our experience there. \n\nThe woman who had initially seated us apologized, saying that they were very busy and understaffed. Again, by this point, the restaurant was less than half full, and our server had been talking to women at other tables and sitting at the bar during the period of time that we were waiting for our check. \n\nWhen I think back on the evening, I'm really annoyed at myself because I still tipped him 15%, because I was always taught to tip at least 20, so at the moment I felt like I was making a statement. In reality, though, he just got to feel like he'd gotten away something. Incompetence doesn't bother me; I've never written a bad review or under-tipped because some well-intentioned person just isn't very good at their job. I'm this case, it's the disrespect that drives me to say something. \n\nThat said, the pasta was cooked very well, so that was nice. Note that there is no option for ordering chicken or salmon to add to a pasta, because they apparently only offer that option at lunch. It may be that that's more authentically Italian or something, but I was craving pasta, and also really would've liked to have some protein with dinner.", 2], ["Ambience - really cozy and casual, a great place to have a nice dinner & be able to talk\n\nService - good!\n\nFood - I'll start with the bad. They serve some pretty terrible bread as the starter. I mean, I get it's free, but you're an Italian restaurant, have some GOOD bread! It was stale, hard, and lacked flavour. Worse than day-old bread from grocery store!\n\nI ordered the BUFALINA salad (roasted cherry tomatoes / balsamic reduction / bufala mozzarella arugola / basil / x-v oil $22) which was PARTLY disappointing. The bufala mozzarella was creamy, rich  & delicious, BUT it was served atop way too much arugula, which sat on top of MORE of that stale sliced bread! \n\nThe entrees though, were SPECTACULAR. We were a group of 7 that ordered 4 pasta dishes, 2 pizzas, and 1 salmon entree that was on the daily special. We only disliked the one salmon dish which was bland, dry, and overcooked. But really, if you're going to an Italian restaurant, you really should be ordering pizza or pasta! Shame on them lol. \n\nAll of the pasta dishes were delightful - perfectly executed and FULL of flavour. We ordered the FUNGOCREMA, COMMENDATORE and PUTTENESCA. All great, but the first 2 were stand out dishes. The 4th pasta dish was a lasagna from the daily special which was top notch too!\n\nTheir pizza is also done really well. The crust is airy, but chewy, and perfectly crisp.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend Mangia & Bevi and will definitely be returning soon!", 5], ["I was looking for a new Italian restaurant around the Distillery District and this low key place came up on several review sites, including Yelp.

Inside is quite dark, but it has a sort of rustic ambiance.  The menu offers a good selection of pizzas and pastas and even charges nothing for gluten-free options.\n\nI have come here twice now, and both times I have had an enjoyable experience. I have tried the Fruti de Mare (seafood) and the Commendatore (sausauge, provolone, cream) pasta dishes. Firstly the Fruti de Mare included many types of seafood and a reasonable portion of homemade pasta. The tomato sauce was not overpowering and complemented the seafood by bringing out its flavour.  The Commendatore was equally delicious. The pasta was al dente and had just the right chewiness. The sauce was simple, but was extremely flavourful. \n\nWill come back again and again.", 5], ["Pasta is great!!!!!!

The did provide some condiments and boy those chili flakes pack a punch and will give you a kick if you like your food hot. \nThe pasta which I tried a bit was a surprise. I generally avoid having pasta outside but this one is worth trying out. Light yet highlighting the core ingredients. \nThis place is worth a detour if you like Italian food.\n4 Stars.\nUpdate second trip elevated this place's position on the good pizza in the city/\nThis time we wisely selected less saltier pizzas and they were just right.\nDessert hmm Panna Cotta was decent Tiramisu was below average (not recommended)", 4], ["Surprising to see everyone rating the pizza so high. Way overrated - I'd give 5/10 at best. For the price I paid ($22), the pizza is 1/10. The pizza literally had tomato sauce, cheese, and wild boar sausage only. The dough is comparable to the ones you get at pizza pizza. The server was friendly until she realized that we weren't getting any alcoholic beverages with the pizza. For beer, they only have steam whistle and stella on tap, and they're $9 each. It also seems like they reuse the chilli dips that come with the pizza & I'm sure some people double dip into those without using the spoon that comes with it. Extremely overpriced mediocre food - don't come here. \n\n+1 star for location & patio decor.", 2], ["Love the thin crust pizza but it was a bit too thin and didn't hold the toppings well. That said, the actual crust was one of the handful of crusts that I ate at any pizza place. Good atmosphere except for the large coat rack in the back room and lack of authentic music. Very good service. Great bread with olive oil and balsamic served before meal. Would return to try the pasta.", 4], ["I tried their brunch sampler menu the other day. It's pretty hard to find as it's hidden inside an office building. The restaurant in itself isn't too shabby. It's a bit small so if you have a big group, you're probably going to be really cramped together.\n\nI tried their pizza which was delicious, extremely thin crust which I liked. Their sandwiches were also really good. I have no idea what they did to it but the crispiness combined with the bacon and sauce just made it soooo good. I also got to try their french toast which was ok. Nothing too special about it. Out of everything I tried, I actually liked their sandwiches the most.\n\nThis place is probably best to hit if you want a casual lunch/brunch. Just remember, their brunch is only available on Saturdays.", 4], ["Tucked away in the corner of Ontario and King, this place is truly a hidden gem. The service for starters is impeccable; very attentive and our orders came quickly. They also start you off with complimentary bread which is very nice, but the real show stopper is the pizza!

My favourite was definitely the brisket - it was cooked to absolute perfection and the meat was super tender. Flavours all around were on point. I will say that the serving sizes of everything could have been bigger.

There is a nice patio which is a plus.\n\nWe ordered a variety of meats. The beef brisket was tender, but too bland. The beef ribs were had some flavour, but these were too dry. The sausage was mediocre and juiceless. I can get better at the grocery store. The baby back ribs and the side ribs were also bland, too dry, and hard. Our total was over $100. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend coming over here unless perhaps you're drunk from partying at Rebel, especially for their prices.", 2], ["For all you meataholics this is the place for you. It's a no frills restaurant but the meat is good. I tried their brisket & some of their sides (cornbread, home fries). The beef brisket was so delicious. Cooked perfectly in my opinion. It was tender & easy to cut. This bbq sauce on the table was watered down. You gotta have a good bbq sauce if you're a bbq restaurant! That's one thing that disappointed me. The corn bread was good & so were the home fries. Food gets delivered on a metal tray on paper plates & containers. We used plastic cutlery for everything. Waitstaff were fine. We got the food quickly. But I think the kitchen was prepared for us because we were a large group. We took up most of the seats in the restaurant at about 20 people. Besides the bbq they also have alcoholic drinks for those that imbibe. \n\nDecor is pretty basic. Some wooden top tables with red metal chairs. Front counter is where you order & the base had mismatched wood which looks neat. The bar was on the right side. Seating is squishy in this place. It's not that big a restaurant. Washrooms are downstairs & okay looking. It's not the ritz but it was clean. \n\nI don't like this location because for me it's far from everything. The only way to get here besides by car is by bus two lines run nearby but not often. The 121 bus runs every 15 minutes. I feel like I'm out in the boonies. If I lived in the neighbourhood that might be different. We came here because we did a team building event just around the corner at Batl Axe Throwing. Needless to say since I don't live near here & I'm not often in the area I wouldn't likely eat here again. They have a location at Richmond & York in the assembly chefs hall which is much more accessible for me. I'll try that location in the future.", 4], ["An amazing smoke house and amongst my favourite in the city. Everything on the menu was great from the brisket to the ribs.

My friends and I ordered the wings, brisket and quarter chicken with mac & cheese, potato salad and fries to munch on. Everything was tender, moist and seasoned well. We were fighting over the thick brisket just because how it just fell off our forks and how good it tasted. \n\nThe pickled radish that came with the entrees were a nice added touch. The restaurant feature a nice bar with plenty of wine and beer to choose from. We really enjoyed our food here and felt the prices were reasonable. This is definitely a great lunch spot to grab something quick and catch some games while you are at. Parking is limited with side street parking. I'll definitely be back to try their pork and rib entrees!", 5], ["We always wanted to check this place out and we're all glad we did!! A great outdoor patio to hang out to eat and drink. The choices of BBQ'D meats are wonderful.I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Mac & Cheese, BBQ Beans and Corn Bread. We also ordered the BBQ ribs and some drinks. The ladies tried the Peach Cobbler and I had the  lemonade. Our meal was totally amazing. I wasn't a fan of the Mac/Cheese because it was a creamy type. I prefer a thick and more solid M/C. That's Just me. The Peach Cobbler Drink was nice but it was more on the sour side. It need some simple syrup or peach schnapps  to give it a more Peach flavor. We all shared a Banana Pudding. They ran out of the Bourbon Pudding ! The staff was so so friendly and helpful. Thank you for a great meal .", 4], ["Stopped in here for dinner before the leafs game, and damn... completely worth it\n\nTook a gamble because I'd never really heard much about this spot, but it was fantastic.\n\nWe got the 1/2 rack ribs, 1/2lbs turkey and 1/2lbs brisket. The ribs were awesome, and the brisket was fantastic. It was so juicy. \n\nThe turkey was good too, not OVERLY moist but they served it with a sort of garlic sauce and it turned out to be one of my favourite parts.\n\nOverall, solid BBQ for Canada. Well done.", 4], ["We went on a Sunday afternoon and they were short staffed, so we had to wait for a long time (about 30 minutes) to get the food.  Annoyingly so, which wasn't really their problem, there was a fly that kept circling around us... so it added to the frustration.  If not because of the long wait (and probably the fly), I would probably give 4 stars.\n\nThe food was good.  We had some chicken wings and pork ribs.  Both were cooked to perfection.  We also had the crispy cauliflower, a must-have; potato salad, real mashed potato and I really liked it; coleslaw, not the type I like as it's a bit too sour; and home fries, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nI think I will go again in the winter so there would be no fly....", 3], ["Easily best bbq in Toronto\nAnd there is now finally some good bbq in TO \nThe city will discover as it builds to the lake and cherry street area \nevery thing on menu is excellent !\nAnd you think \nI need to be here again soon \nYou simply don't feel that way about a lot of bbq places \nAnd even the place has a good or great item other choices not good for others \nThis is an A all around \nAnd fun atmosphere after or before a day downtown", 5], ["Service was nice, as for the food....I've been to a lot better places for BBQ.

I don't fully understand the reasoning behind the plastic wrap but we'll move on. I found the meat was tender but quite dry and lacking in flavour. The coleslaw was vinegar based and was very generic.", 2], ["Solid bbq. I only had the spicy BBQ wings but between all of us we tried home fries, mac n cheese, and fried cauliflower (the winner) for sides. The wings packed some moderate heat - note don't rub your eye even after you've washed your hands! But the were delicious, big, & saucy. The Mac & cheese was good but nothing to write home about. Home fries were just chunks of fried potato with a mayo (chipotle?) dip. The fried cauliflower was seriously the best fried cauliflower I have ever had though! And everyone at the table agreed. Two other friends had a brisket sandwich and agreed it was also very good. Yummy all around, especially if you don't want to pay the crazy prices for food at nearby venues!", 4], ["Came here on a Tuesday night, early dinner around 6pm and there were still bar seats available with no wait. It was never fully packed the whole night we were there although it did get busier. It is tricky to get to without a car. \n\nNot the best bbq ever but good for Toronto. Got the beef brisket, tender and not chewy at all. The hard rack ribs were also good and not dry. I wish everything had more sauce though, they had a bottle of sauce on the side which does help. Mac and cheese side was also good but not amazing, creamy and saucy but needed more flavor.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and my friend had smoked wings. The pulled pork was excellent and my side of cauliflower was also well prepared. I tried the wings from my friend and the smokiness was very tasty and a nice twist on wings (I'm not a fan at baseline but those were good). Good beer menu and full bar.

Nice large patio and friendly staff. We ordered ribs, brisket and chicken sandwich along with coleslaw, potato salad and mac n'  cheese as sides. The chicken sandwich was excellent generous portion moist smokey breast of chicken.\nThe ribs were somewhat under-smoked and were tough. No sauce. Replacement ribs were marginally better. Any BBQ joint in the the southern US has much better ribs. The brisket was delicious, but one small slab that may have been 8 ounces when the cow was alive! Served with a bit of onion and jalape\u00f1o. No sauce.  The beef was served with 2 slices of Wonder Bread. (Why bother?). The slaw was decent. The mac n cheese was watery and tasteless.

The restaurant is fairly small and narrow, and very dimly lit. The tables are cramped and the atmosphere lit by eerie red lights, with moderately loud music playing in the background.\n\nMy friend and I shared the vegetarian platter along with an order of doro wat, a stewed chicken in spices with a boiled egg. The injera (sour flatbread with holes and bubbles) was a good vessel for scooping up the food, and its sour taste was fairly penetrating. There were some interesting vegetarian sides, mostly consisting of potatoes, lentils, beans, or cabbage in stewed or mashed form. The veggies were lighter and a great palate cleanser. \n\nThe doro wat, however, was fairly disappointing. There was a potent mixture of spices, making it very difficult to pinpoint any one flavour. There was also a measly one piece of drumstick - I had expected more meat, and it was quite impossible to share the drumstick in bone among two people. \n\nOverall, a nice and interesting meal, but definitely not the most tasty Ethiopian I've ever had.", 3], ["Nice Jazz music!

Coming in on a Sunday night, I didn't know what to expect! The restaurant was quite full with lots of local Toronto Ethiopians. It was neat that the servers brought out a pan of roasting coffee beans and walked it around the entire restaurant which gave it a very smokey & earthy vibe. The servers were also very attentive.\n\n//THE FOOD//\nWe ordered a VEGETARIAN PLATTER to share amongst 3 of us. The servers also asked how many of us were sharing to ensure there was enough food for everyone. It came out on huge plate with a large injera (Ethiopian flatbread) under a colourful circle of veggie sides. It included mashed/stewed lentils, chickpeas, potatoes, beets, carrots, collard greens, split peas, cabbage, and tomato salad. It was so exciting to try each side because it was always a surprise of what the flavours, spiciness, and textures would be!\n\nThey also served 3 additional flatbreads on the side so you can tear it apart and use to scoop up the food to eat. The flatbreads were like nothing I've tried before...it tasted like sourdough, but in a squishy thick crepe form. It also had a spongey bubbly texture that was great for soaking up all the sauces from the side dishes (yay!) but it would also easily disintegrate with how soggy it got (boo). \n\nAlong with our vegetarian platter, we ordered some meats which they piled in the middle of our platter. We had the AWAZE TIBS (stewed lamb), DORO TIBS (cubed saut\u00e9ed chicken), and CHA CHA (charboiled beef). My absolute favourite was the lamb, it was so tender & marinated with the special Ethiopian mix of herbs & spices, and the juices that seeped out of it was finger-licking good! My 2nd favourite was the chicken, it was also seasoned well and moist. The beef was disappointing as it was tough & dry, and the cook on it was borderline burnt. \n\n//OVERALL//\nThis was my first time having Ethiopian food and I enjoyed every bite of it! It's a shame that the restaurant is so dark, so I couldn't fully appreciate all the vibrant colours of our dishes.

Both were about $14/each. We had so much food we grabbed some to go!  \n\nService was okay but really friendly. Our food took 30 minutes to arrive.

They also do a lovely coffee ceremony (and yes, the coffee is excellent and strong); just be sure to notify them when you order your meal if you want to have one later.

I'm happy I went with mango, I felt like it needed something sweet, without it, it would have been lacking in something, but that's just my opinion, I love sweet and savory combinations in food. Lastly, you choose your sauce and garnishes, I went with all the garnishes, which includes scallions, sesame seeds, radish to name a couple and the spicy mayo.

It might trip you out that you have to turn into a gas station and then walk into this hole in the wall no heat no ac front of the restaurant that looks deserted before you end up in this quaint cozy small back end dining room. We always joke about the experience the first time we came on the date. I now call this gas station Thai food as a joke . I remember coming in the summer time and the back dining room was packed however, they had no ac at all and we were sweating through our meal. This time we came in the dead of winter and it was so cold they didn't have fully functioning heat. Instead they had heater fans blowing in different corners of the room. I was actually quite cold during our meal.\n\nFood wise, I've had their green curry with chicken and pad prik chicken. Both dishes had great flavour. Only thing was, the rice I got with my green curry was on the mushier side - too wet and overcooked. Last night I tried their pad Thai with beef and my boyfriend ordered their Khao Soi with chicken. The khao soi was delicious. Very coconutty. The pad Thai was so yummy as well! The only thing that I was disappointed in was that the beef was extremely overcooked in the pad Thai. Prices are decent overall.", 4], ["Love the decor and interior. \n\nYou can totally have a large group in the back with the mural. Love the service & family run business. \n\nWe ordered: \nKhao Soi with Beef \nKub Khao Fried Rice with Chicken\n\nFood was delicious! Generous portions too. You can choose your spice levels accordingly.\n\nService is at times slow but I love this place too much to reduce the star rating. Hidden GEM! Hidden behind a gas station and looks kinda sketch but it isn't!!", 5], ["A great hidden gem behind a gas station in Scarborough. You could definitely miss it. However, when you enter, you know that it's going to be good by how packed it is! For a place that's so hidden, the turnout is definitely a testament to how great the food is. \n\nFood is always consistently delicious. \n1) We get the pad prik chicken which satisfies my curry craving and my fried chicken craving. It's fried chicken pieces tossed in a red curry type sauce, served with jasmine rice. Sooooooo good!\n2) Good old pad Thai - can't complain, generous portion and well made. Not like other places I've been that douse their pad thai in ketchup. \n3) I've also had the satay and curry puffs - both delicious apps. \n\nGenerous portions and quick service, perhaps not the best service, but quick. Sometimes good food can excuse mediocre service in my books. Very reasonable prices - two can dine for dinner for under $50.", 5], ["Well, this was an interesting experience. \n\nEver since my introduction to Khao Soi at another restaurant, I've been craving it and trying to find somewhere a little closer to home where I could have it. \n\nI found this restaurant on Yelp and it had a great rating so I figure, met, why not? After all, I trust my fellow Yelpers!\n\nEveryone in this joint was so pleasant and the food was great. I ordered the Khao Soi of course and my husband had a spicy beef salad. Both dishes were fantastic. \n\nService was a little slow but they were quite busy so that's easily forgiven. \n\nMy only issue with this place was the cleanliness. We were sat in stools so there wasn't anywhere to put our jackets and I didn't want to put it in any of the surfaces. The table was also quite dirty and sticky. Kind of gross to touch. \n\nWould I eat here again? Likely not but the food was really good, it's just a shame about the conditions.", 3], ["This place is FIRE. Great flavourful food with cool atmosphere (back room). We had the roasted duck curry (with lychee!), smoked chili shrimp fried rice, and tom  kha gai soup ... and every single dish was bursting with flavour. medium-spicy level was a bit spicy for me but I still ate everything happily.", 5], ["Came here for lunch on a Saturday.\n\nThis store is located behind a gas station so can be easy to miss. There's free parking on either side of the gas station. \n\nWe were seated fairly quickly.  \n\nEnvironment: We did notice the bench seating was quite dirty, lots of black marks permanently in the fabric.  Looks like they may need to re-upholster the benches with easier to clean material.  The wooden table surface was also kind of sticky still when we sat down.  Not sure if we were coming on the tail of a lunch rush or if this is status quo.  \n\nFood: Got the lunch pad Thai chicken special and khao soi beef.\n\nThe lunch specials come with a small side of mango salad and 3 crispy wontons. Mango salad was very fresh and had a great mixture of flavors - mangos, red onions, red peppers, peanuts, fish sauce, mint and cilantro. Very well executed.  The crispy wontons were also really good - very light but crispy exterior.  The inside seemed to be some sort of minced chicken - it was okay but didn't get much flavor out of it.  \n\nPad Thai chicken was made fresh - piping hot when it came to our table.  Has rice noodles, chicken, few pieces of deep fried tofu, egg and bean sprouts. Just note that the bean sprouts come on the one side of the dish raw - if you want them cooked, give them a heads up.  Overall, the pad Thai was good but I felt it was a little on the sweet side. Interestingly, they put diced pieces of preserved vegetables (?) which gives it a slight salty kick every so often.  Portion is generous for lunch price.  Wish it had more deep fried tofu pieces though!\n\nKhao soi beef was very good. Very rich curry coconut flavor, loved the contrast of the wet noodles against the dry, crispy noodles.  The beef they use seems to be a very lean stewing beef - it's really good but wish they used a cut with a little more fat but I suspect because the sauce is so rich, it's okay with the leaner meat.  There were also onion slices and preserved vegetable slices.  We did notice we got a few large chunks of onions instead of slices. Looks like they were doing half moon slices and we perhaps got some end pieces which ended up being very raw - we were okay with it but I know others who hate raw onions.  Not sure if there's a quality assurance issue prior to food coming out. \n\nPortions here are super generous for what you pay.  We definitely brought home 25% of leftovers and we were full. \n\nPrice: Really great price for lunch special (under 10$ before tax and tip).  Khao soi was about 15$ before tax and tip.  \n\nService was okay - don't think anyone checked in on us after food was served and we did notice that the pad Thai came out a good 15 min before the khao soi.\n\nKub khao's food is a solid 3.5/5 but got dinged by un-cleanliness and lack of quality control.  Great place for affordable Thai food if you overlook the environment.", 3], ["Must try ! \nBe aware parking is limited.\nBy the time when I got in to the restaurant.

I particularly love that their \"lunch specials\" are offered every day of the week (including weekends) because they're affordable, the food is tasty, and the portions are very fair. \n\nMy go-to order is chicken pad thai. For only $9.99, you get the entree along with 3 deep-fried wontons and the choice of a sweet and sour soup or a mango salad. What a steal! I can never finish the entire pad thai by myself so it makes for a good take-home second meal! I've also tried their chicken pineapple curry, khao soi, and grilled chicken with sticky rice. All of the dishes have been tasty and I'm happy with the consistency of the food I get every time I come. \n\nA big plus is that this place isn't too far away from the 401 either so I'm always happy to drop by for some Thai food whenever I'm passing by the area!", 4], ["A solid 3.5 stars.\n\nCame with a group and ordered a few dishes:\n\nDeep fried shrimp donuts - perfectly fried and chewy, comes with a nice sweet chili sauce\n\nBeef larb - a great appetizer to start, loved the acidity from the lime and the hint of fish sauce - super refreshing \n\nShrimp pad thai - a good dish, the noodles were slightly mushy but great flavor \n\nChicken khao soi - done well and one of the fave dishes that I tried here\n\nSoft shell crab curry - couldn't really taste the soft shell crab as the flavors overpowered it a bit, but still a very good dish \n\nThai milk tea - the perfect sweetness! Typically it's overly sweet at restaurants but this was a perfect balance of sweetness\n\nOverall a pretty solid place for Thai food uptown. My fave spot in Toronto is still Sukhothai on Parliament downtown, but this is a great spot and will definitely satisfy your cravings. Will definitely be back.", 3], ["It is nice to have an authentic Thai eatery close to where I live and in Scarborough. Parking can be hard to find in this plaza as there aren't many available.

It has an old rustic feel to the place.\n\nI have been here for dinner and lunch and recommend lunch more because of their lunch selections.\n\nI usually order the chicken pad thai with medium spicy ($9.95) lunch special and it comes with a mango salad and three fried wontons. We also ordered the shrimp karee, and the curry's before which were both delicious.\n\nThe pad thai is good, it had a nice smoky flavour to it, not too sweet and hints of thai chilli's and lime. It tasted pretty standard for a pad thai if you are craving the dish. I have definitely had better pad thai elsewhere, but this one isn't bad. \n\nThe thai ice tea was good as well but I wish the tea taste was deeper/darker. It taste a little watered down, but still good for a quick fix.\n\nOverall a decent thai place to go to!", 3], ["We came here for lunch on a weekend. It was really busy, and if it's your first time here, it reminds you of a hole in the middle all restaurant! Its right by a no name gas station, and when you first walk in, we waited to be seated.

The mango salad is refreshing, but the mangoes aren't really sweet, and comes with cilantro and some lettuce. The soup is really nice. Lots of vegetables, a slight spice, but the tang is so nice. if you like sour things, this soup is really refreshing on the taste buds!\n\nMy husband got the Pad Karee shrimp, it was curry with a couple of big shrimps, and rice. The curry was really fragrant, and not too spicy!\n\nThe Pad Thai was nice, peanuts and bean sprouts on the side to mix in. The portion is perfect for lunch, especially with the free appetizers that come with the lunch special. It was overly saucy, and delightful with a squeeze of fresh lime!\n\nThe service isn't too bad, they're very busy on the weekends, so you have to wave someone down to order or get the bill. They input your order through iPad to the kitchen.\n\nWe came back another weekday for lunch and my husband got the pad woo Sen beef. The glass noodles are very thin, so the flavours totally soak in, there is many beef pieces, but that's kinda it. so it's kinda plain as a dish. It comes with mushrooms and carrots and onions, but they weren't very noticeable.\n\nWe will come back and try their Khao Soi one day, it seems very popular.", 4], ["I'm constantly lamenting the absence of any great Thai places in my neighborhood - Yonge and Eglinton - but at least now I know there's a top-notch joint near my work.\n\nI was invited to lunch at Kub Khao on a recent workday and after perusing some of the reviews here, my excitement definitely grew steadily.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nThey've got a \"Quick Lunch\" section on their menu, so I decided to go with the Pad Thai Chicken (\"Rice Noodles, Eggs, Tofu, Bean Sprouts, Chives, Tamarind Sauce, Ground Peanut\"), and I asked for it spicy.\n\nWhile I wouldn't quite say it's the best pad thai in the city - that honor still belongs to Khao San Road - I would definitely argue that this is a clear contender for a Top Five Thai Restaurants in Toronto list.\n\nThis is one delicious plate of Pad Thai. Everything works; the noodles are cooked well, the various components are perfect, and the sauce is exactly what you want it to be. (Is there anything worse than an overly sweet pad thai sauce? This is definitely not that.) The spice level was on point, too.\n\nThe meal also came with very tasty wontons and an above average salad. The total cost for this phenomenal meal? $9.95! Ridiculous.\n\nI'll definitely be returning to try some of their other offerings, although with pad thai this good, it'll be hard to eat anything else.", 5], ["After so many recommendations to Kub Khao, I finally made my way here and I'm happy to say that it is definitely worth the hype! \n\nWe were seated at the back where it's more spacious with more tables and cute decor.

He even reached that perfect timing where when we asked for a bit more time with the menu, he came back right when we decided what to order!! Hahah \n\nI got the chicken platter that you see in all the pictures. The portions were well sized and I even had enough for lunch the next day! For $18, you truly do get a lot of food. The papaya salad was fresh and the grilled chicken was amaaaaazing. My recommendation is to put the papaya and chicken in the shrimp chip and it eat it like a mini taco! \n\nIf you ever doubt their authenticity, my friend had just come back from Thailand and had ordered the pad Thai and iced Thai tea. She said it was definitely comparable to what they serve across the ocean! \n\nDef coming back!", 4], ["I've come a few times for take out and have always enjoyed the food. Today I came in to try their lunch combos. \n\nUpon entering, their main counter is to the left and some tables to the right. They also have additional seating in the back of the restaurant. \n\nServers are always friendly and polite and today was no exception. It seemed a bit disorganized and messy with storage items in the back but it wasn't dirty so it wasn't a big deal to me. \n\nWe ordered fresh veggie rolls, grilled chicken sticky rice, grilled pork sticky rice and a Thai iced coffee. \n\nThe fresh veggie rolls comes with two rolls stuffed with lettuce, vermicelli noodles, tofu and carrots. You're given two dipping sauces. One was a sweet satay peanut sauce and the other was a spicy, sweet, and sticky fish sauce. The rolls were nicely wrapped and fresh. The dipping sauces were good too. Wish I wasn't such a spice wimp! The fish sauce one was tasty but too spicy for me. It had a sharp tart and sweet flavour that hides the spicy after punch. The satay peanut sauce was nicely balanced between the two flavours. \n\nMy grilled chicken lunch combo came with a lot of chicken! I was surprised by the amount. It was a good sized portion. It was all dark and juicy meat. The only downside was that I felt it lacked a good grill/char taste. The skin tasted and had mostly a boiled-like texture. It came with a small dish of sticky rice and a tamarind fish sauce. They heat the rice bowls so they're piping hot. That helps keep your rice at a pretty good temperature during your meal. I personally would have preferred more tamarind flavour in the dipping sauce. So I kept using the satay peanut sauce instead. \n\nThe grilled pork was very good! Juicy meat with a great grill/char taste. I'm normally a chicken over pork kind of person but I definitely preferred their grilled pork over their grilled chicken. (Due to the lack of grill/char taste to their chicken). \n\nTheir Thai iced coffee was delicious! Perfect combo of coffee and condensed milk. \n\nI enjoyed myself overall and will continue to keep coming here!", 4], ["They made the best pad thai I've ever had!! Only downside is that they're a bit understaffed here and their mango sticky rice, which I was really excited for, was very underwhelming. \n\nThe restaurant itself is located in an awkward area... right behind a gas station. But the plaza doesn't get too busy so parking isn't much of an issue. The inside is a lot nicer and felt clean. It's nicely decorated with warm ambiance and the noise level was nice too (a good inbetween). \n\nI did find that they were short on staff. The food felt like it took a little longer to come, but still in a timely manner I'd say. You typically need to wave a server down because they're always pretty busy tending to different things that they don't really check up on you otherwise. I did notice that they were attentive though. For instance, when we asked if we could order, the server came back with a new jar of water for the table as well. \n\nI was highly impressed by the pad thai. I was sceptical of getting pad thai because I feel like you can't really go wrong with pad thai that it would probably be nothing special. But I did notice a difference in quality from other places. When it came, the noodles were a shade of brown that differs from the typical reddish orange I'm used to. Don't let that deceive you; the flavour was spot on great and they gave good proportions of everything else (bean sprout: tofu: noodle ratio). You have to pay an additional $2 for protein. They're not super generous with the protein portion but it fit balanced with the ratio of other stuff. I also really liked how their tofu and chicken was bite sized.\n\nThe mango sticky rice was another story... it was disappointing. Not worth the additional $7.95. I felt it was too liquidy and too heavily soaked in coconut milk. I was expecting the rice to have more of a thick texture, but it just tasted like rice in coconut milk; not much else to it? The mangoes were pretty fresh, but definitely didn't feel it was worth it.\n\nI would come back again to try more of their entrees because the pad thai was a solid 5/5. It is a pretty small space though so it's best to make a reservation.", 3], ["Last weekend was Thai New Year. What better way to celebrate than with some Thai food. \nAppetizers like shrimp donuts  & chicken satay.  \nWe then feasted on Pad Thai, Khao Soi beef just to name a few. \nHappy belly, happy life!\nThe food here was delicious. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nThe place at first looked really small when you walk in, but the I realized that there is more tablea down the hall in the back.

We ordered the Khao Soi, Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mao. We were brought the Pad See Ew instead of the Pad Kee Mao and had to tell the waitress it was the wrong dish. She was nice enough to correct the order and brought us the correct dish and left us with both dishes to enjoy. However, the pad Thai was not as flavourful and was more on the bland side. When we got it the first time it came spicy but we found out that was a mistake. Other than that, the Khao Soi was delicious.", 3], ["I came here after craving Thai food and hearing that they're sister restaurants with Sukhothai. Not familiar with the area, I was surprised to find they're located right beside a gas station! I don't mean beside like the next building over - I mean beside like they're in the spot where the gas station convenience store should've sat. Confusing, a little dangerous on the approach to the front door, but fairly comfortable and nicely decorated inside. Definitely reminded me of other Northern Thai places with the pop art murals and modern/Asian fusion d\u00e9cor (those round straw fishermen hats as lamp shades?). If you've made a reservation, head on to the back of the shop - it's likely your table is back there. The \"front\" desk is for takeout, a bit confusing on first visit.\n\nThe menu was simple enough and had all your expected Thai favourites - noodles, curries, fried rice, appetizers. My table went with chicken wontons to start, then we each got either a curry or khao soi. It took a while for food to arrive, but the server came by to inform us they'd run out of beef and needed to offer an alternative - so that probably contributed to wait time. The chicken wontons came first - they were tasty, mostly fried wontons wrappers with about 10% chicken filling. Not bad in the way fried things never go wrong to satisfy a craving, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThen our food started to show up. Slowly. One curry after another...to the point we were sure one of the orders got dropped or served incorrectly away. When it all finally showed up we were all pretty satisfied - the curries were rich in flavour, the coconut rice was coconutty but not too sweet, and the portions were a good size. The khao soi was not as good as hoped (comparison to Yorkville's Sabai Sabai) given the sauce wasn't as rich and flavourful. I had no complaints about my red curry, though I do wish it was more aromatic and slightly richer. All in all, a satisfying meal that was at a good price point, but not outstanding Thai food.\n\nIf you're in the area, this could be a great place - they're a bit small so get a reservation in to secure your spot! Lots of takeout orders, so clearly a favorite for the locals. I'll keep them in mind if I'm in the area, but if you're looking for a Thai experience I'd consider other notable names deeper into the downtown core, or their sister restaurant.", 3], ["The food was good but not amazing, service was also not great as the restaurant was quite crowded. 3/5\n\nI ordered the Suki Yalki with pork. They have quite good portion sizes. I found the spice in my dish hid any other flavours though. Another person at my table ordered the Pad Thai that came with a lime wedge and I squeezed it on mine as I found the dish needed the lime acidity and freshness to cut through the spice and brighten the flavours \n\nAlso had the Thai iced coffee which was quite good and standard.\n\nPlace was slightly hard to find and is quite small so be sure the make a reservation. Decor was minimal and unimpressive \nRestaurant was completely full (there are less than 20 tables) and the service was not amazing. Had to call the waiters over to take our order as well as bring us an extra glass as one spot was missing one.They should hire more waiters as the two waiters that were there were literally running around.", 3], ["Over the last few months, I've been here a few more times than I should. My food baby concurs! What I love about this place is the quality and fabulousness for Scarborough standards. On the outside, it seems pretty shabby as it's located next to a gas station and found within a rundown plaza. Wait until you get inside. My recommendation is to go to the back where there's more seating and better decor. Mind you they didn't have AC, so it was humid in the summer.\n\nAside from how it looks, the food is also top notch. The serving sizes are decent for the price. I've tried and enjoyed the shrimp chips, tom yum soup, pad kee mao, and red curry. My favourite dish is the khao soi with chicken. People may be on the fence about this one because there were pickles in it, but I personally liked it. Pineapple curry chicken is also a winner. \n\nThey have lunch specials of select menu items that come with tom yum soup or mango salad and chicken wontons. Definitely can't beat the price on that. Lunch specials run from 11 am - 3 pm.\n\nIn terms of beverages, the thai iced tea is a good choice if you want a cool, refreshing drink. However, I do not recommend the Thai iced coffee as it tasted a lot like sweetened instant coffee.\n\nThe one stickler is that service can be really slow and there is usually only one waitress. I've had to motion to her for when I want to order or pay for the bill at every visit, which can be slightly annoying.\n\nIf you want a nice place for Scarborough standards with stylish food and decor, then I suggest visiting here!", 4], ["We are vacationing this week in Toronto and we're looking for a restaurant to have dinner.

I said, \"What?!? There's a good Thai restaurant in scarborough?!\" I couldn't believe it. \n\nAnyway, as I pulled up to the sketchy plaza it was in, a smile came across my face. As most of you know, good Pho restaurants are normally located in ghetto plazas too. So I had a glimmer of hope. \n\nWe walked through the front doors, and yup, it seemed a bit ghetto, but they told us to have a seat in the back. Another pleasant surprise; it was actually nice back there. They had some Thai style paintings, art and decor in the back which was a nice touch. I'm not sure why the front does not look cohesive though. \n\nAnyway, I've been here a couple of times now and we were able to order on and off the lunch menus. Everything was good! Curries, rice, noodles, appetizers. No one had a complaint. Can't beat home cooked, but it's pretty darn close. \n\nThe one thing that did disappoint me was Thai iced coffee (-1 Star). It tasted like garbage, instant coffee. Bleh, I won't order another beverage from here. Which is unfortunate. \n\nHowever, I will be back for the food. I'll be back here with my lunch crew.

They didn't even add lemongrass, which I think it's the basic of the Tom yum soup. also, quite water down. \n- Not spicy enough. Actually, it wasn't even spicy  \n- Overall: if you're craving for some sweet vegetable soup, go for it. I would even say Thai Express has tastier Tom yum than this. \n\nPineapple fried rice: \n- Soft and soggy rice\n- How do you call this pineapple fried rice if you only put 2 pieces of pineapple in this? \n- My partner usually has low expectations for food and is easily pleased. You know the food is really bad, like REALLY bad, if he's not satisfied. \nOverall: I'd say, buy a can of pineapple and fried some rice at home than to order this. \n\nKhao Soi:\n- The best dish out of all that we ordered. It's decent. I think Jatujak has better Khao Soi though. Still able to satisfy my craving for Khao Soi. \n- My partner ended using some of the Khao soi curry for his pineapple rice, because it's just so bland. \nOverall: probably the only dish we'd reorder. \n\nPineapple chicken curry: \n- I tried a bit and it wasn't bad. Very nice coconut flavour. \n\nI think safest is to order anything curry. Avoid fried rice. Avoid their soup.", 2], ["Decent spot. Ample parking in a gas station plaza.

Packed with shrimp deep fried with crispy batter, it is made into a donut shape served with sweet sauce on the side. Kids really love this that we have to order again. \n\nThe next few dishes that came are all very good too. Khao Soi with beef, tasty and just the right spiciness and consistency of the curry sauce.

The rest of the review remains as-is. ** \n\nShrimp Doughnut - Was a generous portion for this shareable app.  Heck, if you love shrimp but are a light eater, this may even do as your main. The sweet chilli sauce it came with however, lacked flavor.  Needs a bit more kick, in my opinion.  4/5.\n\nKhao Soi - This one I was excited for as the only other place I go for this dish is Downtown.  Had the chicken version and it was actually quite delicious.  Not as good as the one I've had Downtown but good enough that I'd order it again. 4/5.\n\nGreen Curry - My friend ordered this with chicken and it was delicious.  Was a very hearty and generous serving. Also had just the right amount of heat.  Something I'd definitely order again. 5/5. \n\nDeep Fried Ice Cream - Presentation-wise, it was beautiful and even looked high-end. It was however, quite heavy.  Definitely a shareable serving, but it could use more flavoring. Perhaps more chocolate sauce or something. If you're looking at the price, it was worth it for the size.  But not so much the taste. 3/5.\n\nGrilled Bread with Custard - The grilled bread, especially the charred parts were good.  The drizzled custard was delicious.  Definitely the star of the plate.  My friend asked for extra as the amount of drizzle wasn't enough, ratio-wise. 3/5.", 4], ["When you first walk in during a weekend dinner rush...this place might look congested with customers at the front counter...but don't worry because there is a whole NEW dimension at the back of the store. ^^\n\nWe came in a party of 2 and the waiter offered us a spot either the FRONT or the BACK of the store. We chose the BACK! It was definitely a GOOD choice :)\n\nThe front vs. back of the store was like night and day. The d\u00e9cor of the backroom was unique and fun. I loved the cone shaped lights- it really brightened up the room! The murals and drawings were a nice additive to enhance the overall feel. In contrast, the front gave a more modern/stern vibe with black wooden furniture and chairs.  \n\nVegetarian Pad Thai (no spice)- Way TOO SWEET. I don't remember ordering  my Pad Thai as a dessert? O.o\n\nIt was partially my fault because I forgot to inform the server I wanted mild spice level (she never asked for my spice level preference). Nevertheless, the noodles were cooked perfectly and there were plenty of vegetables. The dish was OKAY, I think a little spice would've helped this dish tremendously.  \n\nSatay chicken- Love the choice of sauces which were fish and peanut sauce. I prefer the peanut sauce- love the combination of sweet and hint of spice. The chicken was very tender. The only thing was... I wished I ordered more!! \n\nService was decent until we wanted our bill. We asked for the bill not ONCE but..... TWICE!! Do they NOT want us to pay for the meal? Free meal ? Fine with me :) I guess third time is the charm! They finally gave us the bill after the 3rd attempt and no apologizes were made whatsoever.

I'm ordering my dishes at least MILD spice level.", 3], ["Located in the same plaza as the gas station. If you walk further in the restaurant theres better seating and lighting at the back.

At first I thought it would be like any eggy-breakfasty type thing but this just tasted different - the beef flavoured the eggs in an absolutely amazing way, and the zucchini-corn side fritters provided a fresh contrast to the spice.\n- Huevos Y Chorizo: The chorizo patties looked flat and limp, but were absolutely heavenly to taste - smoky, slightly spicey, perfectly greasy. The side scrambled eggs were so smooth and milky, and the side corn salsa added a nice kick.\n\nWhen you dine at Rikkochez, it's almost like they've travelled to different places and taken back all they've learned about cooking/cuisines to serve you a world of flavour on your plate.

I had the Sheftalia/Falafel combo so I could sample both dishes. It was a perfect balance. Love that the owners (a husband/wife duo) one front of house and the other behind the grill, are there and are passionate about what they do.

They definitely know how to adapt the dishes on demand. Two of us had lamb, which we were told gets roasted for six hours, and the taste of which was a real treat.

After almost taking the safe option and popping in to the Detroit Eatery, we continued on to Rikkochez to discover all but one of the tables open.\n\nI forget what we ate on the previous visit, but it cannot have been what we ordered this time, as these were dishes we will not forget. I had the Turkish eggs, and my girlfriend the shakshuka. The Turkish eggs were to-die-for delicious, savoury chili oil, gooey egg yolks and just enough crunchy salt in every bite, drizzled at the table with generous dollops of their own house-made habanero hot sauce, all propped up on a fresh and delicious pita. The shakshuka was equally on point, fragrant with cumin and stewy tomatoes - less like spaghetti sauce than some places do. And complete with meatballs, another welcome addition I have not seen elsewhere. Even the coffee stood out as bold - I took the for me rare step of adding cream to smooth it out a bit and enjoyed every drop.\n\nThe spicily-sauced dishes were a bit too piquant to share with our little Bubba, but he was well-served by samples of toast and some of the poached egg and meatballs cleansed of their sauce accompaniments.\n\nFinally, the staff were warm, friendly and attentive. And the hall, which had been near empty upon our arrival, was deservedly as full as our original destination had been by the time we packed the little monkey, and Sophie la giraffe, up to brave the short stroll back to the car. Five full stars. Look forward to exploring the supper menu. I regretted not taking a picture of the Turkish eggs before devouring them, as I could not find one on Yelp.

The pad Thai with soft shell crab is my favourite - it has a great sauce, perfectly crunchy bean sprouts and tart mango on the side.", 5], ["My personal recommendation would be the pork cheek slices, green curry, and the minced pork over rice with an egg.\nThe pork cheeks slices were super tender and juicy, such a great dish to start a meal!\nThe green curry is quiet spicy even asked for mild, but the curry itself includes bamboo shoots, in which is such refreshing combination.\nThe minced pork over rice with an egg is super fragrant with Thai spices, that you won't be able to super once start eating!", 4], ["Great authentic Thai restaurant on par with Pai.  They offer a great menu selection with dishes such as their signature Softshell Crab Pad Thai and lots of Crispy Pork dishes, and you can specify hot spiciness level for each dish. The decor is very cool as well. They have a good selection of Thai drinks including Thai Iced Tea/Coffee. I found the Thai Iced Coffee to be on the weak side though - a bit too watered down. Otherwise great authentic Thai place that doesn't have the long wait like the other authentic Thai place in town.", 4], ["A great delicious place to satisfy your craving for Thai food. The lack of a line and attentive service makes it more appealing than Pai, especially when I'm just looking for a quick meal!\n\nTheir lunch specials range from $11-12. All lunch specials come with two vegetable spring rolls, which is a small but nice touch that helps balance out any dish. My personal favourite is the Green Curry with chicken, served with a bed of rice. I love the bamboo shoots in the curry, which adds a different element to the dish. The curry itself is quite rich and spicy. It's a flavour explosion, but the flavours are tied together quite well without it being too overwhelming. For $11, the portion size is generous and leaves me feeling full every time!\n\nThe decor is vibrant and colourful. I personally LOVED the detailed pattern on the cups and the cool murals on the walls; it really shows how much thought was put into creating an authentic and pleasant Thai dining experience.\n\nThe service is also excellent.

It replaced a previously abysmal Thai restaurant, so I was hesitant to go there in the first place. However, friends dragged me over there and I had a fabulous meal (red curry). I was very pleasantly surprised and the service was really good. The decor is charming, so everything worked out great. Only hesitation was the portion size, but I just prescribe that to non-typical North American serving sizes, and I'm fine. \n\nHowever, I went there a second time and had a pad thai and my friends had some of the curries. Somehow, the pad thai was very dry and flavourless, and the curry my friend had was totally different than expected and very flavourless as well. Now, we're no experts in what authentic Thai food is like, but if 19/20 restaurants do a curry in a specific way, I'd assume that's the proper way of making it. Anyway, be it as it may, service was still great, the food was OK but it definitely left me with a weird feeling of having had a better meal there before (not to mention other places). \n\nI'd definitely give it another shot - it's at least OK food, but I'd say they need to work on their consistency.

Everything was great and the drink was very fun and tasted good as well.

The pancakes have rich eggy, creamy flavor, which is definitely a plus. \n\n\nThe entire store smells like the sweet, rich fragrance of the eggy batter. I mean what else can I say than it's a must try.\n\nI got a free scoop of ice cream as a part of the yelp promotions for checking in, and they let you choose between matcha, vanilla, strawberry and chocolate. I chose strawberry, but the ice cream tasted very artificial, would not recommend. I should have tried matcha \n\nThe staff do speak English but not their forte... would communicate in Japanese next time.\n\nWould definitely come back to try out other flavors\n\nJust as a side note, I love how their forks are golden. It adds to the maerchen-ness and so pretty, like I'm in a fairytale!", 5], ["If you're a fan of souffl\u00e9 and pancakes, look no further and check out @fuwafuwapancakes for their sweet, airy, and smooth pancakes. \n\nIf you've ever had uncle testsu Japanese cheesecake, and your a fan of that, then you'll definitely love this. We can't compare this pancake is to Japan standards but it's delicious. The pancake itself is very light, fluffy, smooth, and buttery. You could pretty much chew this pancake without teeth. They have a variety of flavours to top your pancake that range from fruit filled to sugary savoury. We chose a fruity topping with a nice cool light semi sweat cream with a side of carmalized bananas.

Emotionless female workers in the back.  Would never go back again. I'm never one to write a bad review but clearly customer service wasn't their forte.  To make things worse, it took 45 mins to make two pancakes!! The pancakes could taste like gold but the service left a sour note in my taste buds. They wanted us out because we didn't order enough food to meet their requirements of taking up a seat in their store. It wasn't even busy when we walked in.  Maybe they should post a friendly note at the front of their door to let people know that if you don't buy enough pancakes for each person then you will be asked to leave instead of giving people the dirty look. Or maybe even politely let people know as they are paying that we don't have enough seating here and to guide us to look at their oh-so-tiny fine print before unleashing their dirty looks from the band of disgruntled workers. You are paying for the pancakes but you are also paying to expect some level of service that is at least, deemed respectable not despicable.

The service was not as great because we waited for 30 minutes bur no one came up to us to let us know  it'll take a little longer.

The box was pretty full, however there was not much chicken at all. It was mainly filled with veggies. Thus, I thought it was a bit expensive (around $16) for what it's worth. I can get something similar at chipotle or the halal guys for much cheaper and with more meat. The chicken was also cold and flavourless; all of its flavour came from the salad.

This place is located in Kensington Market in Toronto. They have posted hours and are typically open for lunch and dinner. I arrived as soon as they opened and a line had already formed. They have more than just d\u00f6ners to choose from. However, since I'd been on the lookout I had to get one. They have options for different sauces and ask if you would like one, two, or, all three.

It was bigger than the size of my face!  It was loaded with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, red cabbage, onions, hot sauce, garlic aioli, yogurt herb, and fresh leaf lettuce.  The pita bread was sooo good!  Despite it having so many ingredients in it, it held up very well and was easy to eat with your hands.

They also have lamb/veal sandwiches, halloumi for vegetarians and currywurst with a delicious tomato-based curry sauce. \n\nAll sandwiches can be dressed up with fries and feta cheese for an upcharge, but I honestly find them just fine as-is. \n\nOne of the big plus points for me is that they use Ritual and Uber Eats for online ordering, so there's no real reason to wait in line. \n\nDuring the summer they have an outdoor patio which is great, and their beer selection is extensive and very reasonably priced. \n\nAt around $11 plus tax for a sandwich and $11-14 for a teller box it's not exactly cheap, but I've never left hungry.

The combination of the sauces mixed well with the seasoning, giving it a savoury and spicy flavour similar to that of shawarma (I understand that D\u00f6ner has some Turkish roots, if I'm not mistaken!). \n\nIt was a bit pricey for the portion (~$15 excluding tips), but all my friends that had chicken or lamb teller seemed really satisfied, so I think I'll return and give that a try.

It's a German styled street food restaurant specializing is sandwiches and beer. \n\nThe Doner is like a Greek Gyro, it contains think, juicy slices of spit-roasted, chicken, veal or lamb. You can order them on a pita or in a box. The meat is tossed with fresh tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce and red cabbage, then doused with a spicy, garlicky yogurt sauce. If you like spicy foods, ask for the hot sauce. It's a slow burning, I believe cumin based. \n\nThey also have a halloumi Doner, which is a fried salty cheese w/ feta in a pita or box, and their currywurst and fries. \n\nOn tap or bottles, you can find nine German brews, including a Schwarzbier. \n\nIt's a great cheap eat in Kensington!", 4], ["The food is great.

Instead, they linger around, look at you and continue doing what they were doing as if they can't take five minutes to say \"How may I help you?\" \"What would you like to order?\".

The saganaki was fried well, the octopus had great texture/taste, the moussaka was full and hearty, etc. It's just that I was expecting something more. Or maybe more precisely, something different. For while Athens Restaurant is better than many of the Greek restaurants I've tried in Toronto, it's not a lot better, let alone truly different/outstanding. \n\nSo 3.5 stars is a reflection of my confusion with this charming place/experience that raised my expectations, and the food that was good but not magical.", 3], ["I last went to Greece exactly 5 years ago and I really wanted to re-live my Greek experience by trying out a Greek place that I have never tried out before. I was recommended to try out this restaurant by my friends and I decided to go along with it.\n\nThe first thing I recall is that the decor reminded me so much of the typical Greek restaurant decor and I was already smitten. After being shown to my seat, I was lead to the kitchen to see the specials.\n\nI decided to order a Gyro plate (regular menu item) as well as the spinach pie (called spanakopita, and was a special for that day). \n\nI was foolish because I ordered too much for myself, but the food has been extremely delicious and transported my palette back to Greece. I paid a total of $29 (including a 20% tip) and I realized that the food portions were definitely generous for that price.\n\nI would visit again and I would really want to bring my friends. Never have I been invited to check out a restaurant's kitchen and check out the specials, and that is probably the most outstanding experience about the restaurant that I will remember for a long time.", 5], ["Given the fact that I just came back from Greece a month ago, I ALMOST felt like I was whisked right back.  It's those damn Greek chairs! lol  When you walk in, you are welcomed with dim lighting and Greek music.  Also, the menu is exactly how it would be in Greece.  \n\nI was beyond hungry coming here, hungry to the point where you feel sick.  So that kinda threw me off and I couldn't truly enjoy my experience. Still, I forced myself to eat. As you may have read in the reviews (and it says right on their menu), they take you to the kitchen to show you the specials of the day.  One of the specials was Fasolakia, which are green beans cooked in tomato sauce, so I had to get a side order of it.  I love it!  I also ended up just getting a single pork skewer and my boyfriend got the chicken souvlaki dinner.\n\nThey serve complimentary bread which was really good according to my boyfriend.  The thing that surprised me the most was that they actually give you a personal horiatiki as your salad that's included in your meal.  No other Greek restaurants, that I have been to in the GTA, do this. It was a good serving.  Enough for two people.  Taste and presentation were on point. Although, tomatoes here can't compare to how they are in Greece. All the food came out fairly quick.  We were in and out in under an hour.  The pork and chicken souvlaki were delicious and very juicy.  Tzatziki was on point as well.  Potatoes included in the dinner were soft and flavourful.  The only complaint from the both of us was the rice.  Nothing special at all, in fact pretty bland.  \n\nDespite feeling so sick on my visit here, I still think the place deserves 4 stars.  I would return here if I was really feigning for Greek food.  Tastes are as authentic as their Greek chairs.  It doesn't get realer than that.", 4], ["This is the BEST Greek restaurant in town. The food is very authentic very delicious and very fresh!", 5], ["Food: (5 stars)\nThey got a few specials every day which has limited quantity.  To see the specials you actually walk into the kitchen to talk directly to the chef.  Every time I got the special I was extremely satisfied. The cost of the specials is around $20.  \nThe items from the menu are all really good: Calamari (both grilled and fried), octopus, dips, greek salad (With huge pieces of feta cheese), Saganaki cheese (grilled cheese with a shot and lemon poured over it). \nThe only thing I was not a huge fan of was fried Zucchini.  \n\nThe classic dinners are very large: salad, potato, rice and meet.  Ordering appetizers and a full dinner will be too much.  I would suggest getting an appetizer, 2 skewers and a full dinner for 2 people to share.\n\nService: (5 stars)\nVery friendly, and attentive.\n\nAtmosphere: (4 stars)\nA smaller/cozy restaurant.

I go to this restaurant so that I can walk into the back room and ask the chef what they have left. If I am lucky they will have some stews left that will most likely contain veal or beef and then I will also order an entire fish which they grill with lemon, filet and season with olive oil. Athens is one of those restaurants that you can go to any time and it won't break your bank, you can have a drink with the owner (I suggest retsina) who is my fathers good friend and eat a nice meal. This has become one of my if not my favorite Greek restaurant in Toronto due to the relaxed atmosphere and the unconventional menu that shines like a diamond in the rough compared to other Greek restaurants in Toronto.

Everything looked good (calamari rice, stuffed pepper, veal stew, chicken cutlets, lamb chops). We failed to make a reservation, so did take out and decided to hang out at the bar, which is great for ppl watching. I think George knows all the patrons, everyone was exchanging kisses and greetings in Greek. Definitely had the feel of being in a neighbourhood bar in Europe. Noticing we were waiting for our food, George offered us complimentary drinks and takes the time to chat us up. Finally, we get our food so we head out. Despite being crazy busy, George catches up to us outside and thanks us for coming by!\n\nSure this place is small, the waiters are not articulate, and service can be slow.

Sadly I did learn not to mix poutine and hard cider as that was not a great combination for my stomach hahaha. Overall the poutine did have a nice flavor and I did like the hard side of that they serve me.

This is due primarily to the fact that a social Group I helped run has had Events here since the Group first started about 10  1/2 years ago and the venue is pretty close to where I live.  I consider C'est What to be my favourite bar in Toronto.  Why, you might ask?\n\nRead on to find out:\n\nThe venue used to be a wine cellar housed in a 100+ year old building; since C'est What first opened back in the late 1980's, there have been a multitude of different Events here.  My 1st visit here in 2007 was also the first time I attended a Beer Fest., which they host twice a year.  Called the Spring (or Fall) Festival of Craft Breweries, there's no admission fee, sampling stations set up at both bars in the venue and you pay $1 for a 3 to 5 ounce sample of beer (a small no. of beers at the Fest. cost 2 or 3 tickets - you buy tickets for all samples at the front entrance of the bar).  There's always about 48 (!) beers to choose from including cask selections, seasonal beers and one-offs, etc.  They also have other Events such as tap takeovers; live entertainment on certain nights and even their own radio station.\n\nWith over 40 taps specializing in Ontario Craft Beer, C'est What is a beer lover's paradise.  They also have a wide variety of often unique/eclectic food choices.  On the left/east side they have pool tables and dart boards and quite a bit of seating on both sides of the bar which is quite a large venue overall.  They even have a large fish bowl and a nice fireplace just inside the left entrance, where several friends and I sat and enjoyed beers and food at my last visit there just yesterday.\n\nI've found the service to be fairly good there over the years; they allow you to sample the beers if you're not sure what you want to order and/or want to sample something new or something you haven't had before.  Yesterday a friend and I split their Tostidos which were quite flavourful; on previous visits I've had or shared their veggie burger, calamari, nachos or fries.  A long time ago I had brunch there on several occasions with another social Group.\n\nWith low ceilings, somewhat upscale and unique d\u00e9cor and an obviously distinct layout, the ambiance of C'est What is like no other venue I've been to.  It can get crowded on certain nights with correspondingly slow(er) service at times.  The prices for food and beverages are somewhat high but you have to take into account the fact that the venue is located in the downtown core.  Conveniently located close to several subway stations, not to mention St. Lawrence Market and the Financial District, C'est What is a great destination for regulars, tourists and occasional visitors alike.", 5], ["Last night started and ended here, which if I remember is a good thing!

We only realized when we sat down, so we told our waitress that we were actually there for the live music, and she told us to just directly head on over to that area. We did as told, found ourselves a table... only for the host to come to us 10 minutes later saying in a not very friendly tone something along the lines of \"You can't just move here yourselves... you need to let the host know.\" That's literally all she came to our table for... to tell us that we did something wrong... like a teacher telling her students that they did something wrong. First of all, we would have told the host if the waitress told us to, but we were just told we can move their directly so we did. But even so, isn't it the waitress' job to let you know? Second of all, it was rude for her to come over just to make a point that we did something wrong... correct me if I'm wrong, but that's definitely not how you treat your customers. \n\nI'm still giving two stars because I had decent previous experiences and the live music that night was great.", 2], ["Interesting place near down town close to Union station.

It seemed like many patrons had also come here for a beer after a long day! Seemed like the right thing to do. I don't see McAuslan's Apricot Wheat on many menus, so that sealed the deal. My friend is a hoppier beer drinker and tried the Big Butt Smoked Dark Ale and the Chocolate Ale. I tasted both. The smoked ale tasted like beer and bacon.... it was interesting! I'm a chocolate gal, but I don't feel the chocolate flavour came through as strong as it should have. Many other beers on the menu I'd like to try! \n\nAs for food, we shared a Buffalo Burger and a Lamburger. I mostly just wanted to say 'Lamburger' out loud. So worth it. The Bison burger was tasty! Bison a very lean meat, so there was ample tomato-onion chutney. It was juicy, but dense. The herbed fries were so good, that they're in my top 5! My Lamburger was on fresh naan with fresh veggies and oodles of tzatziki(as there should be!). It came with housemade chips. They were OK, but the herbed fries were too good not to steal. I'm a fan of lamb and this was doing it for me. I'd get this again. At least now I know it's as enjoyable to eat as it to say out loud. :D \n\nThe service was great. The hosts were welcoming and our server was super cool. A chill atmosphere with chill staff. There was live music going on as well, but it was in a different room, so it wasn't super loud.

They have board games and playing cards available and I saw groups utilizing these while waiting for their food, so that was interesting :)\n\nTips-\n1. Bring your official ID /since they card everyone at the door regardless of whether you'll be drinking or not.\n2. Hence, kids and families this place is not for you in the later evenings\n3. Don't order their salads = sad and small, so you're better off ordering their apps or mains\n4. Noise level is quite loud, had to shout at my partner at times for him to hear me", 3], ["I know a lot of people come for the beer, but we came for lunch and were not disappointed. The portions were massive and delicious. The pulled pork quesadilla came with a huge side of tortilla chips and guacamole, and the bison burger came with a side of herb fries. \n\nEverything was tasty, fresh, hot and came to our table quickly. There only seemed to be one guy serving the whole restaurant during lunch but you could tell he has been working there for awhile! He gave us awesome customer service, and made the whole experience that much more enjoyable!", 5], ["Over the years I've gone to C'est What for lunch and dinner, during the week, after work, on the weekend, at a variety of times. While the service is on the slow side, it seems to stem less from inattentivenes and more from a relaxed casual dining atmosphere.\n\nIt's a great little place for a beer and burger after work, or a date, or just a bite. I'm a big fan of the lamb burger and the bison burger, with the delicious sweet potato fries or even the regular fries which usually come nicely herbed. But the BEST part of C'est What is washing down allo that food with a beer from the Great Lakes Brewery.\n\nTheir Christmas selection of beer is probably my favourite, with the Festive (?) one, spiced with nutmeg, being my absolute favourite. They do have an orange-y light lager that is pretty refreshing as well.\n\nAnd to those people complaining about the noodle dishes, it's the equivalent of going to a Chinese restaurant and getting a burger, srriously.", 4], ["Three point five. It's a good pub atmosphere, and clean too. All sorts of music playing, I heard a good amount of industrial. They've got a wide selection of beers, although being underage the most I got was a couple sips of my dad's Steam Whistle (which was pretty good). Service was friendly but a bit slow, and they forgot to bring my dad his beer.\n\nI got the buffalo burger. It was seasoned well but I should have ordered it slightly more rare. Buffalo meat is far leaner than cow meat (tastes the same though) so you lose those nice greasy juices. The barbecue sauce that came with it was too liquid, as in it could have been thicker. The fries were great! I had mine as poutine, which for the uninitiated are fries with gravy and cheese curds. They're delicious, although slightly bad for the arteries. But to quote something from the menu, \"A diet is a way to starve yourself so you live a few more years.\" The regular fries were also tasty.\n\nOverall I enjoyed C'est What? and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good pub experience with some good food. Be warned, it gets expensive: ran about $85 for four people.", 3], ["I was taken to lunch as a treat to C'est What (pronounced 'Say' What?, for American readers).  Who can grumble about free lunch?  Certainly not I.  With that being stated, would I come here on my own?  Probably not.\n\nThe restaurant/bar is downstairs, which does in fact add to its ambiance.  However, the attraction stops there.  I mean, the decor is certainly passable as indicated by the smattering of people and families about for lunchtime.  However, there is no distinctive flavoring or flair.  A pool table rests in the backroom.  A fireplace with a circle of couches resides near the entrance.  A bar, much like a legion hall bar, occupies the right of the main room.  With a play-on-words restaurant name, I expected more in terms of clever, class, or at least kitsch.\n\nThe bartender was doubling as our server.  This lasted for the first round of drinks.  When my friend asked for a water, a coffee, AND a beer, she was told to order the beer later.  Okay.... but then the bartender/server never returned until after our food was almost completed.  The back server ended up taking our orders.\n\nI ordered the vegetable roti.  It was okay.  The roti shell was crumbly and farinaceous, leaving my palate a bit mealymouthed.  On the upside, my friend's shepherd's pie looked delicious -- especially the lush covering of cheese.\n\nAll in all, we ordered two dishes, a coffee, a hot tea, and one beer for a total of about $40 before tip.

This walk marked the last time I wore Converse All-Stars as legitimate footwear and switched to New Balance (I couldn't walk for days after).\n\nIt is now the place where the internet and real-life famously(?) and delightfully collided. I also had loads of delicious St. Ambroise Apricot beer (which I've never had on tap before), and ate far more poutine than I ever thought I would (I guess I can't really keep claiming not to like it, huh?), possibly due to the generous garnish of green onions.\n\nThe atmosphere is really nice, cozy and yes, \"mature\". Enjoy many beers, upscale pub fare and a really (as Connie said) great place to sit and gather with many others.

The bison burger is amazing; there is so much flavour in the patty itself, it isn't just a vessel for toppings. Because of bison's leanness you should ask for it a little rarer. Another great choice that seems to be often overlooked is the shepherd's pie. The pulled pork sandwich should be avoided due to a very strange celery heavy sauce choice.\n\nPricing for food and beer is quite reasonable considering the quality. Mixed drinks, on the other hand, are shockingly expensive and made with middle of the road spirits. If you want something other than beer you should probably head elsewhere.", 4], ["Cool vibe, decent service, good food, great list of Canadian microbrews.", 4], ["C'est What? has a great selection of local craft beers and holds many fine beer-related events.

They seem to actively dislike groups and go out of their way to inconvenience them. For instance, one night we were told at 10pm that our section of the bar was closing and that our whole group of 10 would have to move to the other side after settling our bill. Odd.\n\nOccasionally, the service in general can be surly or indifferent as well.\n\nThat being said, I'll keep coming back for the cozy atmosphere, the great beer (selection and quality) and the Dijon chicken fingers and skinny fries!", 4], ["Hidden gem literally.\nHidden in a basement on the busy Front street is this casual atmosphere place with a very interesting menu.\nAfter eating for days at places with same old boring menus we found the menu here to be a welcome relief.

My mom ordered the Roti and was surprised again the actual roti was good it was massively filled with veggies though and was ok flavor wise. My bf had the bison burger and the coffee porter bbq sauce was a bit on the runny side but was really good and he added jalepenos on top of that (not such a good idea it became too spicy but still really good) Beer selection was not as much as i thought it would be but the beers we had from the rotating cask menu were good.", 3], ["A favourite for food and drink \nThe Bison Burger, The Apple Pie a la mode, and good daily specials. \nThey brew their own beers as well as have a good selection of Ontario microbrewery beers.", 4], ["Agree with Sarah B., what happened to the relaxed, beer a-plenty afternoon killer? Doesn't matter how many people you show up with, you now get a list of rules and inconveniences before they deign to seat you.  Don't be two minutes ahead of your party - if you don't have quorum, you don't get a table.  \n\nThe beer selection is great of course, and the only reason to visit.

Their selection of beers is quite decent and so is their food menu. Although this place is not in my Toronto's Best list, I would still recommend it and especially if you go for a bit to eat. My suggestion will be the Lamb Burger, a must have.  Only advice is to stay away from the Sweet Potato fries as these tend to be on the greasy side. Other than that, the regular fries and onion rings are great.", 3], ["Shame on me for continuing to go to this place even though the experience is terrible every time. Aside from a decent menu (if they ever actually let you sit at a table) all they really have going for them is their \"great selection\" of Ontario Craft Beer. We have long since realized that we can get the same (or better) beer for a better price in at least three other bars in Toronto (Hint: The Only Cafe, Victory Cafe, The Rhino, or even Bar Volo).\nWe have had continuously rude service at this place. The hipsters they staff are not knowledgeable about the beer, yet somehow feel they can be smug to their patrons (who in our case are actually brewers at OCBs). They also seem to be hung up on having the perfect number of people at each table, which makes it almost impossible to get a table in a timely manner. Even though they have plenty of seating throughout the establishment, they won't seat people at any table where there might be an extra chair. Once on a very slow night our party of six was asked to move to a different table because our table had seven chairs.\nThe final straw was the last time we went there, when we waited nearly two hours for a table because we had nine people. We came into the bar around nine thirty and even though we offered to break up into smaller groups, they didn't seat us until after eleven thirty. When we were finally seated, it was in a room that had several other empty tables. We had been waiting so long to eat dinner--I personally hadn't eaten in seven hours--that we scarfed down our food with water (because we couldn't drink anymore on empty stomachs) and then went home to bed. On top of everything, our food was dry and overcooked in what seemed like a poor attempt to make up for our wait by getting our food to us quickly.\nAfter three years and many horrible nights, I vow that I will NEVER go back to C'est What.

It can get spicy over time but cool off with a pineapple ginger juice!", 4], ["The food here is exceptional. I am not vegetarian or vegan but I get regular cravings for the food at veggie D'lite. I love the variety you  get in one dish. I always get the plate.\nDelicious!!!!!", 5], ["At first we had come to Kensington for another restaurant and while walking past Veggie D'Light we caught this amazing scent coming from their doors. Had an amazing meal, Jerk Seitan with chickpeas, jack fruit, moringa bread. The staff were extremely friendly and provided a lot of information about the food. Now I know what it's like to be in a state of nirvana. Great for vegetarians. Highly recommend", 5], ["AMAZING! Thank you so much for what you are doing Peter! For someone who loves Caribbean food but who has also recently become a practicing vegan it's been a struggle to deny the Jerk Chicken cravings. No longer have to! We will be back.....often!", 5], ["Before this weekend, my impressions of the Toronto vegan restaurant scenery were pretty negative. I thought that most of the vegan places were average overpriced restaurants serving food that I could essentially cook myself. And then Veggie D'Light happened.\n\nUntil further notice, this is my new favorite restaurant.\n\nIt's DELICIOUS, the price is CHEAP, and there is AMAZING SERVICE. Winning combo.\n\nLet's start with the food. So freaking good. I got the small meal combo and the lentil soup. The meal combo came with the jerk seitan (which is the perfect combination of spices) and the curry chickpeas (I could write a love poem about this). And the lentil soup was a delicious creamy explosion of flavors. Everything is completely vegan!!!! As someone who recently found out they are lactose intolerant, this was amazing to hear, because I love creamy soups.\n\nThe price is super reasonable too! Probably one of the least expensive vegan places in Toronto.\n\nAnd the service!!! Since it was our first time, we were given samples of the food, which is honestly such a great concept. Like, I wish every other restaurant did that. I like to know what I'm signing up for before ordering my food.\n\nAnyway, Veggie D'Light has a great homy vibe. I will 100% be going back for more.", 5], ["Best food in Toronto, not just vegan but food period. I've been here three or four times and I just love the flavours and how I feel after eating the food - comforted, full and happy. The jerk seitan, salad and roti are my favorite but the magic is in how everything mixes in the plate and I am hooked. Thank you so much!", 5], ["Seriously amazing vegan spot, best ital food in town, super good vibes, amazing portions, incredibly tasty, wonderful owner, super chill spot, you GOTTA check this place out!!!!!", 5], ["Well, the owner is the chef and runs the place by himself, the food prepared is fresh just like homemade, light vegan food. He is kind and cheerful. Its a single hand running eatery. But I find the food just okay. I tried different stuff couple of times, but could not agree with the 5-star reviews. If you are in Kensington, looking for vegan food, this should not be your first choice.", 3], ["If you want some seriously incredible Caribbean flavors-check this spot out. Vegan - Vegetarian dishes what more can you ask for. I can eat everything on the menu", 4], ["I was never expecting a pizza to be done (well done) in like 5-7 minutes. Or probably I didn't know it takes only little time to cook.\n\nThe line was long but then it was moving and I could see the service is fast and they all are their toes working quickly getting the pizzas ready for the customers.\n\nThe Margherita pizza was so yummy! That I had finished myself.. despite of me not being a fan of pizza - this place has changed that for me.", 5], ["I really like Pi Co! Seems to be following a trend of pizza places that allow you to build your own, and that are Neapolitan (cooked very quickly at a high heat in a special oven). You can get a margherita for 10$ or a build your own for $14. Lots of topping combinations which means there is something for everyone.\n\nI also really like the garlic bread that you can get as a side...it's big enough for a meal, and if you get a dipping sauce on the side, it's a great alternative to a whole pizza.\n\nThe only thing I don't love about Pi Co (and this is why I gave it three stars) is that they have one or two pizza cutters to slice up your pizza and they seem to use the same ones for everyone's pizza which is a huge allergy concern, and can transfer the taste from the previously cut pizza.", 3], ["I ordered a Pizza Margherita, it was pretty lackluster. It was a pretty simple pizza so I've written the review accordingly. I've had other Pi Co pizzas before (albeit at another location) and they were much better.\n\nThe pizza was a little bit more burnt than I would've liked at the bottom (but this is expected for any stone oven pizza).\n\nThe pizza lacked any distinctive flavour or kick. There was an adequate amount of sauce, and pieces of mozzarella all along the surface of the pizza, but even then the dough and crust somehow overwhelmed the former two ingredients in flavour. Whenever I bit into the pizza with some mozzarella, the whole circle of mozzarella would detach from the pizza, which was also somewhat problematic (I also got the pizza kind of cold, which is maybe that is why)", 3], ["Finally got to try Pi Co. I love how I can choose among a selection of fresh ingredients, and know I can add as much/little as I want for the flat rate. However, I would advise splitting the pizza with someone as the pizza can get cold by the time you get to the 3rd and final slice.", 4], ["I've seen Pi Co around the city and I've been dying to try it. I'll start off by saying that the staff aren't friendly at all. When I came in no one even paid attention to me, not even a hello. It wasn't until I went to the front counter to place my order where I actually talked to a staff member and she was not friendly nor did she even make eye contact with me. Definitely taking off a star for that. \n\nAnyway, I decided to go with what I know best so I got a margherita pizza. I like how the counter table is full of fresh looking toppings to choose from and how every topping has labels at the bottom so your know the different types of cheeses and veggies you're choosing from. From when I placed my order, the pizza was made in like a minute and was in the oven for about 5 minutes. In total, I was in and out within less than 10 minutes which is pretty good for a made-to-order pizza. \n\nThe pizza itself was decent, not the best I've ever had but was pretty good. I'd try it again but maybe at another location. You should also train your staff on basic customer service skills.", 3], ["Love this pizza joint.\n\nI order the \"craft yours\" which allows any toppings for $14. \n\nMy fave toppings are:\n.. California tomato sauce \n.. Mozzarella on the east half\n.. Fior di latte on the west half\n.. tomatoes and hot banana peppers on the whole thing\n.. Pepperoni on the north half \n.. Spicy soppressata on the south half \n\nThat way, every slice is different and every slice is \n\nI debated between 4 and 5 stars and ultimately landed on 4 because the value for money is a bit on the high side for me. \n\nWould recommend to those that like to treat themselves every now and then.", 4], ["Pi Co is a great place to go for a slice in the Yorkville area. \n\nDefinitely lives up to the yorkville vibe as this place makes yummy make your own's for a pretty price point.\n\nBut it's worth it...the quality of the dough and the toppings does not get left behind. The base make your own allows you 3 topping choices. I went with a sausage, pepperoni and roasted garlic. The crust was fluffy and airy, which helps not to feel bloated after having a whole pizza. \n\nI ordered through Ritual and they had the pizza ready within 10 minutes. Great place if you need a quick bite over lunch. \n\nI would go back again, but maybe not often since the pizza is 14$.", 4], ["Make no mistake, Pi Co pizzas taste very good, and are above average in comparison to other pizza joints. The problem is that Pi Co will always be compared to Blaze Pizza, and Blaze is a more enjoyable pizza.\n\nWhere Pi Co definitely excels over Blaze is in the thickness of it's dough. If you're  the kind of person who prefers a bit more body to the crust, then Pi Co will be your pizza haven of choice. Value wise, $14 for unlimited toppings sounds good, but compared to Blaze, the toppings are much more stingy, and Blaze is cheaper. \n\nOverall, a good pizza, but is inferior to Blaze, which is what stops it from being a superstar joint. That being said, they do have San Marzano tomatoes.", 4], ["It's decent pizza. The only thing I'm not too sure about is that the center of the pizza is slightly soggy with oil. But I'm not a pizza expert, and I think that toaster oven baked Pillsbury mini pizzas taste good, so I'm not too sure I'm in any position to know if this is how it's supposed to be.\n\nIt tastes good, plain and simple. Only gripe is the lack of seating in here, but it's understandable because Bay St rent is probably absurd.\n\nI recommend sticking with something simple like the margherita. Less is more with this place.", 4], ["2 stars for 2 reason,1.they gave my order to somebody else,why I know? Because the guy made my pizza and that day it was crazy busy and the lady gave it to somebody else, 2. No consistency..I've ordered that pizza before at bay/bloor location,the 1st time there's a lot of toppings but the 2nd time I came for same pizza less toppings! Doesn't matter if the place is really busy,quality should be the same.", 2], ["Great value for a solid pie - you can't go wrong with $14 for a pizza with unlimited toppings! You can load up on the cheeses, veggies and protein and have it all cooked in a pizza oven.  Make sure to add the roasted garlic, but probably not if you have a meeting right after. \n\nGreat for a quick bite or takeout since there's not a lot of seating here. Their sweet pi was a little bit doughy for my liking, but still worth it for the price.", 4], ["I tried Margherita.  I liked it because it wasn't too salty, but the dough was kind of hard to chew.", 3], ["Pi Co offers a nice lunch option if I am nearby. The location is great and I enjoy creating my own custom pizza here. \n\nService: \nThe service is quick and friendly. They are busy during peak lunch hours but it is worth waiting for a fresh pizza!\n\nFood:\nThere is nothing special about their pizzas. The price may be steep for a pizza that is quite small, but the prices are comparable to other nearby food joints.  \n\nOverall:\nPi Co makes a solid spot if you are looking for a single serving pizza to take-out.", 4], ["Whenever I am on my way to see a film at the Varsity theatre, you better believe I am making a stop off at Pi Co first. In terms of pizza places, it's not the best in the city. But it is pretty above average, cheap and the best part: you can make your own pizza with as many topics as you like. So um, yeah: it's always one of the go-to stops. \n\nFirst, you're greeted by the staff who will walk you through the entire process. You get to pick out your sauce (from a choice of three) and then if you chose the \"Craft Yours\", you're able to choose an unlimited amount of toppings and oh buddy, do they have toppings. My usual pizza usually includes chicken, bacon, spinach, and asparagus - just to name a few. The pizza is typically cooked in under 6 minutes and has thin crust and is never overdone. \n\nThe only thing that kind of sucks about here is there is never enough seating, so it's always a 50/50 chance that you'll actually be able to eat in the spot. \n\nEither way, I am a huge fan and I have turned many others onto Pi Co as well. Also huge bonus: they have gluten-free dough so all my celiac pals out there.", 4], ["Was here for dinner with a friend and was pretty impressed! I don't usually go to pizza places often and not many places impress me much but this one was different. Simple, easy, fast and tasted good if you want a quick summary of my experience.\n\nHonestly the only reason why we walked in was because my friend thought it was woodoven baked pizzas buuuuut that was not the case. Just a regular oven built big and looked similar to a woodoven one. Regardless, we still tried their pizzas out. It's a small shop so don't intend to go with a group bigger than 5 people otherwise you will probably invade half their tables and/or store, no joke!\n\nWe got the Marguerrita pizza and a \"Craft Your Own\" pizza and their pizza sizes were good for one person per pizza. Pretty filling depending on the toppings you had. Taste was great, soft and a bit charred at the crust but toppings and everything came together well. I actually went a bit crazy with the toppings and didn't think of it like a pizza at the time I was deciding what to put on it so I definitely dealt with the consequences later on. Nonetheless everything still tasted good!\n\nIf I ever crave and want some quick pizza, this is a place I'd return to if I was in the area.", 4], ["We went to the original location of Pi Co. which was at Bay and Bloor (right in the heart of Toronto).\n\nThe process at Pi Co. worked exactly like at Blaze Pizza: you pick the dough you wanted, then the pizza sauce, cheese, and unlimited toppings for a set price.  There were a good number of people dining in here when we arrived.  They have two tables and some stools for dine-in, but it seemed like a lot of people opted for take-away orders.\n\nWe shared a Craft Yours Pizza.  We chose a regular dough, with some Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes sauce, followed by four types of cheese -- blue cheese, goat cheese, fior di latte, and parmesan -- followed by a good helping of vegetables like basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and then bacon and ground sausage.  Then our pizza was thrown into the 1,000-degree oven for 90 seconds for a classic Neapolitan pizza style. \n\nIt was a very, very quick cooking process.  After paying for the pizza at the cashier and waiting just a few seconds, I saw the staff bring out our pizza from the oven, plop it into a pizza box (we asked for it to-go), and cut it up for us.  Ninety seconds was incredibly fast and thus there was practically zero wait time from start to finish.\n\nEven as I was watching the staff assemble our pizza together by throwing on the toppings that we selected, I felt that he wasn't as generous as the staff were at Blaze Pizza.  I also felt that the male staff threw all of the toppings into the centre part of the pizza and didn't scatter them out evenly.  This made for a potentially lop-sided pizza where not every bite had the substantial toppings to taste.  (Although I could have asked the male staff to add more ingredients in if I felt like there wasn't enough, the staff at Blaze Pizza in comparison put down a lot of generous toppings without asking.  The customized pizza at Blaze Pizza also costs less at $10.)\n\nI also noted that our pizza was quite burnt in two places on the top and also on the bottom.  I know that it must be hard to judge the pizza's cooking time especially since they have other orders in the 1,000-degree oven too but these were the things I noticed.\n\nIn terms of taste, I really liked the chewy thin crust of the pizza.  What I didn't like were the underwhelming number of ingredients and burnt parts.", 3], ["Their pizza just tastes like average pizza but worse because my crust was burnt. It just tasted carcinogenic to be perfectly honest.\n\nI also felt that they kind of skimped on the tomato sauce, but that could be because I like my sauce on the heavier side.\n\nThere are a lot of reviewers raving more about their custom pizzas rather than the margherita pizza, so perhaps that's what I should've gotten instead.\n\nNevertheless, I don't think I would come back for their margherita, but I would be willing to give their custom pizza a try.", 3], ["I shared a create-your-own pizza with my sister at this Pi Co location last night. The service was lightning-fast which, together with the smaller location, mean it's best set up for take-out. We decided to eat in as we weren't anywhere near home and had to reserve our seats with our bags while we ordered (yes, we were THOSE people) and were rushed out by other customers circling the table as soon as we'd taken the last bite.\n\nDespite the tight squeeze and rushed meal, the experience was great. The pizza's thin crust helps stave off the guilt so you can totally eat a whole pizza without feeling bad. There's a good selection of toppings.\n\nI think the process would be smoother if the pizzas went to a 'finishing' station before paying, where you can choose to put your arugula or balsamic vinegar etc. on after cooking.", 4], ["Great Location at Bay just North of Bloor.\n\nI love the concept of pick your own or you can go for their custom suggestions. Nothing beats a freshly baked pizza right out for the oven.\n\nMinimum seating so don't come with a big group. A group of 4 probably the max.\n\nAt $13 it might sound like a bit for a pizza, but this is the prime downtown location so I do expect to pay a premium.\n\nThe hardest though is to make all these decisions! Base, Sauce, Cheese and So many toppings to choose from.", 4], ["Rude. It was my first time going to pi co and the girl Was not patient at all when I was trying to order.

You get seated in booth-like tables, with wooden benches (there are no chairs, on benches) that have cute cushions on them. \n\nWe came on a Friday night and had to wait about 30 minutes standing in the restaurant. Unfortunately, they don't take names or phone numbers. However, the wait was worth it!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Yakitori Set A: a variety of 5 skewers for $18. My favorite was the sanmainiku (pork belly) and eringi (king oyster mushroom) skewers. The pork belly literally melted in your mouth and the mushroom tasted very meat-like! Those were definitely 10/10, and the other skewers were okay. \n- Momo mochi yakitori: also good, the texture of the rice cake was perfect paired with the chicken thigh!\n- Tori (chicken) karaage: good, perhaps a little over fried and dry\n- Buta no kakuni (braised pork belly with boiled egg): GET THIS! The pork belly melted in your mouth and the sauce added a really balance of sweetness to the meat.  \n- Okonomiyaki: this was delicious! They cut it into quarters for you. The Japanese mayo and ketchup on this dish is thiccc, but it's amazing. I love the bonito flakes too!\n\nOverall this is a great izakaya but it's a little pricier compared to some others. 5 little skewers for $18 is pretty pricey given that the skewers aren't exactly filling.

The small shop sure filled up quickly. My friend and I ordered a bunch of items to share:\n\nEbi Mayo\nThis dish was actually spectacularly done! The ebi (shrimp) had a very light but crisp batter, and was a decently large size. The tangy mayo dressing was a nice touch, and I really appreciate that they didn't overwhelm the shrimp with dressing. One of my favourites of the night!\n\nSet B\n\nRoasted tomatoes - these came in a skewer of 4, and were these small cherry tomatoes perfectly grilled. They were warm explosions of flavour, but nothing that requires great skill.\n\nMomo Negi - these chicken thigh skewers were very yum! I particularly enjoyed the negi (green onions), which were soft, juicy, and sweet.\n\nMochi Bacon - this also came in a set of 4, and smelled so sinfully delicious! The fatty, crispy bacon was a lovely companion to the soft doughy mochi.\n\nSagari - the 3 piece beef smelled heavenly! It was moist and flavourful, and quite tender!\n\nButarosu - this was my least favourite dish; I didn't really like the fatty pork bits that were oddly chewy. The flavour was okay though.\n\nSaba Shio\nThis grilled mackerel had the loveliest char marks I've ever seen! It was super fatty and fishy (my entire dish was filled with fish oil) but had a lovely texture and bite.\n\nGyu Don\nThe flavour of this bibimbap was good, with the sweet onions and mushrooms and teriyaki sauce. However, the meat was quite disappointing; it was the tough beef flank bits that you find in cheap stores and places. The crispy rice bits at the bottom of the popular piping bowl are always my favourite part! We waited almost 30 minutes for this bowl though... So painstakingly slow.\n\nOverall, it's a great spot to hang out with friends and relax. I was quite sad that they'd run out of the mochi yaki, which I was really interested in trying!", 4], ["For an izakaya the menu was very extensive. Most of the food was very good. Biggest table is about 8 people. I think anything you order will be decent. The price is reasonable for an izakaya. Just remember izakaya probably wont be filling unless you order alot. Watch out for street parking, it is my permit after 6. There are green p and other paid parking lots which arent expensive ($2.5\\hour).

Instead of going to the usual Guu/Kinka, we decided to try some place new and Kintaro definitely did not disappoint. \n\nFood 4/5\nTo start off I like that there is a large selection from sushi to yakitori to carbs like noodles and rice. We ordered beef sashimi, gyu tataki, aburi shime saba, fried soft shell crab, japango roll, grilled set a and b, grilled calamari and other various skewers. The highlight of my night was the beef sashimi and is arguably the best I've had. The portion was bigger compared to the competitors, is cut as thicker slices, wasn't icy from sitting on a bed of ice and the sauce tasted great. My other favourites was the gizzard, unagi and pork belly skewers. The skewers were cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nNext time I would most likely pass on the soft shell crab, and the chicken and cheese skewer. I'm personally not the biggest crab fan but even then it was a bit hard to eat. The crab was divided into four pieces and two were smothered in too much sauce. \n\nService 3/5\nIt was a quiet night but the servers weren't very attentive. Regardless, service was decent as the servers would frequently clear the dishes and not let it stack up. FYI the prices are higher but there is more variety. All in all I would come back if I was in the area.", 4], ["First off, lovely setting and atmosphere, great energy. \n\nWent with our two daughters (10 and 6).

Their Chicken Karaage is a favorite share plate AND their Yaki (grilled) Mochi always brings \"Mmmmmm\" noises from newbies. If you like mackerel order the Saba Shio and a side of rice. A must order is the Grilled Eringi unless you are allergic to mushrooms - so sorry if you are :-(\n\nThe Corn Butter Yaki is tasty but I would order something else if this is your first visit ... like maybe the Mochi Bacon!!!\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their sushi offerings so choose based on your preference. \n\nFor all the grilling which is done in plain sight, you leave without a distinctive odor of smoke on your clothes.

Unique taste and I liked it.\nI ordered beef tongue and chicken gizzard for the yakitori, and I liked the later more. It has a crispy texture to it which I really enjoyed. \nI also tried the Japango roll and their sashimi, I'd say the fish quality is pretty good, but the taste doesn't really stand out? \nPrice is on the higher end for someone with a huge appetite like me.

On ordering a pitcher for 30$, I would expect at least the first one to be poured for me. Simply left stacked glasses.

It was pretty quiet when we placed our orders, but the restaurant was in full swing by the time we left. We ordered the following dishes:\n\n1) Crispy fried chicken wings with garlic soy sauce with house sake ($16) - I liked how they gave us the option of cold or hot sake. Also, you can't really go wrong with fried wings, I enjoyed the sweet soy sauce on top.\n\n2) Japango roll ($15) - I'm a huge fan or torched rolls, as the rich fatty flavours of the raw fish are accentuated in the rice. There wasn't anything too unique about the roll, but it was a tasty combination.\n\n3) Okonomiyaki ($12)  - I love this savoury pancake with the umami-packed sauce and creamy mayo. The okonomiyaki was pretty good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\n4) Yakitori Set A ($18) - The yakitori set includes beef strip loin, pork belly, chicken breast with cheese, scallop and buttered king mushrooms. Our favourite was definitely the pork belly, it had a lovely charcoal flavour with delicious fatty notes and a juicy texture. We ended up getting another order of the delicious pork belly! Other skewers we tried included the hearts with sea salt ($4.5)& Momo mochi ($5.80). I absolutely love mochis as a dessert, but I was quite happy with this grilled and lightly salted version. It paired well with the juicy chicken leg meat.\n\nOverall, Kintaro offers a good variety of menu options, which is ideal for larger groups. This place is definitely a strong contender when we are craving izakaya style food!", 4], ["I love izakaya so I was really excited to try this one on Church! It's a fairly small izakaya restaurant, but it wasn't busy as they had opened an hour before we arrived for dinner service. \n\nTheir menu is really organized, which I appreciated because there's nothing worse than flipping pages and flipping back! They have lots of different choices and things other izakaya's don't have - I definitely recommend their mochi cheese skewers, chicken skin and pork belly!\n\nThey also have all of the soju flavours which my friends and I loved enjoying, but their alcoholic drinks are a bit bland compared to other places. Just means not many flavours! Also, I'd pass on their grape flavoured soju - tastes a bit like medicine! \n\nService is good!

All the food that we tried was really tasty. The only downsides were that it was a little noisy and by the end of the meal we were all really hot. So, while we'll be back, it'll probably be in the fall -- because it was cooler outside last night than it was inside.

We were asked if we had a reservation when we arrived and of course we did not.  The server said that we could take seats at the bar and explained that the empty tables in the restaurant were saved for those with reservations.  Fair enough.  We told the server that we preferred to wait for an empty table.  Sure enough, two minutes later, he told us that we could take one of the empty tables and set it up for us.  We get that restaurants would prefer to have four people at a table for four and appreciate that they were willing to seat us.\n\nWe were brought a bottle of water, which was most welcome after walking around for a good part of the day.  That was followed by beer.  Between us, we tried six dishes and everything we tried was really, really good.  My standout was the Sagari - the meat was sooo tender and flavorful.  The Tori Karaage was tasty if a bit dry, and would have benefited from a side sauce of some sort.\n\nHad we been hungrier, we could have done real damage.  As it was, we found the prices reasonable.

How very Asian of them. At the very last minute, I switched my order to the Set A skewers which included chicken breast with cheese, beef tenderloin, pork belly, mushrooms and scallops. All of them were tender and juicy and nicely salted. It took a while to get to the table but the wait was worth it. It paired perfectly with my Asahi beer. The deep fried squid was delish. My mom ordered the spicy champon and damn, that broth was addictive!

The noodles were on the chewier side which I prefer, and I liked everything in the broth except the imitation seafood item. The broth was not too oily which was nice, and on the thinner side.

The more I dine here the more I fall in love with the food, the decor, and the restaurant overall.\n\nFair warning though, I'm not the only one who loves Campechano! Make reservations in advance because the wait can be up to an hour sometimes without one. If you're looking to make reservations for a Friday or Saturday night, I recommend booking at least a week before.\n\nThe decor is simple and bright. Unlike other taco places, they don't dim their lights too much at night so you don't have to worry about squinting to see in front of you. The restaurant is quite small so it can feel a bit cramped when it gets busy, especially when you have to get up from the table. It's not too big of an issue when you're seated though! The servers are friendly and decently attentive, especially for a busy restaurant. Prices are fair when comparing to other sit-down taco places like La Carnita and El Catrin.\n\nFor starters, the chips and guacamole is a must-have. The guacamole is topped with a seasonal garnish. Last time I went it was pomegranate seeds, which gives it a nice sweet crunch. Their homemade chips are unlike your regular tortilla chips. They are so crispy and yummy, I would happily just come for the chips alone. They also offer refills of the chips, which makes them even more amazing!\n\nThe tacos are just as good as the guacamole. The tortilla (also homemade) for the tacos is so good and really ties every taco together nicely. I love the Carnitas (confit pork shoulder) and the Barbacoa (braised lamb leg). If you like spicy, the Pollo Al Pastor (chicken thigh) will set your mouth on fire! The fish taco is also quite good. It tastes fresh and is fried to perfection. It's a definite must for someone who doesn't like spice.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of tacos, Campechano is a must-try! You won't be disappointed!", 5], ["Why do they put guacamole on tacos al pastor???? Ugh. \nGood Barbacoa. \nGood Jamaica juice. \nDubious service.", 3], ["After hearing so much buzz about Campechano both online and among my colleagues, I was ecstatic to finally come here and give it a try. Though I had high expectations, I did not leave disappointed! The vibe of the small place was fantastic, and suffice it to say that the food really stood out (particularly the corn masa tortillas made in-house)!\n\nI had a reservation for 6:30PM, and although there were still some seats when we arrived, there was a line by the time it was 7PM. After asking the server what was popular, my friend and I quickly ordered some tacos each. We shared the guac & chips, and both got the barbacoa (lamb leg with spicy guajillo and jalapeno) and carnitas (pulled pork shoulder with salsa verde), but she also got an additional vegetarian rajas (poblano peppers with cojita cheese).\n\nGuac - It was super interesting to see the guac topped with pomegranate seeds, which added a beautiful pop of vibrant colour and burst of sweet flavour! The guac was good, the chips were delicious, but we adored the smoky dip that accompanied the duo.\n\nBarbacoa - Came with huge and meaty chunks of tender lamb leg. I loved the gamey taste, though the creamy, spicy dressing was a little too heavy for me. That said, this was one of my favourites just because it was so comforting and filling!\n\nCarnitas - Similar to the barbacoa, there were generous and copious amounts of confit pulled pork. Although this was dressed with only salsa verde, I found it to feel a little heavier - mostly because with every bite came a healthy gush of oil drizzling down my chin. It was definitely less spicy, and you could taste the different flavours more!\n\nRajas - I sampled one bite of my friend's, and found it to be an interesting combination of spicy and sweet (from the peppers). Though this was our least favourite, she did say that when she got to the centre, the melted cheese mixed with the sweet peppers and hot spices was a pretty good combination. \n\nAfter finishing, my friend and I thoroughly debriefed on our experiences, and our thoughts were:\n- The masa tortillas were FANTASTIC. It was both soft and yielding, sturdy enough to hold all the fillings and sauces without being soggy.\n- We really appreciated that the toppings/fillings were simple - my friend pointed out that the tacos didn't have any of the heavy, creamy aioli common at other establishments\n- We would most definitely come again!!!

Friends and I shared sangria, good typical sangria. I also tried the pineapple mojito I think it was, and it was so good! Our table ordered about 2-3 tacos each. I'd say for myself 3 was good enough. We also shared the ceviche appetizer. I would have to say the tinga was so good, the chipotle shrimp, and I also had one of the beef ones which I can't remember but they made it mild for us. Some of them were still spicy but it had a good kick. They are a bit on the salty side though. \n\nWill definitely be back. Really enjoyed our dinner. Saw some big groups there so I'd recommend for a large party! Ps. They also have a patio but didn't get to see how big or nice it was.", 5], ["Came for all the positive reviews on yelp but this place didn't really impress me.\n\nFirst, their service is not bad but definitely lack of organization skills. We called the place at 5:30 or 6 pm, see if it's possible to make a reservation at 7pm. But we were told that the place gets really busy on a Thursday night, so they didn't let us make a reservation until 8:45 pm and surely that's so late for a dinner! So me and my friend decided to show up at 7:30 anyways, if we couldn't get a table we would dinning in elsewhere. \n\nSo we arrived the place at roughly 7:40, the dinning area (inside) was completely empty, and even the patio only has like 5 tables (two persons per table, so I0 customers?). I would not call this busy but perhaps they have a different definition in terms of busy. \n\nThe atmosphere though, is lovely. when you walked into the restaurant you would see most of the wall has hand paintings on. I found this pretty attractive. And sure this place would be a great spot to hang out and grab a drink. \n\nIt's nice weather so we sat at the patio, and between the two of us we had 5 tacos, two drinks and a guacamole to share. Their taco is average size and you probably would need 2-3 tacos to make enough for a meal. \n\nLet's start with the guacamole ($8). I think it's a little pricy but I like how they had pomegranate seed in it, love that touch of sweetness. I found the chips thou, is a little too hard, but it's free to refill!! And I do end up liking the guacamole more than the tacos they served. \n\nThey only serve corn tortillas shell. And they only served two tacos at a time (one for each of us) so the table wouldn't be filled with plates as the tables there are tiny. \n\nWe had Bistec (sirloin), Carnitas (pork shoulder), Barbacoa (braised lamb), Camarones (shrimps) and Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish). \n\nI think both Carnitas (pork shoulder) $5 and Barbacoa (braised lamb) $6.5, had the best value and they also tasted the best. Chunks of juicy meat, and the lime juice balanced out the flavour. But the lamb taste is a little plain, need a pint of salt perhaps to kick the fav more. \n\nBistec (sirloin) $7, slightly pricy. With this price I expected there would be a little bit more meat or the meat were not so grounded. They chopped up the meat into very small pieces, but I guess this is how people make authentic Mexican taco? But the most surprising part is, I'm pretty sure I ordered the non spicy  one. But one bite of this taco surely burnt my month and stomach. I admit I have a very low tolerance, but maybe they should warn others that even the non spicy sirloin taco is sort of spicy? \n\nCamarones (shrimp) $7, the shrimp didn't came in a whole pieces but they chopped it up into small pieces! And the portion they gave this time was nothing like what the others post on yelp before. I'm sure there is probably only 2.5 -3 small shrimp in the taco. But that's not the worst part, this taco was another fire in the mouth. It was so spicy I couldn't even tastes what's in the taco honestly. They should really adjust the spicy level. \n\nLastly we had the Pescado (beer battered branzino, fried fish) $8. I think $8 is pretty pricey for taco and also because it didn't taste great. The deep fried layer was so hard,  it's almost like chewing fried cardboard. And pink pickle radish on top was super sour! I didn't like this at all. But I guess it was a mistake to order fried fish in a Mexican place, although the taco itself looks gorgeous.\n\nI cannot say I'm a big fan of Mexican food or I really know what's authentic Mexican food, but I know next time if I want taco I would go seven lives and or else where. Just because they have better value. But this place for sure it's still a great spot to hang out.", 3], ["This is my favorite taco place ever. I know, bold statement right? Obviously just my opinion but grand electric, seven lives, la carnita don't even come close to the flavor, spice , and prices here. Must haves every time are the sea bass ceviche, bistec, and costilla. If you're not into spicy, these probably aren't for you. Will be coming back again and again.", 5], ["I was a little apprehensive because I love tacos SO much and didn't want to get my hopes up. Thankfully Campechano is awesome. The restaurant is nice and cozy with super loud music that didn't irritate me for some reason and only accepts cash and debit.\n\nThe earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.\n\nThe food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.\n\nMy ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :P\n\nWe ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).\n\nWith two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.\n\nWe will definitely come back for a chill date night, small birthday party or to try out the patio in the summer.", 5], ["One of the best tacos in town I have found after moving here from LA\nVery difficult to find good tacos in Toronto", 5], ["One of the best taco places in Toronto, yet underrated. Skip Wilbur and Baro and come here. \n\nEvery time I go the ceviche is fresh and the tacos are delicious. Try the spicy margherita! It won't disappoint. \n\nA little sad their prices went up - so you can expect to pay 7 bucks a taco. \n\nGood for a casual meal and fun times with friends!", 4], ["Just a quick note. \nMe and my father arrived at 2:31 and were denied service.  My father has a bad leg and cundo only walk slowly. I send so many people to your establishment when asked what the best tacos in the hood.  They could of been a little lenient. Dissatisfied.", 1], ["LOVE LOVE LOVE. Campechano is a hip Mexican sit down restaurant that serves a selection of tacos. I got the Carnitas and Tinga de Pollo for $5 each and we also shared guacamole ($7) with the complimentary chips appetizer.\n\nCampechano Taqueria appears very modest from the outside, and it's fairly easy to miss it, but definitely a place to try for locals. I came here during lunch and although there's not many spots to sit, I didn't see anyone needing to wait at the doors. Sometimes, you may be seated at large picnic tables, of which, you may have the chance to share this with another party. The environment is hip, with fiesta music, casual and lively. If you don't have space to put your coats, they have coat hangers located next to your seats, so you won't have to worry about needing to hold your stuff while you're enjoying your tacos. \n\nThe chips came in a cute blue mug and there was a ton of non-salty but seasoned guac on the side. The tacos are slightly spicy, but down-diggity delicious. A soft shelled taco wrapped with meat, veggies and drizzled in delicious sauce. The sauce is rather viscous, so for the most part, this was one of the cleanest tacos I've ever had. I highly recommend the Carnitas. The Tina de Pollo wasn't a favourite of mine, but it was still delicious! I recommend ordering two tacos without the guac, or just one taco with the guac because it can get super filling!!", 5], ["Hands down, THE BEST TACOS & MARGARITAS IN TORONTO or ever probably. The tortilla was warm, the filling was a lot but perfect. More filling the better! It amazes me that the tortilla doesn't break apart because you get to eat the whole thing without any of the filling falling out.\nAll of the tacos are great but my top two favourite is Carnita Taco and I forget the name, but the filling comes with mushroom, bacon, and some sort of cream. I'm not a fan of spicy at all, and the menu doesn't say it is spicy, but it was HOT when I had it. I couldn't not eat it because it was just too good.\n\nNot only was the tacos good. But the margaritas were awesome! The last two times I've gone, I got 2 or 3 margaritas, because it was that good! \n\nA little downside though, I just wish that they would serve you more chips with the guacamole. It is quite tiny, that you would have to buy another one, especially if you're sharing 3 or more people.\n\nThe place is quite small so I do recommend making reservations!\nAlso, what's awesome is, my boyfriends family met the owner in Taiwan and if it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't have found my go-to taco and margarita place!", 5], ["Okay so I used to love this place, and it was my go to for a taco fix with delicious margaritas. Every time I've been it has been brimming with people, but on my last visit it was half empty on a Thursday evening. I ordered my favourite (the sopa) with a number of different tacos- steak, chicken, fish, etc. The sopa arrived lukewarm for some reason, and the steak taco was tough as if it was cooked earlier in the day and reheated. Otherwise the chicken tings and fish tacos were relish as expected. Maybe it was an off night. Too bad because this was my favourite Mexican in the city and has otherwise been consistently amazing.", 3], ["I have to start by saying the tacos here are pretty darn good. Maybe some of the best I've had in the city so far. They do justice to the tortilla which can sadly be overlooked elsewhere. But... damn are they on the pricey side. Ranging from $5 - $7.50 I think you would need at least 3 to make a meal. I had two at lunch, plus sharing a guacamole with my lunching companions and I wasn't exactly 'too full'. The Carnitas was really good and the Barbacoa (braised Lamb) was pretty good as well (if not a touch on the salty side). Since when has the humble taco been turned into a luxury food? The service was good and the place is nicely appointed (maybe a little too nicely). \n\nBut I have to say - please stop serving your beer pints in enamel tins cups! Maybe it looks cool (it doesn't), but every sip of beer is going to have a 'tin' taste to it. \n\nI will be back, but I have to save up some money first (and I'll bring my own beer glass).", 3], ["The Barabcoa alone is to die for!!!! The guacamole was great but I'd add a little squeeze of lime if you get a chance. The tacos aren't overloaded and makes it easy to eat.... and easier to eat more than 2!", 5], ["Great ceviche and tasty tacos. The tortillas were cold though and the chips would taste better if they were warm (like at Playa Caba\u00f1a). Good service and cheerful music. The place is small and gets packed really fast. Reservations are recommended.", 4], ["This taco restaurant recently opened just up the street/around the corner from Valdez, Gusto 101, and other popping King Street favourites, on the quieter corner of Adelaide and Portland. It's a small, cozy establishment that is bursting with personality - bright murals on the wall, and the entire time my friends and I were there, they were playing the most fantastic reggaeton jams, so good times abounded.\n\nTheir menu is pretty small right now (about 6 different tacos and maybe 4 different quesadillas), so if you come with a medium to large sized group, you can try pretty much everything. With two other friends, I tried the following:\n\nApps: guacamole and ceviche - These both came as decently sized portions, lots of nacho chips on the side, and were good for sharing. In the end we even requested for a refill of chips, which they gladly obliged for free. The guac was very fresh (although could have used a bit more seasoning), while the ceviche was a little heavy on the vinegar or lemon juice or whatever they put in there, as there was a bit more sourness than I was expecting. It wasn't bad though, and the fish, which I think was halibut, seemed decently fresh. The nacho chips might have also been made in-house, because they were very crispy and fresh, although had a bit too much salt on them.\n\nWe ordered a whole bunch of tacos and one quesadilla. In the end I tried two tacos: one with pineapple, shrimp and chipotle sauce, and the other one was the vegetarian taco with corn, mushrooms and peppers, which I got on the recommendation from the restaurant owner. I enjoyed both of them - both were delicious and flavourful, and tasted very fresh. I really do think the vegetarian taco was the most unique I've ever had... it almost felt/tasted like I was eating cream of mushroom soup wrapped in a taco shell. Very interesting, I will say that, but it tasted good. The taco shells used were AMAZING though, they were thick and doughy and not dry at all... apparently they make them by hand here, starting by grinding the corn themselves and everything. SO GOOD.\n\nWe saved enough room for dessert just so we could try the two they had on the menu - flan, and a lemon cake of some sort. I really really enjoyed both of them! The flan was a bit unique, because as the owner explained to us, it was a bit denser than a normal flan and kind of a cross between a flan and panna cotta... like almost like a mousse cake. But it really worked for me, because I don't like it when the texture is too runny or custard-y, so this really hit the spot, and it was also not TOO sweet. The lemon cake was very zesty and refreshing, had almost like a meringue or pavlova-like texture (which I normally don't like), but it had enough cake-iness to it that I was able to enjoy it.\n\nOverall, I REALLY enjoyed my meal here. Everyone working here was super friendly and very attentive, and as other Yelpers mentioned, the vibe is just chill and totally unpretentious, which was very refreshing. Since the place is fairly new, they are still working out some kinks and are very open to suggestions - we suggested that they either put sauce on the side or offer different levels of spiciness, because most of us found the sauces they used to be too spicy. I absolutely would come back here again though, as there are plenty of other tacos and quesadillas which I want to try! Also prices are very reasonable, as tacos are between $4-6 max each. I ended up paying around $20 for two tacos, splitting the apps with my friends, a juice/agua, and splitting desserts. All in all, a pretty good deal!", 4], ["A few notices:\n- cash and Canadian debit only (should not really impact too many people)\n- no reservations\n\n\nFood (4.5 stars):\n+ very high quality tacos.\n- expensive. Tacos range from 4.50 to 6.50 Each portions comes with a single taco.  \nI ended up ordering european fish taco (4.5 star) and a shrimp taco.  The shrimp taco (3 stars) was super spicy but tasty.  The fish taco was good.  I also ended up ordering and splitting guacamole (5 stars) as well.  The bill came to $15 before the tip.\n\n\nAtmosphere (4 stars):\nThe atmosphere is very simple and cosy, the front room with the open kitchen has seating for around 20 people. There is also a backroom is a bit more spacious with 3 tables for 6, and one table for 2.  \nThis is not a great place for large groups, but a good place to go with a few people for lunch.  \n\nService (5 stars):\nThe waitress got us right away water with 2 bottles on the side so we can refill it ourselves.  \nAfter we ordered, she gave the appetizers first, then the first taco to everyone, then once we finished the second taco.  Due to the table not being super large this helped the dining experience.", 4], ["3.5*. Pretty good! I still prefer Wilbur around the corner, but this place was decent, and is definitely a King West-area spot you should try at least once! We arrived around 6:30 PM on a Friday night and it was very busy. We reserved in advance and we were seated right away. \n\nFirst, ambiance and service. Good, attentive service, but almost to a fault. Our server tried very hard to upsell their menu, even though we clearly tried to tell her we didn't want to order anymore. Ambiance was casual, lively, with a very neighborhood/community feel to it - some tables are pretty close together, so it makes for a nice intimate environment. \n\nSecond, the food. We ordered Guacamole ($6.00) to start, and 3 tacos (Tinga De Pollo ($4.75), Bistec ($4.75), and the Campechano ($5.00)). Overall, pretty good but not the best. We've definitely had better guacamole elsewhere - it lacked flavour and value to portion size wasn't the best. The tacos were decent and portion size was fine - our favourite was the Bistec. Good flavour, but not the best tacos we've had.\n\nOverall, a good spot for a nice casual dinner out - the place was full of families, couples, and groups of friends. It's a nice spot for a nice easygoing meal.", 3], ["An excellent restaurant where the owner and staff truly understand the meaning of fine dining.

The venison was definitely an adventurous options but there were no regrets there as it was cooked very well and made for a sumptuous main. Dessert also did not disappoint (with the only downside being that I wish there was more of it!). Overall and excellent meal with outstanding service and a very extensive wine selection, which will definitely bring me back here again.", 5], ["3.5/5 Found out about this place after hearing many stories about their extensive wine list and huge wine cellar located in the basement of the restaurant. I came here with a group of six on a Monday night - it wasn't too busy. \n\nFOOD: 3/5\nWe decided to begin our meal with five appetizers, Tuna Crudo and quail egg with pommel Frites ($23), braised rabbit and strozzapreti noodles with arugula ($24), tartare of beer with bay scallop ceviche and yuzu ($24), baby lettuces and vegetable chips with champagne vinaigrette ($16), and heirloom tomatoes and plums with shaved beets and mozzarella ($25). I enjoyed the pommel Frites for the Tuna Crudo - it gave it the dish a good crunch. The braised rabbit resembled the taste of shredded chicken mixed with pasta. A personal opinion on the beef tartare, I felt like it had too many onions and was missing an egg yolk. However, the bay scallop ceviche and yuzu were paired very well. As for the salad, I was not a huge fan of the champagne vinaigrette. The vegetable chips, however, were a nice replacement for the classic croutons. Among the five appetizers, my favourite dish was the heirloom tomatoes that were topped off with fresh mozzarella - delicious! \n\nMoving onto our main courses, we decided to share four dishes and a saut\u00e9 of mushrooms with white wine and chive butter ($13). We found the mushrooms to be extremely salty and requested for it to be remade. After having it remade, the mushrooms were still too salty and our server insisted to have it remade, again. While the server walked back to the kitchen with the mushroom, we overheard someone yell, \"I said less salt, what's going on, Jesus fucking Christ\" - quite unprofessional, I must say. After seeing many pictures of the rack of lamb and roast tomato couscous with mint ($49), we decided that it was going to be a must get. We ordered the lamb to be made medium rare, but the bottom pieces were served as a medium - slightly too overcooked for our liking. Another meat we ordered was the aged prime striploin on horseradish pur\u00e9e with beets and dill pollen ($49). This was, by far, my favourite dish for the night. The crust of the steak was phenomenal and came with a strong buttery scent. Additionally, we ordered two fish, fog island cod on fava bean risotto with truffle jus ($44) and their special fish for the day, pickerel. Again, sad to say, but the cod was also overcooked - tasting very stiff and dry. The pickerel, on the other hand, was cooked much better and wasn't too overcooked. \n\nFinally, ending our meal with some dessert. We ordered the London fog (early grey) ice cream ($10.50), passion fruit sorbet ($10.50), and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with mixed berries and macaron ($10.50). The service was absolutely amazing and very attentive. Overall, I would say I had a decent experience. If I were to go back, it would definitely be for the aged prime striploin.", 3], ["This is a top notch fine dining restaurant where everything works to perfection: reception, service, food, all perfect.

I must say that I was quit disappointed in my choice of the bisque as it was very grainy, and bland overall. My colleagues who chose the salad concurred that it was overdressed and evented wilted.\n\nFor our mains, we chose between a Fogo Island Cod with cauliflowers with white lentils Vadouvan and lime  (my choice), prime striploin on mushroom couscous with parsley and garlic, or a ravioli dish. I believe all of us chose between the cod or striploin. Overall, my dish wash very disappointing. The beautiful cod I was expecting came as a disassembled filet, and was broken up (not intentionally) over the the lentils and cauliflower. There were no spices, sauces, or event salt added to this dish. It was a waste of a beautiful fish.

We had a bottle of wine 2004 Merlot from California and it was great with dinner.\n\nStaff\nThe staff was very courteous and friendly.  They were very hospitable and was very attentive to our needs.  They consistently visited our table to refill our wine glasses and water.  Overall customer service is on point.\n\nVery classy atmosphere and the set up allowed us to feel like we had our own private space.\n\nThis will definitely become a regular spot for us.", 5], ["My husband and I were in the neighbourhood, we used Yelp to find a restaurant for dinner and we were delighted with our choice. We had the fresh oysters appetizer - the red wine mignonette sauce was delicious and I am not that fond of mignonette sauce. My husband had the venison and I had the prime strip loin. I like my steak medium rare and it was done perfectly. My husband's venison was melt in your mouth tender. For dessert, we shared the chocolate truffle tort with whites chocolate ice cream. The chocolate flavour was very intense - which was a good thing. The service was attentive without being intrusive and my husband was very impressed with how speedy they were. Definitely worth every star of the 5.", 5], ["The best Foie Gras in town! Valentines dinner and can't wait to come back again. \n\nAppetizers:\nFoie Gras over mapled apples on a bed of delicious current puree sauce. Had to restrain ourselves from ordering another before our main entrees. The snow crab appetizer followed suit which was also shelled and paired nicely with an artichoke salad. \n\nSpecials: \nWe selected the PEI oysters which were served nicely with a tasty shallot vinaigrette and the usual toppings. Very fresh and not too wild of a taste. \n\nMains:\nRack of Lamb: cooked medium and was perfect! I dislike eggplants and Opus was kind enough to replace with other vegetables.(Service was 10/10)\n\nStriploin: recommended to cook as medium rare and it was made perfectly! Amazing flavour and tender in the centre. \n\nWine: Pinot noir, Duckhorn Migration. Paired well with our mains and Foie gras. \n\nOverall 10/10 for service, food and ambience. We asked about Brunch and they only serve Dinner after 5pm.", 5], ["Lovely.... simply lovely.  This is an elegant experience with gorgeous and very enjoyable food.  Beautiful atmosphere with spot-on service.  The food is visually stunning, and follows through in taste.  Truly a memorable experience.", 5], ["I love this place, I first came in 1997 and still as good or better, and the owners are always there to make sure you have a good experience. I could eat the foie grass  all day.", 5], ["Pizza perfection. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. This Detroit style pizza is incredible. I waited about a month before I wrote this review because I was going to Detroit to try Detroit pizza. I went to two of the most popular places in Detroit and my conclusion is that Descendant DSP is superior. The caramelization on the crust is so delicious, it gives you a taste that's hard to put into words. \nI ordered the pepperoni for my first time. They do have other selections, but the simple pepperoni pie is a good pizza to start with. \nI've tried many styles of pizza in their hometown (Chicago, New York, Naples, Rome) and this pizza is a life changer. YOU MUST TRY IT!", 5], ["So after reading about this place I decided to make the trek down.  Once you locate the place the next task is to find suitable parking. If you are familiar with the east end then it will be no surprise that if you see a spot take it.  \n\nThe place is a store front pizza place with seating for about 15-20 people.  \n\nAside from wine they offer a good selection of craft beers.  I also tried their root beer.  Very different and tasty. \n\nThe pizza I chose was the double pepperoni.  It was very good.  My wife loved the nice chewy crust. The daughter enjoyed her slices but wasn't keen with the red sauce placed on top like a garnish. She wore most of her red sauce.  \n\nI have had pizza from Pizza UNO in Chicago and this by far was a better pizza.  I did feel the price was tipping to $$$ per person but if you are out on Queen Street East it is worth checking out.", 4], ["I've gotten a table there once - we normally do take out.\n\nIt's absolutely delicious and unlike other pizza I've had.\n\nIt's heavy so be prepared to eat -  you also won't eat as many slices as you normally would on a thin crust pizza", 5], ["Did I not review this yet?!?\n\nIt's been a couple months since I was last there but I can still remember the taste perfectly. Even if you're not a typical fan of pan pizza, they may make a believer out of you. It's very much \"fork and knife\" pizza and each piece has to weigh a couple pounds, yet (for me) it still goes down easy.\n\nWe went with the 'No Name' pizza. The ingredients (from the website) are: cheese blend, Ezzo pepperoni, house made fennel sausage, sauce, post-oven ricotta dollops, Mike's Hot Honey, fresh herbs, pecorino, calabrian chilies. If those ingredients sounds good, I can tell you that paired together in person, it's even better than you'd imagine. What still stands out in mind memory was the sauce mixed with the chilies and the hot honey and then tempered with the ricotta. \n\nIt's clear that they not only put emphasis on good ingredients, but there's a lot of thought put into pairing them together. Based on what's listed for the Jaffna pizza, I'm dying to try that too and I wouldn't normally be clamoring for a vegetarian pizza. \n\nSuch a shame that it's pretty far for me, but I still need to find my way back here soon...and back again. If the prices seem high, note that not only are they using great ingredients, but two slices really is a large portion. Split a large 3 ways and you're only spending about $12/person.", 5], ["HOLY SH*T! This pizza is incredible. If you haven't tried it you must go. Go fast. The crust is absolute perfection - thick and fluffy but crispy and delicious at the same time. I've been about 4 times thusfar, and each time is consistently delicious.\n\n1) Pepperoni - cheesy, cup-shaped pepperoni, delicious.\n2) Special of the day - wow I wish this one was permanent, it had white barbecue sauce, pickled onions and braised beef; I'd say one of the best pizzas I've had.\n\nThe space is small with few seats, not sure if they take reservations, we've usually walked in at obscure times and been able to get a spot. The one time I went when it was super busy was about a 20 minute wait, but worth it. I do see ubereats/foodora drivers coming in so you can order it through that too. Not cheap at all, but definitely filling and worth it in my opinion. Also, it takes a decent amount of time to get the order as they make it on the spot.", 5], ["I really enjoyed this pizza restaurant. It has a nice vibe and delicious Detroit style pizza!

This place was amazing ! I still have dreams about it ! I swear ! I have never tried Detroit style pizza before but this will never be my last! My favorite is the caramelized crust. The No Name got our attention with giant dollops of ricotta cheese and Mikes Hot Honey !! After coming here, I bought mikes hot honey for now all mY pizza needs ! I can't emphasize enough how great this pizza is. It's a small location with very friendly staff. Overall highly recommend!", 5], ["Came to Toronto on a hunt for some pizza, can never go wrong with Detroit style pizza! Corner piece is the best \n\nI was unable to go pick it up so I used UberEATS for it to be delivered to the convention center. If you order deliver takes about an hour which isn't too bad. \n\nI ordered a small pepperoni and small gatt-daddy (Italian sausage) , which was 4 pieces each. Pizza was still warm upon arrival and was very good! Crust was crunchy and cheese was still cheesy.", 5], ["One of the best pizzas in the city. I have only tried the Barese and Truff-Ghi, but boy oh boy were they delicious. The Barese is a great choice if you want to eat a pizza that is a little more risque than your run of the mill pepperoni pizza. It includes peppers and olives to add a little kick and brininess to the pizza. The truffle pizza was very good as well, it can get a little rich due to the creaminess and truffle, but if you are a mushroom/truffle lover, its a must try. Not sure how they do the crust, but it was amazing. Can't explain, just got to try it :)", 5], ["Friend of a friend recommended it and make sure you go there with an appetite! The atmosphere was great and the decor appealing. We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for the food to arrive but the restaurant was busy and the pizza needed time to cook. The food arrived and couldn't wait to dig on. We barely ate one slice and we were already talking about the next pizzas we would buy when we go back! \n\nThe prices are reasonable for the size of the dish. A small pizza can feed 1-2 people if you have a small appetite or order an appetizer. Big appetite? You can eat that small pizza (shown in the pictures all to yourself). The restaurant is small and fills up quickly so be sure to reserve a seat, or simply call in your order in advance and take it to go.", 5], ["Ended up at Descendant Detroit Style Pizza because of a recommendation from a friend and it was so worth it!! Got there around 4:45 on a Sunday and the place was full, FYI it's not the biggest space, they can probably fit around 20-25 people max in the restaurant. Luckily a couple was leaving so we got a table almost instantly but anyone that came in after us were put on a wait list and told how long it would be, they also take your number and then either call or text you when it's time to come back for your table. But it's definitely worth the wait!! They also take pick up orders if you don't want to go and sit in the restaurant or wait for a table. \n\nMy friend tried the whiskey beer and I got the cola that they have in store and they were both awesome!! Now let's talk about the pizza!!! They have two sizes, small (8x10) and large (10x14). The small has 4 square slices and the large has 6 square slices. Since there was two of us we got 2 smalls so we can try different pizzas. \n\nOur one pizza was called ELECTRIC AVENUE which had\njerk chicken, fresh pineapple, curried lime aioli, green onion, Mama Lil's Peppers, Diablo's Fuego hot sauce (first picture) and our second pizza was the special that they had, which I forgot to take a picture of the description but it had mushrooms and sausage and truffle sauce. They were both so good but the electric avenue I think was my favourite!! The pizzas are nice and deep but not so much that you feel like you're only eating dough and they are all generously topped with lots of the ingredients, they don't shy away. The fresh shaved mozzarella on top was a great touch!!!! \n\nWe were definitely full after eating there and if your going on your own a small is perfect and a large would be great for leftovers for the next day. \n\nI definitely want to go back and try all their other types of pizzas that they have (8 of them)", 5], ["Really good deep dish pizza.  I ordered the No Name pizza and my friends ordered the Funghi Truffle Pizza.  Both were really flavourful. I highly recommend just ordering a small.  It was perfect for two people. If you want more pizzas, keep ordering small so you can taste a little bit of each.\n\nI ordered the No Name pizza because the server said it ha the most meat. \n\nService was amazing. We never had to call for our waiter for extra water or utensils. They are really professional and kept refilling our waters before we finish.  They provided excellent service and were very nice.  \n\nOne thing I would critique would be to get better knives. We had to cut really hard to cut into our pizzas. Our pizzas were not pre-cut.", 5], ["Went into this location after seeing the many amazing pictures and reviews on both Instagram and Yelp. \n\nIt's a small location, and there weren't many seating inside, however it was still comfortable with a very welcoming atmosphere.

Not to mention however, the pizza looked amazing. \n\nI loved the mix of sweet and heat in the pizza, and it was nice and cheesy. However, I did not expect the sweetest in it, and that could have contributed to my lack of excitement that followed my first bite. I loved the crust and enjoyed the pizza overall. I even ordered one to take out for my family to try since my roots go back to Jaffna, they enjoyed it as well, but similar to me, we were not a fan of the sweetness in the pizza. \n\nWill definitely go back, but maybe get the small size next time and maybe try something else from the menu, possibly the Electric Avenue.", 4], ["After hearing about the many praises about this joint, we decided to check it out before heading to a concert. We ordered the Mushroom Pizza & the Electric Avenue. The restaurant is incredibly small, with about 25 seats. The pizza is definitely very heavy, and filled to the brim with toppings. My only concern was that the pricing seemed a bit high for what it is, each small pizza was ~$20+ and larges ~$35+. Although I enjoyed my meal, this would definitely be a one time thing.", 3], ["This was my first time eating 'Detroit Style Pizza.' Full disclosure - I love pizza and could probably eat for all three meals in a day so I was surprised that I had not heard about this style of pizza before. \n\nFor a Saturday evening, it was quite busy. They do both take-out and dine-in; for the latter, making a reservation is recommended. We waited for about half an hour before I got the call that a table was available. Fortunately, the turnover rate is quick as the menu has only pizza. \n\nWe ordered two different types of pizza to share - the No Name and Truff-Ghi. Both pizzas were very different (taste wise), but delicious nonetheless. For the No Name, the drops of ricotta was a nice touch. There was a generous portion of meat (sausage and pepperoni) on the pizza. With the 'hot honey' and chilies, the No Name had a nice kick to it. The Truff-Ghi had a more sweeter taste to it. Bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions go very well together. The pizza also had a white truffle sauce, which was unique. The lemon zest was a nice touch as well. Order a small size (4 slices) as the pizza is thick with a lot of toppings; you will definitely have some leftovers to take home. I would like to return to try their other pizzas as my first experience was a positive one. \n\nGood for: pizza", 4], ["Oooof, just writing this makes me full yet salivate (is that even possible?!)\n\nI ordered this via UberEats to share with a 5 others coworkers and boy were we stuffed with some ONE square each.\n\nWe got the TRUFF-GHI and LOVED it. I'm not a pizza expert so I can't really tell the difference between this and chicago deep dish (except for the shape), but I would definitely say that this is less thick and tomato-y so you really can taste the toppings and the dough throughout each bite.\n\nThe fact that I got this via delivery and still enjoyed it says a lot. It certainly has me coming back again, and next time, I'm going to bring more people so we can at least try two different flavors.", 4], ["Gourmet Pizza out in the east end.

Serves you half a pie or a full pie (half ranging from 18-22$? to a full which comes to about 35$) - A little 'pricey' but for gourmet pizza, it is DEFINITELY worth it.\n\nWe ordered the Truffle-Ghi as we love truffles. This is a white based pizza.. and let me tell you; TRY THIS IF YOU LOVE TRUFFLES!\n\nIt was SO delicious, and we ordered  a half and couldn't even finish it.

It is SO thick and I don't think any normal person could finish a whole small by themselves. We all ended up have 3 slices. It was yummy.

Note that one large and one small was way too much for three people! The portion sizes are very generous, so I'd recommend two smalls for three people, or one large and one small for four.

The crust was thick and doughy with burnt cheese on the edges so yummy. Highly recommend this low key place. They also had a great selection of drinks and beer. We had Vernors which was priced very reasonably.  All in all a good spot if you are looking for just pizza and beer with friends. Not good for large groups but good for a casual date nightie just hanging with a few friends.", 5], ["Descendent is my new go-to pizza place...I didn't even know that Detroit-style pizza was a thing!

This place is far from downtown, east of Queen St E and DV but easy to find parking. A small restaurant, sits at most 24 people in either 2-seats tables or one large 6-seats table. We saw a lot of people do take-out on a Sunday night, so definitely popular for the area. The open kitchen and dark and eclectic decor makes it seem like a young hip restaurant. \n\nWe got greeted by a young eager guy who was able to describe the sizes of the pieces--which come in either small or large. We ended up ordering the small White Pie ($16) and small Sweet Corn Pie ($16). I was hoping for the Hawaiian but they seem to not have that tonight. \n\nI don't know whether or not it was because I was tired from work or we were both really hungry, but I felt our two small pizzas took way too long to arrive at our table. Maybe 20 minutes? I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt but in my opinion, pizza shouldn't take that long to cook, especially in an extremely hot pizza oven, which averages 450-500 deg F, but the customers beside us that arrived after we finished our pizzas seemed to get their pizzas in under 10 min. Maybe they were busy with take-out orders? \n\nThe pies were definitely tasty and flavourful but not the best ones I've had due to a few flaws.  The crust is for sure original--thick and super crispy with cheese. The inner part of the pie was very doughy and some may even say undercooked but I actually like doughy pies so not a problem for me. The Sweet Corn Pie had corn beschamel sauce, loads of cheese, smoked bacon and some sweet chilis on top. Overall a good flavour combination but I was expecting an intense sweet corn flavour, especially from the beschamel. Most of what I could taste is cream and cheese (from the beschamel), and little bits of corn and chilis every other bite. I'd suggest to the chefs to try and get more corn flavour in there. I mean if you are advertising Corn, I'd better be getting lots of corn flavour! \n\nI liked the White Pie better. Loads of mozzarella  and ricotta cheese, well done carmelized onions and arugula on top. This is the first pie I thought that was too much stringy cheese but with the sweet carmelized onions and the bitter sharp argula on top, I liked this balance in flavours. But again, the inside part of the pie dough was undercooked. The crust was done the same, crispy, cheesy and very greasy.  \n\nThey offered us a free Italian chocolate pudding. Super sweet, creamy, rich chocolate with salt on top. The salt really made it. A very nice dessert. \n\nOne annoyance I have to mention. I noticed other tables were getting a bottle of some hot sauce. When I asked a server about it, he said it was their signature honey hot sauce. So I asked if I could try it. He squeezed some into a small container instead of bringing the entire bottle.  I didn't say anything because he brought it as we were finishing our last two pieces of pie but how rude, can't even bother bringing us the entire bottle. What, you think I'm going to eat it all or steal it home? This left a bitter taste in my mouth in terms of their service. Both servers try hard to be nice but I felt service was lacking and did not match up to the food. Perhaps I'll just get take out next time and not leave tip for dine-in.", 4], ["Decent pizza, terrible service. Ordered a pizza and they told me to pick it up in 15 minutes.

Definitely not a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and they are wondering what you were doing there (I'm here to dine what do you think?).\n\nNext we get to the food which is the best part of the story. My friend ordered scrambled eggs but when the order came they had given her sunny side up. She notified the waitress who exchanged it for her but there was no apology or any emotion whatsoever for the mix up. The waitress simply brought it back and dropped it off at her table. Mix ups happen so my friend let it go but next she described how poorly done the food was. The scrambled eggs were not actually scrambled and the salad was not done very well either. The food just didn't look appetizing. If that was not bad enough my friend found a CURLED UP WORM on her salad. She thought it might have been a rock or something but nope it was moving so definitely not a dead worm either. Unless the worm was part of the ingredients list then this is totally unacceptable and disgusting. Again when my friend informed the waitress they told her she did not have to pay for the meal but again NO APOLOGY or any concern that there was a worm in the customer's food.

I had the fried chicken boneless sandwich and my friend had just the fried chicken (she could not finish so I had the leftovers the next day) and I'm here to say this sandwich and the chicken is swear out loud good! Nice words and describing this chicken do not belong together, and should not be tolerated!!\n\nThat's all I have to say. If you're not on your way to crispy, delicious, deep-fried chicken goodness by now, I don't know if there's anything else I can say that will save you\n\nIt's so F'in good!!", 4], ["My friends and i were here because we stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for some cornbread. Initially we went to Fresh because we wanted cornbread with soup, but figured maybe a meat place would have better cornbread than a vegetarian/vegan place?\n\nWhen we walked in we were the second group of customers here. This place doesn't seem to be that popular and it was rather quiet. My friend and I decided to order The County Fried Chicken - which was $23 (which is supposed to be a 1 person serving) for 5 pieces of chicken along with 2 tiny square pieces of cornbread. Another friend ordered the 8oz Aged Sirloin Steak.\n\nWhen our cornbread came it was cold ... yet the cornbread had grill marks on them? I'm confused. I was expecting it to be warm and fluffy but it was just cold. The fried chicken was phenomenal. I ate a piece of chicken breast and I could barely tell it was the breast part because you could tell that they definitely marinated their chicken to make it juicy. The sad part of it all was that the pieces of chicken were small. I wanted that taste in my mouth forever. But also $23 for that?! I could've ordered a whole korean fried chicken at The Fry or Mymy chicken around the same price for more.\n\nMy friend's 8oz steak didn't look 8oz. It literally looks like chopped up slices of beef from a chinese restaurant, and ensembled it with a lot of fries and flavourless/cold beef au jus. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back to this place unless someone offered to pay for those 5 pieces of chicken for $23", 2], ["Drinks: Bartender knows his drinks and the long bar makes it fun to be at the bar in a group.  Super casual and locals only-esque.  This is a great spot for a casual night out. \nFood: I think that if you want fried chicken, you have come to a good spot.  I ordered the chicken salad because, I'm one of those ppl who always order salad when I go out and this felt so average.  Chicken was there, lettuce was there, cheese was there but nothing was worth ordering again. \nBut this may not be the place for a salad, and that's ok!  Grab a Fresh salad next door and come here for the bevys after.", 4], ["Not sure why some of the reviews are a bit low. Food is amazing.

According to the people sitting next to our table, the Cesar's are to die for! Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try one but will definitely be returning. \n\nWe ordered the county burger and the fried chicken thigh sandwich. Both were very delicious and came with either a side of fries or a salad. I would highly recommend the salad as it wasn't your typical iceberg lettuce but a Boston lettuce base with sliced radish and cucumber and I believe a balsamic dressing. \n\nThe county burger was very juicy. If you enjoy eating horseradish, there's a very strong horseradish flavour in this dish. I could have used a little less of sauce in my burger but overall, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it. \n\nThe fried chicken thigh sandwich was also delicious. The chicken was very juicy and there was just the right amount of crisp on the outside. \n\nOverall, the county general is small, quaint and very clean.

Their once-famous \"Korean Fried Chicken\" is no longer here. Instead, it seems the remaining chefs have tried to recreate the previous chef's supposed masterpiece (can't say, never tried it but reviews/videos from his time look amazing), falling way short in terms of quality and taste. Yet, they somehow justify raising the price up to $44 for two portions which consists of sandy breading that is fused to somewhat moist dark meat and dry pieces of white meat. For the same price (even less if you go during their happy hour), you're better off going to Bar Fancy just down the street and getting truly the best fried chicken in town.\n\nSeems like they have other popular offerings here (brunch, jerk chicken). Maybe they should just take the fried chicken off the menu.", 1], ["Drank the best Gin & Tonics here. The bartender really takes pride in making his own tonic water and generally a drink nerd you need when you're looking to sip on the best. Atmosphere is cozy and the music isn't too loud.

Instead we were bait and switched with an \"Asian fusion\" menu that was 10% off, dishes from $12.99+. This was particularly upsetting. Needless to say the \"new lunch menu\" was mediocre and poor quality. I ordered the coconut green curry and when it arrived all I could taste was peppercorn. It should have just been called peppercorn sauce with some chicken. Having dined at County General many times this was the most disappointing dining experience there.

Panels of wood line the ceiling leading to an impressive wall of jenga-like blocks with the signature white coq serving as the focal point.  Mr. Pig makes an appearance alongside with \"Eat Me\" scribbled on the chalkboard he holds up.  Atop the bar shelves you'll find heads of various carnivores adorned with the likes of sunglasses.  I thought they were quite cute.\n\nThe rectangular restaurant does not allow for a whole lot of seating though the space seems more accommodating towards large groups than small ones.\n\nThe young staff here are all very easy-going and while I wouldn't call them inattentive, they work at their own pace.\n\nWe opted to start with the Trio of Steamed Pork Buns ($12) with green apple slaw, avocado chutney and kimchee served with a bottle of hot sauce for those wanting to add a little heat.  The steamed buns were spot on, elastic but soft and supple - I dare say even better than most Chinese restaurants make.  My favourite flavour was the green apple slaw, with the kimchee being a nay for me.  It just overpowered the flavour of the pork.\n\nThen came the infamous Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich ($14) which gets a lot of \"tender\" lovin' care, being done up sous-vide for an extra juicy bird.  However, where the texture wins, the flavour loses out.  This had to have been one of the blandest fried chicken sandwiches I've had and adding no salt to injury with the use of a rather mild-flavoured avocado does nothing to save the poor clucker.  We opted for a side of fries instead of salad which was served with a delicious house-made ketchup.  I think the Bibb lettuce would've had more crispiness to it.  Maybe I should've ordered the salad after all.\n\nIf you're a fan of variety then skip dessert because there is but one.  Tonight it was a Peanut Butter Trifle layered with cake, peanut brittle and chocolate mousse.  They should change their name to Pirate General as discovering the layers was like digging for treasure.  Perhaps serving it in a mason jar so that you could see all the layers would be a good compass to navigate my incomplete spoonfuls of dessert.  The texture of the mousse was a little off for me and the presentation could use some work.  Flavour-wise it was not bad.\n\nOur bill came to $45 including tax and tip.  My meal here was like a roller coaster.  It started on a high with the steamed pork bun trio, then a low with the chicken thigh sandwich, and then the ride was over with the mediocre dessert.\n\nAnd as you may or may not know, the restaurant is Carlo Catallo and Victor Barry's (Splendido) stab at casual dining.  If I were mom and dad, I'd say Splendido is the overachieving older child who never fails to please and the County General would be younger spoiled brat who doesn't give a sh!t about pleasing the parents.", 3], ["BOTTOM LINE: Get anything with chicken on it! Too bad their dishes can be a bit inconsistent.\n\nI quite like the County General, from its woody interior to its large window and to its minuscule patio - it gives it a homey, westerny feel. The service is generally pretty good, though can be a bit slow, so if you're in a rush, order quickly!\n\nThe menu is succinct and mostly pretty good, especially their chicken. You must order their FRIED CHICKEN THIGH SANDWICH or the FRIED CHICKEN FOR TWO - you won't be disappointed! The dinner for 2 gives you a wide assortment of garnishes and sauces, and lettuce to wrap that fried goodness in. I've had the COUNTY BURGER which is pretty solid and deceptively small (you will be full!). the BIG SALAD is exactly that, but kinda bland. Though primarily a meatarian's paradise, they do offer some veggie selection: My DC ordered the WHITE BEAN \"MEATBALL\" SANDWICH, which is crusted in panko. He quite liked it so at least you veggie friends won't starve here! \n\nMy one big complaint, though, is that while the quality of their dishes is mostly good, it can be inconsistent. On one occasion, they even \"ran out\" of the friend chicken sandwich...just as we rolled in for lunch at 12:02, and there weren't any other patrons. :S", 3], ["Great drink options & bartending. Only had the burger, mainly drinks. Great service, sat at bar. Def recommend this spot. Good walking area. Parked on side street.", 5], ["Decided to check this place out for brunch and was not disappointed!  Had the mushroom and leek omelet and shared the cheddar scones with sage butter and the chocolate chip pancake with banana and caramel sauce.  Now my omelet was good..I am not much of an egg person but every once in awhile I get a craving.  So I fulfilled it here.  But oh..my...god....the scones were delish!  Light and airy and oh so cheddar-y!  But the hit of the brunch for me was the pancake.  This is no ordinary chocolate chip pancake.  First of all I think the name is a bit misleading...there really isn't any chocolate chips..all the chocolate is inside the pancake, but it is done wonderfully so it is not that annoyingly sweet taste.  The bananas with the sauce just make it divine!  The scones and pancake are more like sides to a dish - not a main meal...however next time I might just order those dishes as my main. They were definitely better thanb my omelet.\n\nThis place does not take resos for brunch and they get packed.  If you are not there by 11am, well then aim for coming around 12:30pm.  Service was amazing - from the time I called to inquire about resos (the woman on the phone was so pleasant and asked me how my day was going!  Who does that?!).  Our server was really nice...my friend had to send something back b/c it looked a little under done and they were quite happy to re-do the order to the way she liked it.

Its a tiny restaurant located in a big city, serving farmer inspired dishes, with a rustic decor and plating and a fantastic menu.\nFor all brunch lovers out there, looking for a homey breakfast done right, using fresh ingredients, The County General is the place to be at. As the weather warms in this rather cold city, I long for those warm Sundays where the act of \"brunching\" becomes a fundamental part of one's weekend.\n\nI would describe brunch at The County General as tasty and comforting with a \"farmy\" feel to it. Their Croque Madame is certainly representative of that and a crowd pleaser with a decadent cheese melting conception.\nThe Croque Madame is simply a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a twist. The twist being the soft b\u00e9chamel sauce, the use of hand crafted specialty cheeses and the added element of a fresh sunny side-up egg.\nServed with your choice of french fries or salad, this sandwich is melted ooey-gooey goodness on a hard-wood cutting tray.\n\nAlthough sandwiches seem to be what drives the Toronto crowds to the County General, it seems their big hit, whether for brunch, lunch or dinner is still the infamous Fried Chicken Thigh Sandwich.\nThis sandwich has been praised and talked about all over the city, and its popularity does match its taste. I mean, who would have thought of taking tender pieces of chicken thighs (which in my mind are the best part of a chicken), soaking them in buttermilk, then frying them to perfection and assembling in a mix of avocado chutney, pickled red onions and coriander (aka cilantro), on a milk bun...truly mouth-watering.\nThe way to eat this sandwich is by squeezing the top bun down until the master piece is bite-able, and then sinking your teeth into what 's about to become a great brunching experience.\n\nLast but not least, I would like to give an honorary mention to County General's Eggs Benny.\nAlthough I can attest I have had better eggs benny experiences, such as the one from the already closed Hoof Cafe (thanks for ruining me for life btw); I would say CG's Eggs Benedict are quite good and worth the try. They tend to be more rustic and dry than your typical benny, but the hollandaise is quite fresh and tasty and the eggs are done just right. So if you are a Benedict fan, you would not go wrong with these.\n\nAs a parting thought, I would also like to give a mention to CG's coffee. I had one of the best cappuccinos there.

They have such an incredible selection of beers ones like yours that is sometimes difficult to choose. Although there is no beer on tap they have so many different types that you can choose from.

The only food they have is pizza by the place next door, called Yeah yeahs pizzas. I had a slice of \"the white\"and it was lukewarm and mediocre at best. There was no crisp to the crust and just tasted soggy and sad. Also it was $5.25  for a slice, basically $6 after tax + tip.

The peach blossom iced tea was very refreshing. Keep in mind that it takes around 5 minutes to brew. In terms of food, they only had a small tray of pastries to the side, so be sure not to come here on an empty stomach.\n\nThe seats downstairs were pretty much filled, so we headed upstairs. There's a skylight and plenty of natural lighting, which was great for working. However, the walls were covered with random paint splotches and hooks where paintings should've been.

We ordered a half pound each of the brisket and ribs with cole slaw and peach cobbler. The total was just over $50, certainly no bargain. You'd get double that for the same price in Texas, but is on par for Toronto bbq.\n\nWhen we opened the packages, the meat smelled like liquid smoke...and tasted like it at first bite, too. The overall flavour was delicious, but the quality of meats was questionable; the brisket was disgustingly fatty and the ribs were nearly vegetarian (meatless). There was no bbq sauce included for either meat. We loved the cole slaw and the cobbler was cinnamonny and delicious. \n\nIt's ok enough for Toronto, especially if you can't or don't have the time to cook your own.", 3], ["Probably the best smokehouse in the city run by extremely friendly people.

Terria made sure we all had what we needed. She even told the owner how much she enjoyed our group that the chef and owner gave us a free Ribeye to show their appreciation.\n\nI ordered a indecisive sampler. It was created for me. I promise. 3 baby back ribs that would fall off the bone to the touch. The brisket was tasty but the sauce wasn't  my favorite. The pulled pork was absolutely the best I've tasted. I ordered a slider bun to make it into a sandwich. The smoked sausage did not disappoint. The steak that was complementary was moist and tasty as well.\n\nIf you visit Toronto, you need to stop here.

Sure, Adamson may still the best, but Beach Hill is not that far off in terms of how good the meat tastes (the ribs/brisket were tasty, the sausage was great; though unlike Adamson, not sure if they would have been good taken out). It also has better sides (the standout was the beans, or more precisely, the sauce it was bathed in), is cheaper, much easier to get to via public transportation (near Main St subway station), the owners are friendlier and the service is quick while still being personable, and there's just a more relaxed atmosphere. \n\nI hope this place doesn't get eaten away by the different BBQ joints popping up in the city, because it's really good.

This was a lot of food for one person, if I added another small side, it would have been a good amount of food for two people with normal sized appetites.\n\nThe fatty beef brisket was really good. Juicy, tender meat with a nice char on the outside with the proper amount of seasoning.\n\nThe beef rib was also really good. A huge Flintstone sized beef rib with a nice layer of bark. The meat fell of the bone, really nicely seasoned with a nice smoke to it and a beautiful char to it.\n\nThe poblano coleslaw was a good coleslaw with a nice kick to it which came from the poblano peppers but nothing too spicy.\n\nTo finish off the meal I had the bourbon banana pudding. I really loved this dessert, I could have eaten two but one was good enough. Nice creamy banana pudding with small hints of bourbon.\n\nThe service was really friendly and lots of picnic benches inside for ample places to sit down and eat.\n\nBeach Hill Smokehouse is a really good place in Toronto to get Central Texas barbecue.

Looking through Yelp, a five star BBQ place grabbed our attention. Hello!\n\nBeach Hill Smokehouse is located in the Upper Beach area, not somewhere known for a lot of restaurants, muchless good food. Walking in, there were a few picnic tables for dining and what looks like a bar still under construction. Walking towardss the back of the restaurant, through a narrow passageway, revealed more picnic tables, an open kitchen and the counter where orders are placed and picked up.\n\nThere was a short line ahead of us, giving us time to look over the menu. Their meats are priced and sold by the half pound. They offer a few sandwiches, basic sides, and some desserts. The fellow ahead of us got a juicy looking beef rib so we had to have one too. It looked so good! We also ordered half a pound of pork ribs, half a chicken, a small potato salad, and a large coleslaw. Yes we were pigs. I don't know how much the beef rib weighed but the total bill was $66 with tax and tip.\n\nEverything was served on a tray, no plates, and only plastic utensils and lots of paper towels available. Rustic. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe beef rib was the most distinctive thing on the tray, looking like a lump of black coal with a bone going through it. BBQ lovers know that as the bark (think tree bark) and all the goodness is just below it. No disappointment here. The meat was so tender and juicy with a nice smokey flavour. A plastic fork or fingers were just fine to pull it apart. Excellent!\n\nThe pork ribs had just the right amount of resistance to come off the bone. Delicious! We should have ordered more.\n\nThe chicken, although good, paled in comparison to the beef and pork. If you like chicken, order it. I'll stick with the beef and pork ribs.\n\nTheir house BBQ sauce, neither sweet nor tangy, worked well with all the meats.\n\nThat beef rib must have been bigger than we thought. I ended up taking home some of the beef and a quarter chicken. That's what you get when you order with your eyes. It was just as good a couple of days later.\n\nWe learned a few things while waiting in line and ordering. This place has been open since January, 2018 and they're serving Central Texas style BBQ where it's mostly about the smoke. It's run by two Americans, one from Buffalo and the other from Texas, so I guess that makes it authentic.\n \nIt's been a few days since my friend returned to Vancouver and he's been texting me every day about this food. Yes, it was that good. Try it.", 5], ["Bow down all ye faithful for the god of fire is in the house. Hold up in praise these smoky blessings in both hands and sing your hymns of joy.

Maybe I don't know much about Texas BBQ, but I was disappointed in only getting two large pork bone with little meat. It tastes okay, but I can easily make the same dish at a much lower cost.

I doubt it because it is very expensive for the amount of food I got.", 3], ["So my friends and I were at woodbine beach over the weekend we were looking for a place for an early dinner. This BBQ place had great reviews so we decided to try it. FYI this restaurant only has street parking. Additionally, there are no servers here. This BBQ joint is more like a take out place. There are plenty of picnic tables inside the shop for you to sit down with sinks and plentiful bounty paper towels. They had quite the variety on their menu. We ordered brisket, ribs, and a side of mac and cheese. The portion sizes were pretty small considering the price. For the brisket we chose to eat the lean piece rather than the fatty one. Obviously the fatty one tasted better but it was neat that they even gave you an option for the health conscious folks out there. Anyways, overall, the place had good food but it wasn't the best BBQ I've ever had. The people behind the counter taking our orders were friendly. But the price was pretty expensive for what we ordered (portion wise). Side note, they had a great playlist going on - a lot of throwbacks.", 3], ["The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious.

Everything is in paper and styrofoam, even when staying in.\n\nThey have a specials menu that changes. \n\nTasty smokey comfort food. I highly recommend trying this place out.

The spicy sausage was excellent and possibly my favourite thing, the brisket was decent, but everything else fell a bit short.

The restaurant is clean, but sparsely decorated. \n\nI had a Lockheart sandwich with a side of devilled egg potato salad with a ginger ale.

Or something that needs an oil change.\nThis bit of brisket was perfect.  It was moist and with the right amount of fat on it.  Remember only a New Yorker will order lean brisket.  It's like ordering a vegetarian steak.\nThe best part was that it was only covered in dry rub.  You could taste the spices accenting the flavour of the meat supporting the taste of the smoke.\nIn my humble opinion Texas barbecue is the only true barbecue.

Usually my husband can polish off dinner for 4 to six on his own, we had so much food we took most home and he was full.  I loved the smoked turkey.  The pork ribs were moist, not too fatty and finished perfectly.  The spicy was right for me, but hubby would have liked more spice.  We tried the coleslaw, baked beans (were a little sweet but I couldn't stop eating them), mac and cheese and potato salad.  I would not hesitate to recommend any of it,  the BBQ sauce is in containers in the dinning room, I like it because I have the option of pouring on tones more, the food doesn't need it, but it's delicious.  Peach cobbler for dessert tasted like my Nana's.  So this was almost the best ever.  No skimping on the spice or sugar and worth every penny.  \nService was amazing, we came when we thought it wouldn't be too busy, but they had lots of take out orders and a few people in the dinning room.  I think the owner served us, he was very helpful with the menu, explaining the serving sizes, heat in the food, best sides to compliment our mains and how the place worked.  \nThe only draw back is the presentation, but who cares when it's tastes this good,  everything is served trays  with butchers paper or styrofoam containers.

It was enhanced by a liberal application of their barbecue sauce. (That sauce ultimately turned out to be the highlight of the meal.)\n\nAs for the sandwich, it was...okay. The meat was relatively tender, but unfortunately that's where the positives end. There wasn't a hint of smokiness contained within, and, worse yet, the meat was disappointingly dry.

I especially loved the bruschetta, mushroom pasta, and beef tartare.\n\nFor mains we ordered the veal, mushroom truffle linguine, shrimp shelled pasta with pistachios, Caesar salad - all wonderful.\n\nThe service was friendly and excellent despite being a busy night. The only disappointment was the chefs platter of dessert. The panna cotta was grainy and had a near-frozen texture, the cream inside the cannolis tasted like ricotta cheese and was too savoury - only the donuts were good. A shame to end such a fantastic meal on a low note.\n\nNonetheless highly recommended and can't wait to return!", 5], ["I had my eye on this place for a while just because of its stunning accent wall. I'm so glad my dining experience was similarly stellar.\n\nMe and two girlfriends made a reservation for 6:30pm on a Friday. The restaurant was certainly full, and we were seated near the back in this cozy corner.\n\nSince there was a little more time for happy hour, we decided to share the beef tartare and bruschetta. LOVED both of our appetizers. Seriously could've had a meal just with these two dishes. \n\nFor our individual orders, I opted for the piemonte pizza, while my friends both got the Cavatelli e Cime di Rapa. My pizza was good - I love a good white-sauce mushroom pizza. However, the pasta was on another level. The waiter warned us that it was a more bitter pasta - not everyone's cup of tea. When we tasted it, we thought it was absolutely delicious, though it did remind us of some more asian vegetable flavours. \n\nPortions were great for the price (probably not quite $$$ level), and our waiter was attentive throughout the night. Looking forward to coming back!", 5], ["Great decor.\nGreat service.\n\nI ordered the lunch 3-course for $20.  It was a good deal. i had salad, fish, and  a dessert - \"biscotti\".\n\nFish was good.  The veggie and the fish balanced very well.  The fish skin was crispy.\n\nnow i put biscotti with double quote because i asked for biscotti.  the server came with announcing biscotti and it was more like a maracoon, not a biscotti.  There is a delicious italian bakery shop just down the block to justify that.  Anyway, the dessert came with only like 1 piece. like... I wish it would have come in 2.  Who serves a dessert like that?\n\nI have been here in the past. Their food taste great.  The quality has been consistent.  Yet their menu never excite me to come. I would rather to go elsewhere.", 3], ["My favourite part of Oretta is their backroom cafe tucked away around the corner and far from the craziness of King Street West. With a busy Starbucks next door where its hard to find proper seating most of the time, Oretta Cafe has become my favourite spot to do casual business meetings or meet with friends over a coffee and brunch. \n\nI've been to the restaurant proper multiple times for dinner and I highly recommend their La Palma Pizza which is the perfect size for one really hungry person or a good sharing dish for small groups. \n\nIf you are in for a light meal, I recommend trying the Tagliere Misto plate with two cheeses, meats and olive and jam which is perfectly complemented with some good Italian red wine (ask the server for their recommendation). \n\nI would highly recommend Oretta for special occasions and celebratory dinners.", 5], ["This is my second time coming here, and this occasion was for brunch. They've got a great deal for bottomless mimosas, which I think is totally worth it. The decor is super modern chic, and has a great space upstairs for private events. I ordered the ravioli, and to be honest, pretty underwhelming. It was a good portion though. I tried some of my friend's pizza, and that was delicious. The deal included a donut, and it was ok, but the donut was a bit hard, so not too happy about that. The service I will say was great, and I love their uniforms! I would still go back, but definitely try for something else. 3.5 stars", 3], ["2.5 stars. I came here with a girlfriend for happy hour. Had no issues with the service but can we talk about the food? We had the polenta fries which had literally 5 pieces. I was genuinely expecting more. We also had the Margherita pizza which is honestly like half of a personal pizza and it's thin crust.\n\nWhile the place itself is very pretty, the tables are so close together. Your bum can't help grazing another table trying to get into your seat and it felt like we were having conversations with the tables beside us as the music got louder and how close we were in proximity.", 2], ["It almost feels like the interior of this restaurant was more memorable than the food for me.

There was a baby shower when I was there; seems like the perfect venue for it!\n\nThe service was just pleasant, nothing too special as it seemed like they were in a rush. I had the house made linguini, which was a little different than what I was used to. It was too bland for my taste, as I prefer more creamy and rich flavours. The best part was the passionfruit tart ; was fresh and loved the mango/pineapple. Overall, I'm glad I visited here but may not be in a rush to return as it wasn't particularly outstanding other than the decor.", 3], ["Went on a Thursday for Happy Hour, decent priced small plates & drink options. Great atmosphere! Such a pretty venue, equipped with a DJ and attentive staff.\n\nThe menu options were pretty good, and the $5 glasses of Prosecco made them better!

This is a nice restaurant to celebrate a special occasion, and there were at least four parties celebrating a birthdays the evening I went. \n\nThe decor and ambience makes it a nice place to order an elegant drink or bring a date. The cocktails served were quite nice. However the food can be a bit mixed. It's Italian fare and our table ordered three pastas, a pizza and an eggplant main. The pizza and pastas we're good although not wow. The best of which was the ravioli. What stood out to me was the eggplant. It was almost like a fried eggplant lasagne, layered with eggplant, cheese and tomato sauce and it was the clear favorite of the evening - I would come back to order this! \n\nThey served us table for the bread and our service was impeccable. Our server was very attentive and came to check on us frequently. We brought a birthday cake and they served and slices it for a small fee.", 4], ["My boyfriend took me all around downtown for a food adventure for my birthday and this was our first stop.

There is tons of marble, dim lighting, and all the makings of an upscale spot. \n\nThe service is amazing! Our waitress was very attentive, made sure to get our birthday girl her dessert of choice with a candle, and constantly came by to refill our water and check on us. \n\nI had the burrata pizza (gluten free), and added prosciutto to it. The quality was amazing and I couldn't even tell that it was gluten free. It was slightly oily but otherwise delicious.", 4], ["This restaurant is so Instagram-able! While I've known of the place for a while, I decided to take my significant other to this place after consulting a list of the \"best instagram restaurants in Toronto.\" The staff were definitely above average - very nice, attentive.

We had the FOCACCIA PORCHETTA and GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA. \n\nI have to say, pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes -- lucky me, because I was starving! I really enjoyed both meals. The only thing was that they had a little too much \"Rosemary\"? Was that what I was tasting? It was a bit overwhelming for me. I understand why the focaccia had rosemary -- although I would have preferred a bit more garlic. But why in the gnocchi alla romana? Anyway, I was starving, so I overlooked it. But next time, whatever I order, I'll ask that they take it easy on the rosemary -- or, just skip it all together! Maybe I'm allergic to rosemary!

They did a great job setting up the ambiance. \n\nWine is good. \n\nI've been 3 times so far and food has been quite mediocre overall. I've kept coming back to give it another try because I love the ambiance. Also they were new when I first tried. They're not new anymore. \n\nBrunch was nice. Dinner was only ok. Lunch definitely was disappointing though. The kale salad was so boring. Very light dressing, barely any flavour other than the toasted pumpkin seeds. The main course was disappointing. I got the branzino. It came with zucchini. The fish was not fresh, you could smell it. The all zucchini sides felt like leftovers. The dessert was cannoli. That was my first time trying cannoli, and if that's what it is, I never want another one in my life. How could it be so bland, it's deep fried with cheese? I know people who love cannoli, it can't be that that they love. \n\nCaprese was ok. It had some interesting tomatoes. The cheese on it was average. The margarita pizza was ok. They do thin crust. Seemed pretty standard as far as Italian pizza goes, so if you order that you will be less disappointed. \n\nMy guess is they skimp on the quality of the ingredients to increase their margins. Blandest cheese ever, fish was bad. \n\nThey had a $20 3-course menu for lunch and I still felt like it wasn't good value due to the low quality food. It didn't help that service was extremely slow. The restaurant was mostly empty, no reason for the service to be that slow. \n\nCan't say I'd come back on my lunch break considering the poor quality food and slow service.

It really is beautiful in there. The pink and gold risks looking like 1980s Miami, but Oretta somehow pulls it off.\n\nIt seems like other Yelpers have had mixed feelings about this place. I went for a celebratory dinner date and quite enjoyed it. Service was friendly, and our meals were delicious. We had the polenta, beet salad, and pizzas. It certainly wasn't my favourite pizza in the city, but it was quite good. You definitely also seem to pay for the flashy-ness, as well, but I am not surprised given the location.

The restaurant was fully booked for the evening and the only reservations available were for 5 and 6pm, however they will accept walk-ins on a first-come-first-served basis and there are no reservations at the bar. I was there at for my 6pm reservation and there were only a couple other people there and the dining room didn't start to fill up until almost 8pm.\nThe bistro-styled vaulted 2-storey space has a really nice feel with plenty of art deco touches and an impressive bar are dominating the center of the dining room. It feels comfortable, modern and not at all stuffy. I especially like that it is not a loud restaurant and you could comfortably have a conversation with others at your table without yelling, unlike many restaurants out there.\n\nI started with the Bison tartare which was nicely prepared and seasoned. The breaded soft boiled quail egg made for a nice creamy sauce for the tartare. For my main I had the Gnocchi with squash and healthy shavings of truffles which was really comforting and satisfying dish. I ended my meal with very nice zeppoli (a Italian doughnut), which was more crunchy and flaky than a typical zeppoli and filled with a light and a mildly-sweet chestnut cream filling. It's a nice dessert if you are not into sweets.\n\nMy meal was very reasonably priced, especially for King West (and considering Buca is across the street), and everything about it was great which is very impressive for a newly opened restaurant. I will definitely be back again!", 4], ["Orietta has been hiding something: it's gorgeous little cafe tucked away in the alley beside the main restaurant. With heaps of takeaway goodies like Italian baking, focaccia & panini sandwiches, spinach crostata, bomboloni and  pizza, they look poised to give Forno a run for their money. The coffee can be a tad bitter for my tastes and they don't offer cream, but they do serve almond milk and cold pressed juices. The real highlight here is the stunning space and the staff, who are exceptional. There's even a gorgeous event space upstairs you can rent out, and that they'll soon have open to patrons who need a quieter spot to work during the day. I'm sure the patio will be great in summer, too. A brilliant addition to the neighbourhood!", 5], ["Came here with a group of friends for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.

My friends had the striploin with eggs which were pretty good.as well as the chicken breast and rapini. We ordered from the brunch menu so can't comment on other items. Overall a great place to hang out with friends, take pretty pictures, , eat some good food and experience friendly but slowwww service.", 3], ["Horrible experience. I went here for the summerlicious 3 course meal. I had read about the beautiful interior design of this place and it was indeed good, but not good enough to make up for the bland and dry chicken, tasteless pasta and mediocre at best dessert.

The squid ink itself has no flavour, but rather, it gives the pasta a unique black colour. The bay scallops and shrimp were very well seasoned; coupled with the buttery pasta sauce and tomatoes, which freshened up the dish, the thick pasta was a delight to eat! \n\nDESSERT: Chocolate brownie with ice cream and tart crumbs (I cannot find the name of the actual dish online nor do I remember it from last night, but this was essentially the crux of the dessert)\n\nThe brownie was very dense and creamy, perhaps too creamy for my liking, as it felt very heavy. Nevertheless, the blood orange sauce on top of the brownie was refreshing and delicious. The pistachio-like flavoured ice cream also had quite a unique and light taste, which complemented the almond/tart crust and dense brownie.", 3], ["My boyfriend and I went to Oretta for lunch last Sat.

We were a group of 8, spent a lot of money and felt at least the birthday person should have had a complimentary dessert.  Food was pretty good , pizza was a bit wet in the centre though.

The host was really friendly and suggested we try a pistachio biscotti along with our orders, which was great. \n\nSuper colourful and really quick service.

Cavoletti salad I enjoyed.  Nice dressing and serving size. Carciofi Tartufo, fried artichokes, too fried and didn't enjoy. \nHad the branzino as a main, substituted the pasta for the shaved artichoke.  The meal was well flavoured, although I asked for lemon as there wasn't any sauce.   The Florentina for $120 was over cooked and a bit chewy.  My friends actually sent it back.

There are so many better restaurants in this beautiful city of ours, don't waste your time on this one. \n\nMy three girlfriends and I had a reservation for 7 pm. The hostess was super friendly (and had great eyebrows!) and led us to a cute pink booth beside the bar. \n\nWe ordered a few drinks and appetizers to start the night off. We were laughing and having a great time, enjoying the food and drinks, when suddenly, the large, metal wall sconce above our heads falls out of its socket! We all jumped in fright! Thankfully, the sconce's power chord prevented the light from crashing into our heads, but needless to say, it was quite dangerous. \n\nThe staff apologized, the manager came by and apologized, and then quickly moved us to another table. They helpfully transferred our plates and drinks, albeit accidentally throwing out my friend's drink in the process. She then proceeds to order another one to replace it, and not one, not two, but three different people come by to clarify her one drink order to replace what another staff member inadvertently tossed out. Her drink arrived almost 30 minutes later; did they carve the ice by hand? What took so long? The restaurant was nearly empty.\n\nRegardless, we were fine, we were alive, no one was electrocuted, and so we laughed it off and continued our dinner. The manager even offered to get us a bottle of prosecco to apologize for having his resto's light fixture almost crack our skulls. \n\nNext issue: I ordered a second drink. The Rosso di Sera sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. It arrived, looked beautiful, and I went to take a sip, when I noticed a dead fruit fly floating in my drink! Ugh. Flagged down a staff member, told them about the fly, and they removed the drink while offering their apologies and simultaneously offered to get me another drink. I declined.\n\nThe rest of the evening progressed smoothly. We wanted to have a good night and genuinely enjoyed the food. The service, on the other hand, was deplorable. As we finished our meal, we were waiting for our server to come by and clear our plates, and offer us dessert and coffee. Standard resto procedure, right? Not for Oretta, apparently. \n\nWe sat around for a good 30 minutes, waiting for someone to come by. Our server did pass by our table a few times, but she didn't catch the arms we were waving in the air, nor the attempts to catch her eye, nor the polite \"excuse me\"s. This happened a few times. Mind you, she may have been busy or in the back on her break, fine. I get it. I worked in the restaurant industry all throughout university, so I understand that servers take a break when things are slow. But that doesn't mean you leave your tables unattended! What makes it worse is that the \"manager\" was just hanging out at the bar having dinner himself. You'd think the restaurant manager would notice a table of four looking around for their server, especially given the light fixture incident, but no, he didn't. \n\nWe order espressos and desserts to share. Drinks arrive, great. Two desserts arrive but we are waiting on the third. Assuming it will arrive shortly, the four of us proceed to enjoy our coffees and the desserts. About 15 minutes go by, and the affogato hasn't yet arrived. We try to flag down our server once more, and ONCE MORE, she is no where to be found. We get the attention of another staff member and inquire about the missing dessert. Another 20-30 minutes pass, and our server re-appears with the dessert in hand, and mumbled apology about the delay. The affogato was not what my friend had expected, but at this point, our collective patience had worn thin. We asked for the bill, paid, and left.", 1], ["I've now been here a handful of times, every time satisfied with the volume and flavours I'm getting from this small sushi shop!

Every time we've gone with some combo and been pleasantly surprised by the volume. Not to say we over-order, but that it always seems to be enough despite us being concerned putting our order in! The rolls are consistent and you can tell there's care put into making them, and they have consistently been meeting expectations.\n\nCompared to other nearby shops I'd say their portions may seem a bit smaller, but there does feel to be more variety offered even in a combo price setup - it's not just variations of a California roll, accompanied by your basic tuna or salmon.

The amaebi sweet shrimp was very yummy with tons of flavour. The ikura was great. I wanted to order uni but they ran out. The maguro and otoro tuna was average. The medai was nice and flavourful. The surf clams were average. We also ordered the JapanGo roll which was great! It packed a ton of flavour and great textures! \n\nOverall, this is a good place to go if you want good quality sushi at a reasonable price.

She finished the majority of the eel and just left a little of the rice. \n3. Salmon Teriyaki: I was really disappointed by the salmon teriyaki. The teriyaki sauce was way too salty. I couldn't even mix it in with the rice to balance out the flavoring as the rice was drenched in the sauce as well. The quality of the salmon seemed okay but I could NOT bring myself to finish the dish as I was already gulping down glasses of water.\n\nThe service was very attentive - I understand now the other reviews of having the waitresses 'reach over' them to grab the plates. They are trying to clear your table of plates as soon as it's empty so make life easier on yourself and them and just place your finished plates to the sides of the table.\n\nOverall, this was a mediocre experience as the service and food was only okay.", 3], ["I would give this a solid 4.5 stars. \n\nThe good: I am wowed! Wow sushi surprised me! I ordered the small boat to share amongst 3 people and it was delicious. I thought the quality of the fish was fresh, and the unique sushi that they served also kept up with my palette. The portion size for a small boat also kept 3 girls' bellies well fed. \n\nThe bad: If you're looking at value, it's not something you can eat at everyday (well for some people you can). I think the total came to $60 something for everyone which is on the higher end for a la carte but not that bad. \n\nOverall, the good outweighs the bad big time. \nHighly recommend!", 4], ["Do not go to this place if you're looking to stay and socialize, or have a laid back dinner. They will rush you to order, rush you to eat, and rush you to pay and leave. I was taking my time drinking my miso soup while my friend and I was waiting for our 3rd guest to arrive. I had to explicitly say 2x that I wasn't done with my soup, and the server still proceeded to try and clear the plate. \n\nThen, at the end of the dinner, my friend and I ordered green tea, and the server was trying to push us to pay and leave bc they had a group waiting. There was an empty 4top next to us, and there wasn't a group waiting outside to sit.

I came back again recently and I wasn't impressed with the food. \n\nMy group ordered sashimi and several rolls to share. The rolls were quite small and the sashimi slices were thin. I was expecting the fish to be high quality if the portions were small, but the quality was just okay. Everything tasted mediocre.\n\nService wasn't very attentive either. The restaurant is small so the servers can actually see all the tables, but the servers were not around often to replenish our water. \n\nThis restaurant isn't offering value, as the portions are tiny.

Sushi lunch for 13, discount if paying with cash. Wonderful!", 5], ["One of my favourite sushi places in Toronto! \n\nCame here for dinner with a friend. We were given complimentary miso soup before we even ordered, which was great since it was freezing outside. It's such a simple soup but it was surprisingly really good.. a lot more flavourful than the generic miso soups you get from Japanese restaurants. \n\nI then ordered the Maki Dinner (spicy salmon roll, tempura roll and alaska roll). The sauce on the spicy salmon didn't look like the traditional spicy mayo sauce that you'd normally expect (it was yellow). It was quite spicy but it didn't overpower the roll itself. You could taste the quality of sashimi. \n\nThe tempura roll, which may seem pretty basic, was also surprisingly good. The tempura was crispy even inside the roll and all the flavours came together really harmoniously. \n\nThe alaska roll was the fanciest roll of the three (california roll with salmon on top) and had various sauces.  Something I also want to comment on is the temperature of these rolls. Some sushi restaurants serve rolls so cold, but these were served around room temperature, which just made things taste more flavourful - almost savoury. \n\nWe also ordered sake called \"Okunomatsu Kinmon\" (the first sake on the list). Although it was a little expensive at $22, this was the BEST sake I've ever had. It went down so smooth, did not feel overly acidic or overpoweringly alcoholic at all, and complimented the sushi really well. \n\nReally recommend this restaurant and can't wait to explore their lunch options!", 5], ["Now, I hate giving 1-2 stars for my old favourite sushi joint but in the last 1 year, I have given this place numerous tries to redeem itself...

But time and time again, the salmon avocado rolls were stale, the UNI was gross and STANK. Of course fish smelly fishy, but this smelled rotten. I think I paid nearly $50 for 4 rolls and 2 uni sushi pieces. You read that right, and it was take out too and I left a decent tip. WOW Sushi, WOW you've fooled me enough times.

The second favourite dish is the chirashi during lunch hours. \n\nTheir quality of sashimi is good. Their quality of sushi is good too. they do make a small portion of rice with a big fish slice on top. That's what I really like to eat. \n\nOther sushi restaurants would make a messy big rice with a small fish slice. I always pick fish off the rice. \n\nTheir quality of fish is smaller now because, you have to understand that there are million sushi joints and seafoods costs more. You also have to understand about the environment. If you complain about their small fish slices, then go somewhere else that serves big fish slices that does not taste authethic and natural. \n\nThey are always busy! I love their vibe.

HOwever WOW is amazingly clean, and small (approx. 8-10 tables) Our server was very efficient as were the sushi chefs.  Overall layout of this place is open concept with the sushi bar in the center, fixtures are Japanese themed, and generally I felt pretty cozy. \n\nTheir menu, and choices are perfectly selected, and if you're looking for meat, they only carry chicken, as I skimmed through their menu. \nWe ordered their Japango Roll, Spicy Sushi, Philadelphia, Salmon Avocado sushi and vegetable tempura...... Out of all the Japango was by far their specialty and it was totally delish with the lightly torched salmon to top off the dish! Presentation was superb, and taste factor was present! \n\nMy only recommendation is to make reservations due to the size of the restaurant, as well to add a few more meat items...kobe beef??", 4], ["Ordered Tempura udon and sushi dinner.

Even before ordering out food, tea, salad and miso soup was served right away. The server also offered complimentary black sesame ice cream when I asked what type of ice cream they had at the end of our main dish.\n\nAMBIENCE: The restaurant had a very cozy and warm feeling with several small tables and there was a nice jazzy type music playing in the background.\n\nFOOD: The food was what took me away as being a sushi conaisseur, I was blown away by the presentation and quality of the sushi and sashimi. We ordered the Global Leslie roll as was recommended by a friend and it was absolutely delicious and a type of roll never before had. It consisted of spicy tuna, red snapper and cucumber roll topped with unagi and avocado. It was fresh and tasty. Secondly, we ordered the sashimi dinner as the main entree to share and it was so beautifully presented, the fish size was somewhat small but it was fresh and cut perfectly. The platter also came with one piece of raw oyster which was also very tasty!\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with Wow Sushi and it was worth paying the extra dollar or two.", 5], ["Food was worth the price.

We were all very impressed.  My coworker from Vancouver had some bites into the sushi (which I think was butter fish) and he literally said \"oh wow\".  I felt the same way.\n\nDetails:\n\nFood: Sushi lunch is reasonable price - I think $12-$13, had about 8 pcs of spicy maki and really fresh sushi.  Everything melted in your month.  The spicy maki had a nice kick to it and much better than any spicy salmon roll I've had.  Also, the Spider Roll actually had soft shell crab in it and had a great crunch to it (I am so sick of AYCE restaurants calling things Spider Rolls with absolutely no soft shell crab or very minimal).  In addition, the miso soup actually had great taste without being overly salty.  \n\n5/5\n\nService: Fairly good, but I'm glad they took the time to serve our entire table at the same time.  Some Asian resto's do serve entrees to patrons at different times (not sure why though), so I have to give them credit for being served fast in such a busy place. 4.5/5\n\nVerdict: Probably best sushi I've had in GTA, better than Mi-NE.

The miso soup was decent, the salad was okay though wasn't a huge fan of the sauce.\n\nI ordered the sushi lunch. Normally I prefer sashimi over sushi, but I was on a slightly tight budget and would rather pay $12 over $15 in this case. I was impressed with the quality of the sushi; one of the reasons why I go sashimi over sushi is the rice quantity, but the proportion here is perfect, as well as the fact the rice actually tasted fresh! The chef also chose some unique kinds of fish in addition to the salmon and tuna fish, and they all tasted very good! I never found out what they actually were in the end. The spicy salmon roll that came with it was probably the disappointment of the meal, as it fell apart quite easily after I picked it up.

Some might complain about the price, but when you realize that it's factoring in the band, it's a good deal (just imagine $5-$10 off the bill total going to your cover).\n\nOh... your phone won't always work here, but I like it that way. Put the thing down, and talk to the people around you or focus on the killer band.", 5], ["Came here for their Saturday morning Bluegrass brunch special and was pleasantly surprised. All you can eat breakfast with a live bluegrass band playing was fun. The food was nothing original, your basic breakfast fare but it made it up in droves with the atmosphere.", 4], ["I had heard a lot about the bluegrass brunch. On Sunday I finally went! \n\nThe atmosphere and the live music are great. Our waitress was very nice too. But... I found the brunch plate overpriced. You get a simple plate of scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, pancakes, fruit, tea or coffee for around 20 dollars. I would have hoped to get some beans and veggies (not very expensive things) too for that price but they cost extra.\n\nFor three people a bill of 60 dollars seems a bit too much in my opinion. I wouldn't go again, sorry.", 3], ["This is such a cute place to have brunch or to watch a concert. It's really comfy and quaint.", 4], ["I had one of the BEST brunch experiences of my life here awhile back. We were wandering the Dundas-Ossington hood slightly hungover, trying to figure out where to plant ourselves for brunch this time. This was a longggg while back, before The Federal and The Guild had opened, when Dundas Street was horribly underserved in the brunch department.\n\nWe stumbled into the Dakota and came upon... BLUEGRASS BRUNCH. It. Was. Awesome.\n\nWe walked in, and it felt like I was on a farm and my fictional farm mother had just rung the farm brunch bell. We were seated at our picnic table and they promptly brought out large plates with piles of eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, sausages. You know, all that good brunch stuff. Whenever we ran out, they brought over another piping hot plate of what we'd run out of. Plus, there was a live bluegrass show (hence the name, \"Bluegrass Brunch\").\n\nThe food wasn't good, but I had such a GREAT time. It's not a place to take your foodie friends, but it's a place to take your fun friends. If those two groups overlap, then hopefully they can forgive the less than stellar food for the super awesome atmosphere.", 4], ["My review is based on the atmosphere, the bartenders and music (bands) and not their much talked about bluegrass brunch (which I haven't gone to cause I like my brunch one on one and not at a communal table). \n\nThese guys chose their bands well so even if you've not heard of that given night's act, you're sure to enjoy it. It's not been too difficult to get me off the bar stool and bust a move! Now I'm not so much for hard drinks or fancy ones, more a beer guy, but the the bar is run well. \n\nSo bring your favorite company and go! Pay the $5 or $10 cover (band), cause you'll dig the vibe. Is there still no phone reception there? Oh yes, The Dakota is lower level, or basement if you will.", 5], ["I've always been curious about the Dakota because there's always a line out the door on weekends.  We decided to check it out on a Thursday night to see a friends' band.  \n\nFront door staff were nice even thought there was a slight mix up with the guest list.  The space itself is in the basement, long and narrow.  The stage is small but intimate.  \n\nThe kitchen was still open but we had already eaten.  Would love to come back and check out the Bluegrass Brunch.", 4], ["One of my favourite places hands down. \n\nNot only have I enjoyed many fun-filled evenings with friends downing a 50 but this joint is also reminiscent of my parents' basement circa 1978. \n\nOnce you walk downstairs the feeling you experience is a very welcoming one. On a certain night when a band plays, it can get pretty busy but on regular nights, you can find a place to sit at the bar or at one of the tables. And if it's packed, who cares. It's easy to randomly meet people and strike up a conversation while sipping Labatt 50 and Wild Turkey. \n\nSince its opening, I've seen many great local and national bands perform, and as a live music photographer, I'm a fan of the Christmas lights used for lighting the stage, providing a nice ambient glow.  \n\nTheir Sunday brunches are very popular so do come early. If you're in the mood to get to know your neighbours, try to find a spot at the large communal table. You'll enjoy no-nonsense homestyle cooking while listening to the bluegrass band offered as entertainment.", 5], ["For someone who is totally not into country music (even the hipster variety that borderlines rock) I've had a great time in the handful of appearances I've made at the Dakota. I like the fact that there seems to be zero attitude in this place --from the bouncers to the bartenders.\n\nThe vibe is pretty electric most times. People are there to have a good time and consume mass amounts of alcohol. And I have to admit that even though I am not really into the music, the bands they have play here are pretty incredible. With the basement location and low ceilings the music rings off the walls and, quite literally, rocks.\n\nLast time I came here was on a Sunday and I was shocked that the place was rammed. There's not many Sunday locations you can say that about. Someone told me the house band always packs them in, and I can see why. They were indeed quite good. Again, this coming from a guy who listens to hip-hop all the time.", 4], ["This is THE music venue of the city. It's such a great ambiance, and the bands are great that are booked here. Some of the best nights to go are Sundays and Tuesdays are regulars, from the Beauties on Sunday to this month having Jason Collett doing a Tuesday night thing. \nI've only had a bit of food here, but when I have had it it was good. \nBut the beer pours well. They have a good selection of local and imported beer, and the staff is always friendly. \nOne of time things to do here is to go on Sunday for the bluegrass brunch. Good food, great music and a great family atmosphere.", 5], ["Dakota Tavern is a charming but small live music venue that serves food.  I went there for their Bluegrass Brunch.  The group performing was very entertaining.  The staff is friendly  and accommodating. The brunch, however, favored quantity over quality.  Admittedly, at $14.00 for all you can eat fruit, scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries and pancakes, perhaps your expectations shouldn't be too high. Nevertheless, without increasing their per serving costs, execution could have been better. Since everything but the fruit is served on a platter at once, it may not be surprising that some of the items arrived less than piping hot. The pancakes (on this day, blueberry) were cool and tough (batter over-beaten in the kitchen?). The sausage was unappetizing and the scrambled eggs (with diced red pepper) were not especially appealing.  The best part of the meal was the home fries.  Bottom line: enjoy the environment and the music, but go with low expectations for the food.", 3], ["I love this place.  Music every night, great staff and decor.  But you should like country music if you go cause it is very country.  I like how they will have a band play 2-3 sets in a night instead of the standard 3 bands doing 45 minute sets that has become the norm.  This is also a great people watching place, watching people dance to country music is always good times.  The food is good too, I have had a shrimp salad and the mac and cheese and I hear their weekend brunch is really fun.", 4], ["I wandered in here one weeknight on my own for a bite to eat, and thumbs up. I sat at the long bar, had a few beers and devoured a grilled cheese sandwich with a side of beans that was a step above. The place really filled up for the band, which I didn't get to hear much of because I was tired and had already downed a few beers. But I definitely want to go back.", 4], ["I love this bar. Great atmos with barn board and retro country parafanalia: lots of personality! Great bands from real bluegrass to rock'n country but none of that new country crap. Best pulled pork in the city. I have seen all ages there from moms and kids at bluegrass brunch, to older couples at mariachi mondays, to really happy yound revellers to hear weekend bands putting out. Really neat looking stage, great soundman, and cute and efficient staff. Bust a move under the spinning mirror ball. Just please, no line dancing-- this place is part of the Ossington happening stretch just above Dundas.", 5], ["Headed here on a date night, after Khao San Road(which was, as expected, good but nothing special). The cover was $10. The place was completely packed, and had an electric atmosphere. The country music bands that played were amazing, and had the crowd groovin to their tunes. Pretty sure my date and I were the youngest ones here, and we were the only 20-somethings but we had a fantastic time, regardless. Definitely a spot you want to hit up regularly if you want to have a good time. The only downside is that the music is so loud that it makes conversation difficult. The place has a fantastic vibe.", 5], ["It won't suprise any of you to find out that I have been to the southern united states of america.  I don't go often, after the unplesantness in 1775, I simply don't feel welcome, but I do enjoy a spot of southern music from time to time.  My experiences are often just fine at the Dakota Tavern, located under a portugese sports bar; but this time the nerve of the young wench at the bar!  Ignoring Horace W. Mayweather is inexcusable!  Not only did she ignore me, but also my lady companion, went to the other end of the bar to serve others, and passed over us again to put away glasses.  I know they aren't as busy since the musical combo 'the beauties' don't play anymore, but therefore the service should be faster!  Rude Service is the first and last straw for a man such as myself.

Than perhaps the Dakota Tavern is the joint for you.  I attended the all you can eat style family brunch this past Sunday and it was a really fun experience.  The tavern is exactly that....a tavern. Located on the lower level on Ossington, the Dakota pays homage to classic country bar establishments.  The place is quant, kitsch and fun.  Live blue grass music serenades you as you sit and enjoy home style cooking.  The brunch itself it a large platter of scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, pancakes and fruit salad.  The flavours are fairly basic and not complex at all.  The orange juice reminds me of the frozen sh#t you get out of a can.  The coffee was sub par.  However, the music and the atmosphere were lively and energetic.

I had dinner plans at 7pm so I didn't want to order anything too crazy and fill myself up but I was on Yelp and discovered this fries spot.\n\nI ordered the traditional poutine ($6 CA) and let me just tell you, this was SO BOMB. Honestly it doesn't exactly look too appealing once I opened up the to go box, so the pictures I took in the dark night did not come out that well. HOWEVER, the way the cheese was melted on the fries, along with the gravy that was poured right over the cheese ... it was absolute Heaven. The portion was pretty generous for the amount that I paid for. \n\nI ended up having some leftovers for the following morning. Sadly, it did not taste the same when I microwaved it.

This is a walk up site, with various other kinds of food stations around in conex boxes.  I got the Parisian Poutine: with crispy onions, roasted chicken and slabs of brie on top.

Great spot.", 5], ["Tried an order of the traditional poutine......I realised I'm not a fan. The cheese curds were off-putting, they were still cold and hard (even after letting the poutine sit to cool) and this did not contrast well with the heat from the gravy and fries. I think this is mostly due to me being conditioned to how my country eats our version of this, 'chips and gravy' (where my Aussies at? :D).\n\nThe stall has a dozen variations, some including meat and others tailored to vegetarians. Pricing isn't bad with $10 being the most you'll pay. Portion sizing is on the smaller side (compared to American standards), although personally for me, it was more than enough. The gravy was delicious, perhaps the star of the dish. The fries were slightly overdone but not a major issue, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed the dish had it been without the cheese curds.  \n\nWorth a visit if you've never had poutine.

The only downside of this place is that it's sort of like a food stand so its grab and go with surrounding picnic tables.

For lunch, my friend and I decided to order from them on foodora. We opted for the smoked meat and also the ground beef with crispy onion poutine. They were quick in making and delivering the product to the point that the cheese curd were not fully melted yet! (my favourite) In my order, a heaping amount of smoked meat was given with lots of cheesecurd. Cheesecurds were super squeaky and the fries were fresh and not soggy! The gravy was not overly salty and the flavour fit very well all together. My friend who ordered the ground beef one was sad that no crispy onion was provided!!! but she also agreed that the cheese was delicious and the fries were flavourful and good.

Probably one of the best, if not the best, loyalty card I've ever seen.\nServing both sweet and savoury crepes, and about 8 exquisite poutine flavours, I opted for the Parisienne poutine ; crispy onions,homemade gravy, fries cooked freah right before your eyes, cheese curds,  seasoned chicken breast (which was so so moist and flavourful),  and the piece de resistance,  slices of Brie cheese :') \n\nThe way the Brie stretched and pulled and oozed and goozed....it was really too good to be true!

For those not familiar with bun bo hue, it's essentially a Vietnamese soup containing rice vermicelli (bun), beef (bo) which originates from Hue which is a city in the central part of Vietnam. The name is a little misleading though because the soup contains a lot of pork. \n\nI usually go to Pho Linh when I'm having a craving for bun bo hue. They definitely do one of the best bun bo hue soups in the city of Toronto. I dropped by for a late lunch and I was quickly seated. I ordered a small bun bo hue ($8.50 plus tax). The soup was really good. The broth had a spicy lemongrass flavour profile that was rich, flavourful and complex. It had cha lua (slices of Vietnamese pork sausage), beef shank and pig feet/knuckle in it. The rice vermicelli was of the thicker kind and was perfectly cooked. Only thing missing was the congealed pork blood cubes.\n\nI have been to Pho Linh quite a few times over the years and the pho, vermicelli and rice dishes are pretty decent but their best dish is definitely their bun bo hue soup which is only offered on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. If you are looking for an alternative to pho and willing to try something more adventurous at Pho Linh, order the bun bo hue. No need to add hoisin sauce or sriracha sauce to the bun bo hue soup.

Banh Cuon was the best of the whole meal, I had better, but over all they do have a decent Banh Cuon. Pho was just ok, the noodles in the Pho was good, but the soup is missing a lots of spices and flavor. I can't even smell the aroma of the Pho. Bun Bo Hue was....NOT Bun Bo Hue, it's more like Bun Bo, which is just simply beef broth, beef, and noodles; it would be ok if they just call it Bun Bo. The broth is missing the taste of the real Bun Bo Hue. As for the Com Tam Bi Suon Cha, the grilled pork wasn't tasty, and missing that grilled aroma; the Cha has no taste.\nThe service was ok, nothing to say about it.\nSorry but this place is a NO NO", 2], ["My favourite pho place in toronto. The price is reasonable and the food is always consistent. I go to pho linh almost every saturday! They have bun bo hue only on the weekends. So i like to get that that soup noodle.

I've been coming here for the most part of my life and the food has always been mouth watering. \n\nMy family use to come here all the time whenever we felt like eating out, so this definitely brings back some memories. \n\nWe ordered the cha gio (spring rolls x 2), pho dac biet, a small Banh cuon, and a bun cha gio. Everything came out so quickly and fresh. It still blows my mind how they pump food out so quickly but also with such high quality. \n\nThe pho broth is hands down the best. It's so refreshing and clean (not cloudy or oily). Perfect amount of brisket, beef balls, tripe, tendon, and noodles. Add some fresh lime and mint. You're golden. This is one bowl that is a definite must get when you check this place out. \n\nI'd also highly suggest the cha gio. This is not your Asian spring roll. The wrap I believe is made with rice paper and damn it's so good too. A little bit of fish sauce... my mouth is watering right now. Must try this as well. \n\nThe Banh cuon is a staple dish too. Basically little rice wraps that you eat with fish sauce too. Bite size that is just right for an app (if you get a small). \n\nThe bun I'm not the biggest fan, although still really good. I'm just not a dry noodle kinda guy! If you're looking for a skinny noodle with some lettuce, spring rolls, and basically a salad with noodles. \n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend pho linh to anyone that's in this neighbourhood.

I wasn't a fan of the pork leg or the shrimp (the shrimp didn't taste super fresh)\n\nThe fresh rolls I wasn't thrilled about either (especially for $2.50 per roll).

The pho came 5-10 minutes after ordering. Service was friendly, quick and efficient. The broth was steaming hot and very flavourful.

However, I was served fresh noodles, but to my surprise, they were not soggy at all! Great portion of meat to noodles. Price was fair, for L and XL. S is $8, but it was definitely too small. I also ordered a mango smoothie and an avocado smoothie to try. Both tasted very refreshing, mango smoothie was slightly too sweet for my liking, but still good. Would try their durian smoothie next time. Service picked up quickly around the lunch hours and a line was formed.

I also ordered the banh beo, which consists of small steamed rice cakes topped with chopped dried shrimp, scallions, mung bean paste, crispy fried shallots and nuoc mam (fish sauce). The texture of the banh beo was flawless, it wasn't soft and nor was it powdery (I've actually had banh beo made like this and it was not pleasant), I figured that if the banh pho was made well that the banh beo would come to par.

Sometimes, however, when ordering the pho, they cut the chicken pieces a little too think, and these pieces are also very dry.

They also have a variety of genuine Vietnamese drinks that should be tried since you might not find them at any other Vietnamese restaurants such as che ba mau, suong sao etc. since the make time is a bit tedious.

It had a very weird tasting sauce on top. \n\nAside from the food, I just felt that my dishes were very unsanitary. We had to switch plates because we noticed how dirty it was.

Even though their food is super average (which is quite frankly, MOST buffet places), I liked the variety that they offered. Sure, the soup dumpling skin is too thick and probably was frozen beforehand, but what other place actually offers soup dumplings at an AYCE? They also had my beloved pork blood jello, salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi, eel sushi, fried milk, cow innards, and other items that you don't normally see at AYCE dim sum places, all offered at a reasonable buffet price. \nIf you're looking for an average AYCE place that has dim sum and Japanese food, this is a great place. However, if you're looking for high quality, this would not be the place for you.", 3], ["So, despite my poor experience last time, I came back again.  This time, to try all you can eat dimsum.  This also includes a Japanese all tou can eat menu as well.  I am say I really like the choices on the menus.  So many items to choose from!!!  And I also like the portions that came.  It's larger plates than most other restaurants.  The food is fresh too.\nThe only thing I would suggest is to change the chairs.  They are not proportionate to the height of the tables.  Kinda low.   Not so comfortable.\nAYCE during the weekend cost us $27.99 each.\nWill come back again.", 4], ["With heavy heart just want to highlight my experience at this restaurant. Just walk by and got to know open till 2 am and pretty amazed. The place is not so crowded, beside very clean and nice deco.

The first impression is very nice , then when it comes to order , since this is my first time and I think I didn't realize I need to write down the dimsum and sushi in different column. The server who became little aggressive and come to me and yell at me you can't see where I need to write down in different column , I said that's my first time and can u help me with that, she insisting and told me I need to read to her , since I order lots of things and it became little messy. I still ask my server if she can help me to differentiate, she refused immediately. What the f*** how can she be so rude. I lost my appetite and just left from the restaurant . Really disappointing and messed my dinner. The front cashier and the girl mobbing the floor has nice and friendly attitude.

I didn't have high hopes for the quality, but still wanted to try as the buffet combo was pretty unique. I liked it better than I thought I would. The quality was decent and the taste of the food was good. Sushi seemed pretty fresh. Came here with a group of 15 and was seated right away. The food came out pretty quick as well. They also open very late so if you ever crave sushi or dim sum late at night this is the place to go.", 4], ["TLDR: nice place for dim sum but expensive. Some dishes are hit or miss.\n\nI came here with my family for breakfast. The service was quite fast and the ladies were really attentive and kind. This was a nice contrast to typical dim sum places where it's the Asian way to be a little more rude and not care too much about service; but to push food out. I really appreciated that.\n\nThe food was quite good for classics like Siu Mai, Har Gow, chicken feet, ox intestines, and congealed pig blood that we had today. Unfortunately, the beef short ribs and noodle platters were overly seasoned with pepper and salt which dried out mouths so badly. Definitely would not recommend these 2. On top of it, our beef short ribs were undercooked and super chewy that it was hard to eat--shame.\n\nThe place is really clean and quite spacious. There's a lower and upper floor level. It was interesting to see how the lower floor gets the food through a dumbwaiter system--cool!\n\nDespite the fairly good experience, I wouldn't come here that often because of how pricey it is.", 4], ["Rosewood is located on the south side of Dundas between Spadina and Huron in the heart of Chinatown.\n\nDim Sum is always great on a Sunday morning.

If you can't eat either of those two you'll be missing out on much of the menu that you'd be able to order from.  I particularly enjoyed the fried beef short rib.  It was like having beef jerky but a bit (heat) hot and crunchy.  Most everything if it wasn't available in a dip already had what seemed to be copious quantities of sodium.  Yes, this food is salty and we love it.\n\nThe fried dough in rice noodle was enjoyable and there's other versions of the same thing with different fillings and besides all the shrimp they did have squid tentacles as well.  I didn't really like the squid.  It didn't seem to be as well cooked as I would have liked being flimsy and the batter seemed to be greasy.\n\nThe boneless fried chicken is always a great staple and we even had some salmon and unagi nigiri although not much.\n\nThe food at Rosewood was good but I can say that I've had better dim sum.

On the menu it has a lot of cheap food like 3 dollars for a bowl of peanut butter noodles. Yep, PEANUT BUTTER noodles.

No need to worry, as there is a customer lull in the early evening, before the bars get out and after the dinner rush is over.

Since there are so many customers, the waiters are constantly running around and taking orders. They don't notice that you're waiting to order unless you raise your hand. This isn't your typical dim sum restaurants where the food is being strolled on carts. The food also takes a long time to arrive; they don't come out all at once. Sometimes, the last meal comes out 15 minutes or more after the first meal arrived. However, the food is 95% of the time fresh and hot. The shrimp rice rolls have a gooey texture, which can be disturbing to some and the shrimp they use isn't the typical baby shrimp, but the regular-sized ones. The Baked BBQ Pork Buns are DELICIOUS and are an absolute must-try if you are dining at Rosewood Cuisine. The top is somewhat sweet, but the inside is savory; you get the best of both worlds.  \n\nThey also serve AYCE sushi, which I have yet to try, but it does look tasty! From what I've seen, the sushi is nicely presented. My mom loves this place, so I'll be coming back.", 3], ["Surprisingly good! I grew up eating authentic Chinese food, and the dishes that my friend and I ordered were very good.

I was also upset that only my two friends out of 5 of us ordered a bottle of sprite but we all got charged for a sprite.

This ends up being about 44$ or so, but still cheaper than the 27$/person AYCE option. \n\nThe one thing to note that frustrates me is that many of the flat noodles do contain cilantro. Most of the options do state that it includes it, but the BBQ pork option does not say it. Be careful and look at the menu pictures if your avoiding the cilantro.

I was taken aback when the waitress informed me that if I wanted the vegetarian menu, I would have to go to their website to view it?!?! A few minutes later the other waiter brought the vegetarian menu and apologized for the mishap.\n\nI started my meal with the Crispy Fried Fish Tacos (3 pieces) with salsa and avocado.

When I picked up the third taco, guess what! I found out that all the creamy dressing was in the slaw on the third taco; it had soaked through the shell, and when I picked up the taco, it broke apart and was a soggy mess.

So I basically sat there, watching my spouse eating the vegetarian appetizer, with no food. My fish tacos appetizer was served only after my spouse finished eating the vegan appetizer.

As much as I loved it, I don't think I would repurchase since it is quite expensive - $8.50 for 6 half-pieces. The tacos were also great! The shell was very soft and all the ingredients were super fresh. Would definitely come back to try the other tacos. Lastly, the octopus tapa was my favourite.

We were so impressed with the quality of the food and practically licked our plates clean lol. For dessert we had the tres leches (highly recommend) and the cheesecake (not as mind blowing as everything else and very yummy still). My fianc\u00e9 already can't wait to go back to try more stuff off the menu. The chef is a genius!", 5], ["Had the Pad Thai and the Argentinian steak with shrimp and fries. The dishes are not served at the same time (is that a tapas thing?) so we started with the  Pad Thai and it was bland and very ordinary. The steak & shrimp was much better but starting with the Pad Thai gave us a bad impression. Also we went when it was very busy and had to flag a waitress down to get our order in...worth another try if we have that kind of money to spend but we know of many other places with better food and service for the same $$$", 3], ["Really good food but very expensive for what you get.

Was a little concerned about it being empty, but walked in and was greeted warmly right away by the cutest recently landed Korean girl.\n\nThe decor was amazing. Beautiful and well thought through. The lighting piece above the bar was awesome and I want it in my house. The paintings were lovely too and shockingly started a great conversation between me and the hubby (our first art chat!!)\n\nWe had our choice of seats, so we took the corner booth near the door, which also gave us a great view into the open kitchen. Menus were distributed (Asian Latin Tapas) (on paper for now as they are testing the waters) and drinks ordered. \n\nWe ordered fried calamari (10$) and the shrimp ceviche (10$) and were very surprised when a free bowl of curry chips (6.50$) came in tandem. We think it was either a freebie as they had just opened, or a freebie because they were empty. Both the calamari and chips were hot and crunchy and absolutely to die for delicious. The ceviche was cold and creamy and perfectly balanced. A bit light on the salt, but that is fine dining for you!\n\nFor dinner I ordered the recommended marinated chicken with olive salad (16$). The hubby got the Argentinian steak with fries and added a side of shrimp (18$ +8$ for the shrimp). Both were absolutely perfect! The steak was a bit chewy, but it was due to a bit of connective tissue and not the cooking (which was perfect). The chicken was moist (brined maybe) and fall-y apart-y in my mouth-y.\n\nAfter, we were offered dessert wine or coffee, we politely declined as we were stuffed to the gills. We did have a lovely chat with both Chef Manh (formerly of Supermarket) and Gina (the cutest server ever!) and after about two hours, found our way back home.\n\nCame to 100$ total, including two beers and a glass of house red.\nLoved it and cannot wait to go back.\nMaybe tonight.", 4], ["This place truly is a hidden gem in Etobicoke.

The fish tacos were delicious and are good tapa size. Although the fish tacos were good, I've had better at other places.

There were dough bits in the noodles which the chef said were gnocchi. Who would think to put gnocchi in chow mein? It was probably the best dish we ate.the chef/owner came over to our table and gave us a complimentary piece of Mexican tres leche cake. The cake was so moist and delicious like a pound cake.

All of which we perfectly cooked, and seasoned.  Each bite offered a different flavour.  We both ordered a large tapa, which we shared, Pad Thai and the Grilled Argentina Steak.  We were really surprised with the Pad Thai since it was so fresh tasting and balanced.  The Grilled steak was to die for, with a butter sauce I could have eaten with a spoon.  \n\nI can honestly say I have a hard time choosing a favour item from the meal.  \n\nThe only reason I have them 4 out of 5 was the decor.

It is a go-to restaurant of a friend who lives by the area and it is a hidden gem that I recommend you go to before more good reviews make it a go-to place for many more people. The plates are mainly asian with some latin influence. They are meant for sharing but we felt that they could be eaten individually as well (except for the Argentinean steak and fries - that was delicious and should be shared). We had fresh spring rolls, lemongrass pork, fried calamari, pad thai, wok fried green vegetables, thai fried rice, yellow curry shrimp... everything was good. My favourites were the lemongrass pork and Argentinean steak. And the desserts... I'm a dessert person and they were some of the best I have ever had. They only had 2 desserts - tres leches & port wine poached peaches with ice cream. Both were perfect. We were amazed that this place was not busy at all. Service was friendly.

We had a party of 8 and booked a private dining room. Their service was impeccable. I ordered the escargot as an appetizer and it was the best I've had. The mushrooms on top were full and round, unlike the ones at The Keg, which were tiny and often not a full mushroom. The snails themselves were very meaty, again comparing to The Keg's, which had some pieces of shells in them and were rather small. Next I got the surf & turf, which was a filet mignon and half a live lobster. Their lobster was the freshest ones I've had in a long while! Super juicy and you can taste the ocean. They provide you with clamps to open the shells and butter warmed over a candle as well. \n\nTheir filet mignon on the other hand was a bit off that night. I ordered it to be cooked to medium but received a medium well and even almost well done. There was a lot of salt on one side of the steak such that my last few bites of it were very salty and chewy. Others whom I shared the night with that day also had the same experience with their steaks being overcooked. That being said, they serve garlic bread instead of regular bread to start off the meal (!!), as well as small sides such as baked mushrooms (all plump and round, seasoned well), spinach, and pickled vegetables along with your mains. \n\nDessert was as well a bit off, which is common among all steakhouses, but nonetheless thoughtful. It was a bit too sweet for us but their \"the house\" chocolate mousse comes in the form of an actual house made with white and dark chocolate! Overall this place was delightful and would be suitable for special celebrations and groups!", 4], ["The good: Pleasant staff.\n\nThe bad: I struggle to understand why this place commands the respect it does beyond its overpriced yet extensive wine list & large cellar. There are restos that have a more aesthetically pleasing & comfortable interior and superior cut of meats & extensive menu from keg on the low end to Jacobs for an ultra luxe experience.

Finally I've had a mouthwatering steak that melted in my mouth with a reasonable price!

First they brought us complimentary garlic breads and pickled yummies. Me and my fianc\u00e9 shared the escargot and French onion soup to start - mmm delicious. For our main we ordered 16 oz ribeye steak -he got his medium well and I got mine well done - and both were perfection. We also got 3 drinks. At the end plus taxes the bill was $146.00 and we both couldn't finish our big steak. If you were planning on going to the keg.. don't go.. come here instead. Same price-ish but way better quality.

While both were excellent, the lobster salad was exquisite. Full of large, sweet chunks of lobster, nearly a meal in and of itself.\n\nMy better half ordered a filet, as close to well done as the chef dared. And to their credit, it was exactly to her liking.

Lamb was Raw, and our filet mignon was raw. \n-Took FOREVER to cook the steaks, sat there tor 2.5 hours full meal, app, main, dessert. \n\nIn all, I would not come back to this steakhouse unless I was there for desserts.

The restaurant inhabits an old 1860's house so much of the d\u00e9cor inside of the establishment retained that old-fashioned feeling. The ambiance of Barberian's Steakhouse was good as the place offers a cozy and warm dining experience. My companions and I were quickly seated and got a table in the middle of the room for a party of four.\n\nThe meal started off with complimentary garlic bread with butter, and some cooked vegetables. I snacked on the garlic bread as I looked through their dinner menu. Additionally, the menu offers a good selection of steaks ranging from $40.00 to $100.00+.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Surf & Turf (Filet Mignon &  1/2 Live Lobster); the menu says \"market price\" so I didn't know the actual cost of the dish at the time of ordering. Mine came out to be $78, but prices do vary. \n\nThe filet mignon was a thick piece of beef that was gently browned and seasoned with the steakhouse's signature spice. The spice that was used at Barberian's Steakhouse really added flavor to the steak. My dish also came with a side order, which I chose fries (as I usually do). Unfortunately, I did not like the fries as it was a little dry. The lobster portion of the meal was huge, and it had a lot of meat. The chunks of lobster were absolutely delectable, especially when dipped into the hot butter.  \n\nJ ordered the 16 oz rib steak ($57.50), and he thought that it was delicious as well. I didn't try his plate so I can't comment on his cut of steak.\n\nPrices aren't cheap, but dinner for two was certainly more affordable (in the sense of high-end dining only) here compared to our $500+ bills at Jacob's & Co.

The Lamb was phenomenal. Portions are very much on the larger side. Be cognisant about how much you're ordering.

Not overbearing. \n\nRestaurant is an old-school steakhouse atmosphere, darkly lit, tired wall paper, antique wooden chairs , pictures of old white men on the walls.  Kinda like an old Victorian home library. Dated. \n\nAppetizer : corn chowder was the soup of the day. I had to add salt and black pepper for deeper flavour. It was fine. 3/5. \n\nMain: halibut was the fish of the day and it was also just fine. Simple seasoning , no exciting flavours. I had the baked potato. Again , classic , simple flavours here. 3/5. \n\nShared Sides: Brussels sprouts were roasted with salt and black pepper. Tasty. Onion rings were a 5/5. Very good. Fries were limp and poorly made. Needs improvement 1/5. Garlic bread was awesome. 5/5. Pickled veggies were decent but again very simple flavours 4/5. \n\nDessert: frozen ice cream eclair. Too tough and Unmanageable. Should be swapped out with a different dessert idea 1/5. Mousse chocolate house \nIs the signature dessert and was good and creative. 5/5. Caramel flan was just fine nothing special 3/5. Homemade chocolate ice cream had a very deep, rich flavour. Excellent 5/5. Cinnamon and apple pastry with vanilla ice cream was the clear winner here 5/5. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for an exciting menu with bold and interesting flavours in its menu items do not come here. This is a classic steakhouse that is not very fussy and prides itself on a consistent experience over the decades. It's not trying to compete with modern steakhouse and maybe that is exactly what its customers can appreciate. Predictability. \n\nNot a great \"happening\" date place for a younger couple but probably for your parents. :)", 3], ["My favourite steakhouse in Toronto.

Oh, and more butter came with it. \n\nI ordered 6 oysters, which were really good but be carful... the horseradish is insanely spicy.\n\nFinally, the main. The 16oz ribeye, medium rare, with fries.

I couldn't give it a 1 because I've been to a place a few years back that charged me $120 for an 8oz steak that was one of the worst steaks of my life so they get to keep the 1 rating for themselves.\n\nOverall, I hate to say that Barbarian's earned itself a 3 star rating.\n\nNow, I've recently been wondering if it's fair to criticize a place without offering solutions so here goes.\n\nIf you're going to charge as much money as you do, get creative with side dishes. As an example, offer up something like pulled pork bourbon mac and cheese, make the fries into a good quality poutine, get creative with a savory ice cream that could be served together with the steak.\n\nYou may argue that you don't want to detract from the steak experience but then you just have to think about how to complement that experience.

Throw in some gently garlic-ed, warm crusty bread and it was like a time warp into another era when life was less complicated.\n\nMike was the name of the burly, smiling bartender.  I met the sommelier, a petite woman, Christine, who is breaking through this traditional bastion of manliness.  Kudos to her!  I also met the owner, Arrron, who'd been greeting people and working the room with a warm smile.  He had one of those sincere handshakes that uses both hands.\n\nSerously if I lived in Toronto this would be my preferred place to relax after work with a couple of pals while being entertained by the super-cool staff.  Nice!", 5], ["Brought my fianc\u00e9 here as a treat for his birthday and it was a nice experience but I'm not sure if it warranted the hefty bill at the end. We both got caesar salads for starters, for mains I got the 8oz filet mignon (medium) with the baked potato & saut\u00e9ed mushrooms,  he got the 16oz rib steak (medium rare) with Bearnaise sauce, mashed potatoes & a jumbo shrimp and for dessert we shared the apple beignets. The caesars were OK, quite fishy tasting which I liked but my fianc\u00e9 didn't. The steaks were cooked perfectly and were so tasty! The baked potato comes with sour cream, bacon bits & feta which was yummy but I wish I had gotten the mashed potatoes as they were unreal - well worth the upgrade! The apple beignets were so good and perfect for sharing. Overall, the food & wine were great, the service was spot on and the ambiance was nice. It was lovely for the special occasion that was in it but I just doubt that we'll come here again as $300 for a meal is a bit much I think.", 3], ["Truly one of the finest restaurants in Toronto although they are quickly pricing themselves out of business.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy and inviting.

The onions and green beans were, themselves, delicious.  Hell, the mashed potato was awesome. \n\nYes, it is very dark inside.  Stepping out into a late afternoon sun is a very fascinating experience.  But it's so comforting inside.

As it is, I hope to return in the future.", 4], ["Warning - I am a high end steak joint regular around the US, so my standards are pretty high.\n\nI had the rib steak which was OK.  Probably a 3 star steak for the price.  It is not advertised how long it was aged for, nor whether it was dry or wet aged.\n\nThey did have a special 40 day aged steak for $70.  I didn't think that it would be worth that price.  I had just had a 100 day aged steak in Boston for like $50, and that was the best steak I had ever had.\n\nSo the steak was OK, the wines by the glass list had 5 or 6 reds and the same amount of whites.  I was pleased with the selection of by the glass wines.  By myself, so a bottle was to much wine.\n\nAtmosphere was good.  I like old-school steak joints.  I sat at the bar, which was small, only 3 uncomfortable seats.\n\nStaff was 5 star.  \n\nFirst steakhouse I have tried in Toronto, so I can't baseline it to the others.

I called back and told them that I was expecting s call from them to make a large reservation and he guy was very rude to me. He didn't apologize that they didn't call back. He then asked me how many people and for what time. I told him and he said I'll see you then and hung up. Not polite at all for a high scale restaurant.  Felt more of cocky attitude as if my business didn't matter and the restaurant would fill up anyways. Good thing their steak is good.

The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. \n*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself \u200d it's just placed uncooked in the center.  \n\nDesserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. \n\nNot a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions. \nBut if you're into fusion menus and meat in everything  - this is definitely a great place to go for that.", 2], ["Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.\n\nService: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.\n\nFood: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.\n\nOverall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated.", 3], ["Really delicious food.  The Santo Stefano pizza is a classic with arugula, buffalo mozzarella, and prosciutto.  Probably the best buffalo mozzarella I've had outside of Naples, Italy.  \n\nThe C't Mang pizza is a delicious white pizza with lots of mozzarella, Gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, smoked prosciutto, and honey.  So sweet and tasty.  \n\nI washed them down with sweet pear nectar and finished off my dinner with two scoops of gelato.  The hazelnut was rich and creamy, and the lemon flavor had a nice tang and was cool and refreshing.  \n\nYou do sit quite close to the next table, so I bumped elbows once with the lady next to me.

I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. \n\nHowever, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether.

Their usual suspects are also good but this one has become my go to. The eggplant is fried and goes perfectly with the sausage. Must try. \n\nTheir classic Bolognese pasta is also a must try.

My bill was almost $40 for a main and two apps split among 5 people, but I left quite satisfied and full.\n\nWe started off with the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari for the table. I wasn't the biggest fan of the carpaccio, which was thinly sliced raw beef served with spicy arugula and shaved cheese, drizzled with lemon juice. The contrast of the smooth beef, rich cheese, and harsh bite of the arugula was an interesting combination. I did, however, love the grilled calamari! The portion size was mediocre; there were only about three small pieces there. That said, it was grilled to a nice crisp and char, and was so flavourful! I enjoyed that it was also served on a leafy bed of greens with tomatoes, making it a nice and light starter.\n\nMy main was the Spaghetti in Canna al Mare - a tomato based spaghetti topped with different seafood such as clams, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. I was very pleasantly surprised at how generous they were with the toppings. My plate had lots of calamari and roughly 8 mussels/clams, along with two meaty shrimps. I wouldn't say that the seafood is very fresh, but the slightly spicy and tangy tomato sauce helped add some flavour and depth. The portions are actually a decent size too - I was unable to finish mine, but fortunately a friend pitched in and helped!\n\nMy friend ordered a pizza, and although I forget which one he got, I distinctly remember him asking the server for the one with the most meat (guys will forever be guys). I sampled a small bite, and it was pretty good! There's a fair amount of cheesy goodness on top, and the crust is super thin. There's a nice crunch when you bite into it. Our main complaint is that the pizza arrives uncut - and you're expected to use your fork and knife to manage.\n\nOn that note, keep in mind that Terroni doesn't really allow for substitutions or modifications (e.g., doesn't accommodate no cheese or sub cheese requests), and that extends towards asking for their pizza cut. Although my experience here was quite lovely, though I believe there are plenty other Italian places in the city to visit and will be unlikely to return anytime soon!", 4], ["Had a delicious dinner here my first nite in Toronto. Beautiful space in an incredible historic building.

We did make an earlier reso so that we could enjoy some fun out and about after dinner but due to construction and Toronto sports team traffic we were nearly 40 minutes late for our time slot.

I mean they have more dining rooms I think than I have fingers (and maybe toes). And somehow, it was fully booked, not an open seat in sight. It's no wonder it's one of the top Italian restaurants in Toronto. I've heard that it used to be a bank and that some of the dining occurs in one of the old vaults - which is awesome.\n\nWe got to dine in the wine cellar which is a lot quieter than the rest of the venue (there was a DJ on the main floor), and obviously less people here as well. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nDrinks:\n- A bellini and an aperol spritz for drinks. The bellini here was much nicer than the crushed ice versions at local chains - it actually was a properly made cocktail with alcohol you could taste. The spritz served as a perfect appertivo to get the hunger motor running.\n- To go with dinner we ordered a bottle of the Terre Montepulciano, which was about $60 and not the most expensive bottle by far but was a great taste and value that went with both of our meals\n\nAppetizers\n- Funghi Assoluti and Calamari Griglia. My wife had the Funghi and loved it, and my grilled calamari were one of the most tender and most flavourful I've had in years. Nice taste of the flame on it and a little acidity to to taste\n\nMains:\n- My wife had the Tortelloni Ricotta which were 4-5 green coloured giant ricotta filled pasta finished in a sage butter sauce. She definitely didn't leave any for leftovers\n- I went with one of their signature dishes, The Tonnarelli Norcina which as you might see from my picture is a thicker spaghetti type noodle but with a tube down the center. This dish was topped with a ton of crumbled sausage meat and more shaved truffles than I've ever seen before. I don't understand how this dish was only $25. I had to be valued way higher on the truffles alone.\n\nDessert:\n- Profiterols and an Affogato alla Crema. What can you say more about profitterols and ice cream with espresso on top. MOLTO BENE!\n\nOur server Julian was absolutely the best, making strong suggestions, and keeping our interests in mind when making recommendations.

I booked a reservation here out of convenience since it was walkable to the ACC for a concert.\n\nIf you're looking for a romantic night out, this isn't the place to go since it's louder than most restaurants (if you're on the ground floor) because of the high ceilings. Also, the tables are very close together which makes it uncomfortable to squeeze by the neighbouring table when you have to get in and out of your seat if you're the one sitting against the wall.\n\nThere isn't a shortage of food and drink options here but their food was just okay for me this time. I ordered a lamb pasta with dandelions in a tomato based sauce, while my husband ordered the ravioli stuffed with duck confit, fig and butternut squash in a cream sauce. Both sounded really unique and we hadn't tried either dishes before here. It was a surprise when the dishes came out in 10 minutes. It turned out to be a bit disappointing because I remember the pasta tasting really good at the other Terroni location and it was just average here...something was off about the flavours, though my husband's order tasted a bit better than mine. The portion size was good though and the dishes were filling. The tastiness of the tiramisu for dessert made up for the averageness of our entrees. \n\nService was okay. Our server was nice enough but I guess since the place was busy, she wasn't as attentive as we barely saw her in our area. We also felt a bit rushed even though we had only been there for just over an hour - it's like they wanted to keep clearing out tables as quick as possible.\n\nAll in all, not a terrible restaurant to go to for Italian food but not the most memorable either.", 3], ["Highly recommend this Italian restaurant for special occasions/ dates.

However, this caused some difficulties when ordering, especially for my parents who haven't eaten Italian cuisine much.\n\nWe all ended up ordering pastas, none of us expecting what exactly we were going to get. \n\nBread quickly came out after we ordered. The bread was fantastic. I just thought it was a bit weird that they brought exactly three pieces, one for each of us.\n\n\nI ordered the zucca which was your typical butternut squash ravioli. I thought it was pretty good. My dad ordered the Rigatoni alla Norma which I thought was my favourite. I could really taste the quality of each single pasta, and the sauce was fantastic. My mom ordered the Spaghetti al Limone At first we got a bit nervous because it looked extremely small portion. However each pasta was filled with cheese which made it dense.

The ice cream tasted a little off, not sure what flavor it was but it was still a great dessert.\n\nIt's a very great atmosphere catching up with friends with a drink. it's a darker lighting so if you don't like that, not for you. Overall, the drinks and food are very flavorful, a tad on the expensive end but worth a try or for those occasional gatherings or even on a date. I would go again some day.", 4], ["We tried Terroni's because we had heard so many people rave about it.  The food was overall good but nothing hugely redeeming about it.   Some of it seemed to lack flavour so we requested chilies which helped.  Of course, that's a personal preference and not everyone's cup of tea.   My husband ordered a chocolate cannoli and some gelato to finish off the evening.   He said that the cannoli was exceptional, better than most that he has had at Italian bakeries.   Service was perfectly fine as well, ambiance also nice.  It's loud but the venue lends itself to it.  So overall, a good experience.  Would we go back again?  Probably not since Toronto is full of so many diverse restaurants that we would like to try.", 4], ["I've been to this location a few times now and honestly, it could be a million times better. \n\nThe tables are so close together that I feel like I'm have a conversation with my table neighbour. The last time I was there with my husband we barely said two words to each other during the entire meal because the tables on each side of us were deep in conversation. I know the life story of both couples now! I've had this experience downstairs and upstairs as well. \n\nOn all occasions the hostesses are lovely and take their job seriously. They are well organized and are always smiling. The servers on the other hand are not so awesome. On more than one occasion the server looked annoyed with my friends and I because 1.) we asked for recommendations and then 2.) asked for a little more time. This beats another experience where no one even came to our table for 20min. I'm not joking, we timed it, 20min just for the server to come over and take our drink order. \n\nWe wait what feels like years for drink refills and to have our order taken. The food takes almost as long. \n\nThe food is good though. I've gotten the cheese board which I love and the crispy calamari which is also delicious. The warm mushroom salad came highly recommended and it was a good choice as well. I always get the same pizza - walnut, pear and gorgonzola. That flavour combination is awesome and is hands down, one of my most favourite pizzas ever. The chili pepper oil they give you for the pizza is amazing. I had to ask for a second bowl last time. I would put that on everything if I could. \n\nOne thing I really dislike, WHY DON'T YOU CUT YOUR PIZZA?! Honestly I feel like I'm going to knock everything off the table as I try to cut the pizza into slices. It drives me bonkers. Just cut the pizza for your customers. They're paying enough for it!\n\nThe location is nice, the ambiance is great too. Love that there's a DJ all night long. \n\nWill I come back? Possibly, but it would have to be because I was in the area.

It was only served with oil, no vinegar or butter. Also we were a little disappointed with the size of the beer- expected a standard pint but only got a teeney 330ml, considering it was around the price of a typical pint.\n\nService- I appreciated the fast and friendly service, especially considering how packed the place was. I visited with my boyfriend on a weeknight and checked the \"Special Occasion - Anniversary\" box when making the reservation. The fact that it asked led me to believe that they would acknowledge it in some way, but we still found ourselves crammed in a busy, casual after-work-drinks section although there were definitely some more quieter intimate sections. Nonetheless the venue is beautiful!", 3], ["Food here was ok. I love gnocchi so I had to try that. I did find that my gnocchi was a little colder in the middle, seeming to be frozen still. The reason why this review is only 2 stars is because the service was TERRIBLE. We went around 5 pm (early dinner) and even when the restaurant was basically empty, the service was so bad.

This is the hospitality industry and they failed in every aspect.", 1], ["I'm so torn on how to rate Terroni. The ambiance is killer from the moment you set eyes on the exterior of the restaurant as it's located in the old Toronto Courthouse. This continues as you step in the doors past glass displays of curing meat along a deli-bar section, past a red carpeted stair case and DJ booth into the seating area...and that's just the first floor. Upstairs is a huge hall with it's very own bar and kitchen. There are a lot of interesting art pieces that make it more than just an antique including the very macabre hanging humans and also a huge modern light centerpiece. With it's loud music, it's the spot to go out for drinks or a fun date. \n\nThat all sounds fantastic but the food is really meh. I shared a polentona pizza as an appetizer which was just bad. It was actually a dry pizza. It was essentially crust with proscuitto and soggy pine nuts (despite lacking sauce and cheese) between that and the crust. Looking at the other pizzas on the menu a lot of them were not in contention to be ordered because they seemed too disjointed and out there. I'm all for being new and adventurous but throwing the kitchen sink at something doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be good. I had the tortellini as my main. This was decent. Good portion size, stuffed full of ricotta and had a good amount of sauce. I took a bite of my friend's pappardelle which was again, really dry. I'm not looking for chicken noodle soup level of sauce but that dish was a big bowl of pasta and I'm not sure how you choke down that amount of dry pasta. One saving grace for the taste buds was the chocolate lava cake. That thing is insane. Again this restaurant is a little weird with its execution of things as there was just untreated fruit thrown on the side of the plate (blueberries with the stems still on them). It just didn't seem to jive with the fullness and richness of the cake.\n\nAnyways the ambiance is 100 but the quality of the food we experienced was hugely hit or miss and ranged from bad to amazing and I do have to echo the sentiments regarding the service (or lack thereof).", 3], ["Had a send off lunch with our office group and the decision makers made Terroni as the choice partly because very able to accommodate our large group of almost 20 - especially during the upcoming holiday season. \n\nIf I had to rate the restaurant only on atmosphere, Terroni would get a 5/5. However we go to eat in a restaurant. The checkin was super quick even though it was during lunch time. We got to seat at the upper level and although good, but not as good as the main floor. The bar section is super good and classy. \n\nThe orders were taken quickly and were served bread, olive oil and oil with red chillies. The bread was OK, but the chillies and were super good. Not very spicy, but very flavourful. \n\nOrdered a Marinara pizza, has no cheese. Comes with Tomato Sauce, herbs, basil and garlic. The crust was good, the sauce lacked flavour. My palate isn't strong so could hardly taste garlic. The pizza was just plain. Regardless of how one orders a pizza (a vegan option) and as it was on the menu and I didn't omit cheese, the pizza should pass the taste test. It didn't. The experience of fine dinning regardless of the dish ordered needed to be there and it wasn't. I have vegan dishes at many places and they all passed with flying colours (O&B, Drake, Liberetto to name a few)\n\nService was very good.

She came back and said No, but offered to give us a new dish if we didn't like it. The dish itself was fine, so we didn't replace it with anything, but I guess it was a major letdown because of how it used to be served (i.e. large truffle shavings). The pasta was super al dente - a bit too hard for our liking. \n\nRavioli di Zio Paperone: Was ok - edges of the ravioli were still too al dente for my liking, but it's just a personal preference. Flavors were alright, nothing special. \n\nTiramisu: Served in a jar - was very creamy and tasted like it should. \n\nI've been to three Terroni locations now and all have been an average experience, but their pastas are always too al dente for me.

My last visit there wasn't as exciting as the ones before, and I found the food a bit generic and the service was a bit slow. \nStill if you're a fan of French cuisine (like I am!) you've got to try this place.

Although this restaurant is part of the O&B family, I think its quite a high quality restaurant.\n\nSummerlicious dinner ($38)\nFor starters I had the marinated seafood salad was really tasty. There was a decent amount of seafood - the mussels and calamari were fresh ingredients. The calamari were soft but slightly chewy. I had the herb and mustard crusted pork tenderloin for the main. This was amazing! The pork meat was cooked just right, super tender and juicy, not dry at all. The mustard crust were along the ends of the pork adding a nice crunch and kick in flavor in each bite. Caramelized pineapple upside down cake for dessert, served with vanilla ice cream. The cake was good, not too sweet, but tasted really good adding ice cream in each bite.\n\nFoie Gras du Jour ($21)\nThe way they serve foie gras depends on the chef's daily inspiration. I found that was pretty neat. Expensive for a 3 piece appetizer, but it was really deliciosu! We had the foie gras spread served in a puff pastry, topped on a goat cheese spread and raspberry dressing. The foie gras was really good, rich in flavor! It doesn't look obvious but there's actually a perfect amount of foie gras inside the puff complementing each other. The goat cheese spread was really creamy and adds extra flavor to the puffs.", 4], ["A 3.5 star experience. My husband and I arrived at 5:45 pm Tuesday night for an early dinner before a 7:30 Raptors game. I advised the hostess when I made the reservation that we needed to leave in 75 minutes. No joke- they advised all the 3 servers who attended our table. Our main server kept an eye on all the entrees to ensure we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes between courses, and did not forget about us when the place got busy at around 6:30.\n\nI was disappointed about their salmon tartar served on a bed of lentils, under some beets and pickled beets. The pickled beets were too overpowering. Then came my main entree - the sesame crusted tuna was cooked to perfection!

We had the filet de boeuf and pork and they were really quite good.  The pork definitely lost out to the beef though in terms of taste and flavour.  The portion was a bit too small as well.  The beef, however, was one of the most perfect steaks I've ever had. Finally, dessert was great - the cheese platter was definitely very enlightening.  They had some light cheeses there to suit the majority's palate.  The creme caramel...well, I really dislike any creme brulee and creme caramel so I didn't actually touch that at all.  \n\nOverall, I think the fantastic service was a determining factor that I'd definitely go back again.

I like the atmosphere and decorations - everything looks beautiful! The food is amazing, they have the best beef tartare in the city.

On the phone, I was told there would be four stations with four types of oysters, from both east and west coasts.  It sounded like a casual event where you would pay at the stations, get your oysters, have a few drinks and sample some of the new \"bits\".  It sounded like a fun launch!\n\nThis was not the case, by any means.  \n\n1. There was only one type of oyster (Cascumpec Bay, P.E.I.).  That in itself was a disappointment. \n\n2. We sampled some extremely watered down cocktails and some really strong ones too.  The inconsistency was terrible.  Some would say I can't complain about complimentary drinks, but if that's any indication of what you'll be serving me when I pay, then I thank you.\n\n3. I asked a server what was in a particular drink and she had no idea.  She said she would find out but she didn't.  This is a so-called \"launch\".  Shouldn't all the servers know the menu inside and out?\n\n4. We sampled a few food items but it seemed as though the food would go one way and the drinks the other.  There was no balance.  Some patrons would get all the food, we happened to get most of the drinks.

First things first, I am Taiwanese, born and raised, so I have definitely had these dishes in Taiwan before. My standards for these dishes weren't high since Charidise is obviously in Toronto, not Taiwan, and I don't think it's really going for \"authentic.\" Charidise is laid out as more of a \"cafe-style\" food (the concept of \u7c21\u9910 in Taiwan).

The steamed dumplings are especially delicious (har gow, shrimps with spinach, scallops, etc.). My favourite dumpling here is the shrimps with scallops - the dumpling wrapper is thinner and more chewy, and the inside contains a lot of shrimps & scallops (very juicy and plump).\n\nThe bok choy with garlic is crisp and fresh without being overly saucy. The fried eggplant stuffed with shrimps is another favourite. You can also order items from the regular menu (usually larger-sized dishes) at any time of the day.\n\nService is better compared to other dim sum places in Chinatown, and the atmosphere is nice yet still casual. Food comes out lightning fast (the first 2 dishes came out almost instantly after we handed our paper order in, and the other dishes came out minutes after).\n\n5 stars in all categories (food quality, taste, service, cleanliness, view, ambience) - one of the best dim sum places in Toronto.", 5], ["Had dinner here a couple of times while in Toronto.

View by the window of the water - watch the boats come and go...can also see the CN Tower depending where you are seated.\n\nOverall prices are bit high but guess it's based on location. Tried several different dishes: crispy skin chicken, sizzling beef, beef chow mein, baby bok choy, deep fried squid (was good best the 1st time...if you don't want it spicy, better make sure you tell them), yang chow fried rice and pineapple fried rice. Tea was good. \n\nDessert: Almond pudding was good. \n\nRestrooms - the ladies restroom - floors are slippery (tile floors not recommended esp when it rains or snows), heated toilet seats with the plastic cover (wave your hand to move it - like the casinos)", 4], ["We've gone here for weekend dim sum, weekday lunch and random dinners and each time it's never disappointed.\n\nJust to get it out of the way: yes, the price point for dim sum is slightly higher, but you do get what you pay for - pretty damn good food.  \n\nOn their regular menu they have a \"Pearl Specialties\" section.  I recommend the deep fried spicy lobster and sizzling lamb - really good!!\n\nWe've always had great service. \n\nMake reservations, it can get busy!", 5], ["I visited this place on a weekday for my lunch. The place is situated on the 1st floor of 207 Queens Quay West and has a really amazing view of the lake. The place has a really good ambience and serves the Chinese cuisine. Apart from the regular menu, they have Lunch Specials as well.\n\nI went on to try their Spicy Eggplant dish. It was served with rice and a crispy spring roll. Although the dish wasn't spicy to my taste palate (as being an Indian, I am used to much spicier food), but it tasted quite good. Also, I loved the fact that they made a special vegetarian roll for me because I couldn't have their usual one which is given as part of lunch specials. So, I would say the service was really great. Overall, it was quite a good experience.", 4], ["I would recommend this restaurant if you are showing friends or relatives from out of town or on special occasions since it has a great view of the lake.

We ordered most of the classic ones like Siu Mai, Wanton noodle soup, pork dumplings, fried calamari, crispy spring rolls and mango pudding, egg custard tart for dessert. Everything came faster than the speed of light!\n\nIt was a beautiful lunch altogether with a great view to enjoy. The staff are genuinely helpful and I am definitely come back to eat here again.", 4], ["Oh boy this place has seen an overhaul. I recall this being an ok spot to get my dim sum fix downtown. Then when I got exposure to the great places in suburbs and a fav haunt in downtown I just stopped visiting here.

The green beans and shrimp dish were above average as well. The chicken dishes were from ok to food court level (honey chicken something).

The only draw back is parking is not in same building and no validation so plan extra time if you are meeting people.", 5], ["For the price they are charging, I don't find this restaurant better in particular. The dim sum and noodles we ordered is very average tasting. You'll find better quality in Markham for a more affordable pricing. This place is almost 2-3X the price of any other dim sum restaurant. And I also find their dim sum menu options were quite limited, with no signature items. \n\nYou are also not guaranteed a table by the window that can look out to the waterfront, and the service was very mediocre.", 3], ["Dim sum wise: Authentic, delicious and various options here! Highly recommend! Get some tea with any dim sum would be ideal. And I will come back soon! \n\nView: near the lake, very decent and pretty view. \n\nPrice: Very reasonable.

That should've been a sign to tell us, it's not catering to real dim sum eaters. \n\nAnyway, we had the usual suspects and only 2 items stood out (1) Shrimp & Scallop dumplings and (2) salted egg yolk buns.  The scallop tasted fresh and added extra to an otherwise boring shrimp dumplings.  The salted egg yolk buns was delicious!

Both were solid choices though I did enjoy the dumpling more as it was nice and juicy with a big piece of shrimp on top.\nWe also ordered the Phoenix nest and sauteed duck breast with ginger and pineapple. Presentation for both dishes was great and the taste was pretty good as well. It did not blow me away but it was good nonetheless.\n\nThe service was alright. I cannot think of anything negative nor memorable about it so it was fine.\n\nThe best part of the restaurant is the view which is looking directly at the lake.

The only other thing was the Peking duck tacos or whatever they were, they really skimped on the \"duck\" several of us literally got well cooked tasty skin. is that common? I have no basis for comparison, if that's what Peking duck is thennnn it was great, if there was supposed to be some meat attached to that skin thennnnnn I would say negative 1 cool point.\n\nAs I said earlier, I don't know that I shall return here on my own steam, but if someone organizes something or its a spot for a meeting then I could see myself dining here.", 3], ["oh my gosh...best dim sum ever had.

Sorry....I digressed again)\n\nThe crispy beef was delicious was well and had the right amount of ginger to give the sweet sauce on the crispy beef a kick.\n\nThe chili chicken was good, but I expected more heat from the chili chicken. The chicken is also fried before it's tossed in the gravy. The chili chicken gravy goes well with the fried rice. \n\nNone of these dishes were very spicy. Having said that, both my friend and I can take heat. The portions are generous and my friend and I split the leftovers to pack as lunch the next day. I think the total came to less than 40 dollars which is great value in my opinion. I will definitely be back to sample the other pakoras!", 5], ["We came in on May 19,2019 at 12:45pm. The food quality isn't there anymore. I used to like this place. The food is very much lacking in flavour and doesn't have any taste. Their servings also aren't generous. I don't think I'll be going back however, I'd like to emphasize they're nice and friendly and has good customer service.", 3], ["Food is really good!! Went there to eat a couple of months ago...did have to wait a long time for the food like 45 mins (they were backed up) but it was worth it. When the food finally came my husband and I were amazed! Delicious! Chili chicken was fantastic! Overall the food was really really good!! \nJust had it the other day but did take out this time. Food was ready in half hour for pick up =) and again everything was delicious!  Can't wait to have their food again. Oh and it's a halal restaurant for those who eat halal. \n\nNot good for takeout!!\nI did take out and I have to say it wasn't good. Felt like I was eating old food. It didn't taste fresh at all. The crispness of the meat felt extremely hard and rubbery. Not impressed. And they made mistakes in my 4 dish order. My vegetarian dishes all had meat in them!", 4], ["So sorry to say that since the the owners changed (about 10 days ago) this restaurant has gone drastically downhill.  None of the items are the same as the previous owners recipes. Everything was over salty. Very low grade meat with too much batter. Nothing was even remotely spicy. Will never go back to this place. So disappointing.", 1], ["Just finished a great dinner.  Eat here if you like spicy. The place is very casual and does not appear too clean but that should  be overlooked.  The crispy beef is a must.  Very flavorful.  Ginger chicken was spicy with a huge amount of ginger, yummy. Manchurian chicken Chow Mein was very good, if again, you like spicy.  The stir fried veggies were not good as the cook used too much soy sauce (overly salty). We took home more then half the food.  A enjoyable dinner for another night.", 5], ["As of this writing (21 Oct 2018), I can confirm this place is garbage. Food is garbage, service is garbage, and the prices aren't reasonable AT ALL. I honestly can't think of a reason to give it 2 stars, and it's really not that hard. \n\nI'm not exaggerating here, the reviews here must've been when the owners actually cared, but it could be new management now or change in attitude. Regardless, I wouldn't go here, and forget about the \"halal\" servings here, the owner doesn't speak English and showed me this really sketchy letter from Mister Greek \"proving\" his claim that halal offerings are served here, but this doesn't say anything about the preparation in the back or whether he's really using the meat or not.", 1], ["I had the privilege of having their red soya noodle before the owners sold their business. \n\nOne of the hidden Hakka places that served some very authentic Indian Hakka food.

My friend and I were looking for late night food in the area and this restaurant was open until 11pm. \n\nWe ordered vegetarian chow mein and honey crispy chicken. We asked the server if the honey crispy chicken was spicy or not. She said it's not. When the food arrived, turns out it was slightly spicy (but I couldn't eat any spicy food at all). While the chow mein tasted great, the spicy chicken was the deal breaker. I also want to point out that the colour of honey crispy chicken dish was really dark (almost like black) and not very appetizing. There's a nice big glass of water to cool down the heat, but don't expect them to refill your glass of water.", 3], ["Came here for years with my dad with the old owners, at some points we were ordering from here 3-4 times a week.

I was having a lazy night and got the veggie pakora and the hakka shrimp noodles for takeout. \nNot going to lie. I ate 4 pakora on the way home... so tasty. Literally so good. The hakka noodles were very good too. The pakora stole the show because they were crunchy and tasty with a little spice. \nVery large portions and a very cute clean space. \nAll the positive reviews are true and I would definitely suggest visiting. I will likely be back for this crispy beef that everyone is raving over... beef is rarely my first choice at Chinese but they did so well on all the other dishes that I'm actually excited to try it.", 5], ["Just ordered the Thai soup and chili chicken for take-out.  You should specify on the \"daily or weekend special\" because I was charged their regular menu for the chili chicken.  I personally prefer the crispy beef (had this when I dined in) over the chili chicken.  I also prefer the Thai soup over the hot and sour soup since it was more flavourful.  I dined in once (last month) and their atmosphere is very casual.  I don't eat Hakka food often so can't compare it to another place.  Their daily/weekend special is worth your bucks.", 3], ["I've eaten here or picked up from here often. \n\nA friend introduced me to the restaurant.  She's been friends with the owners for years.  I would never have entered otherwise.

I had their Hot and Sour soup, Crispy Beef, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Fish, and Thai Fried Rice. Other than the soup which was good and the fish which was adequate the rest were not even close to some of the other Hakka restaurants out there like Spadina Garden or Faley that leave you feeling satisfied and pleased after most any dish you order. The rice was almost inedible and most everything seemed like it had been sitting out for a day before they used it to make the food. Quite stale.\nI wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy.", 1], ["Most pathetic and disgusting customer service, not only gave me a wrong order, but also denied to pay back and the server she was yelling on top of her voice.

The signature items are must try.", 5], ["Disclaimer: Nine years in Toronto and I've never eaten Chinese food in Chinatown. I've also never tried Hakka style Chinese food before. \nThat being said, this is the best Chinese food I've had in this country. The Hot and Sour Soup is the best I've EVER had. Manchurian Egg Fried Rice was delicious. First time trying Crispy Beef and it was also delicious. They made a mistake with my American Vegetable Chop Suey and gave me chicken and shrimp instead of veggie, but it was still really good, I just picked out the shrimps. The General Tao chicken was a bit gristly and should have been spicier, but had good flavor. \nThe young man who took my order and served my takeout bags was beyond sweet, and the restaurant itself was very clean and smelled good. \nAs someone else said, don't be put off by the crazy neighborhood (someone was outside in the street screaming about \"get off my street!\"), the food more than made up for it. I'm moving more central, but will definitely make the trip out now and then to try other items.", 4], ["Food was fresh, hot and spicy.  Each dish was unique and delicious. So much variety.

Wow!  this place is great!  The food was so fresh and flavourful,  very yummy.   The staff was awesome, friendly and helpful - which was a bonus since we really didn't know what to order.   Do not let the exterior dissuade you!  The food is genuinely fresh, fresh, fresh!     We had the hot and sour soup, the Manchurian Vegetable balls, the Manchurian Chow Mein, Crispy beef, Chili Chicken, and the Szechuan eggplant.   Each dish was better than the last!

Can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow!!", 5], ["If you love Hakka there's no better spot than this..We get take out here at least once a week and everything we've tried is delicious..quality fresh ingredients and so full of flavour.

We couldn't be happier we've discovered this place..all thanks to the reviews below.", 5], ["This place has by far the best customer service of any chinese restaurant in Toronto.

All 7 out of 7 of us polished our plates until it was shiny clean.\n\nI ordered the tamales with mole chicken, with rice and beans. It came with a side of salsa, which I had refilled. BEST RICE AND BEANS I'VE EVER HAD!!! Want to cry just thinking about it. It was a revelation. And the tamales were very aromatic. The salsa was just the perfect kick to tie it all together.\n\nBasically the best Mexican food I've ever had in Toronto.", 5], ["Important !!!! The menu on Yelp is NOT up to date. The prices have changed significantly (I've attached the latest menu). \n\nWas a tad bit slow to get started (host was talking to a couple eating, when we went to go get a menu ourselves the host told us to wait and he would bring us a menu, but then proceeded to talk to continue talking to the couple for a little bit). Asides from this, service was very good and the host was very generous.\n\nI proceeded to purchase the chicken mole which was very good. The sauce was definitely the best part, it wasn't necessarily sweet or salty, it was just good. This was accompanied by some dark meat chicken which was very tender as well - not so much seasoned but the sauce was enough. The rice and beans were solid as well. Would definitely come here again next time I'm in Toronto", 4], ["Rating: 3/5\n\nSummary: \nWe believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.\n\nThe dishes we tried: \n- burrito w/ verde sauce\n- fish tacos\n- chicken enchiladas\n- chicken mole\n- guac/salsa w/ chips\n- mains circa $12-15\n- appetizers circa $6-8\n\nFood:\nOne of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.\n\nHowever, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.\n\nOn a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.\n\nConclusion: \nGoogle reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.\n\nFor more quality pictures and honest reviews, follow us on Instagram @pchan_and_sam_reviews.

All that being said, I will definitely be going back!", 4], ["Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a \"large chicken burrito\" which cost 14$.

It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality.

The cashier and perhaps owner or family member of the owner, like to point out the picture version of the menu to the right of the door as you enter. Portions sizes are large enough to give you your fill for lunch. \n\nI got the fish tacos. Well fried with a well seasons fish, which is sweet and moist. There is like a coleslaw that tops it along with pickled onion slices. All of this along with hot sauces creates this lovely mix of salty, umami, sweet, sour, and spicy. What a delight. This is all held together by two 6\" corn tortilla, which in my opinion is a little small for the size of the fish. \n\nThe Jamaica is made from hibiscus and is sweet, earthy, and tart and is a lovely refreshing beverage for nice summer day. \n\nThe one critique is the price but I mean prices are just generally higher everywhere no a days. But the price combined with the small space that forces intimacy between strangers keep this space from being a full 5 stars.

Upon walking in the menu is on a giant poster to your right and it lists out a couple options (no more than 20) and you order and pay at the counter before getting served. As soon as I walked in one of the staff immediately greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I don't usually comment on service, but the service I revived from multiple staff at Como En Casa was absolutely amazing and therefore noteworthy.\n\nI got the enchiladas ($13), which came with rice and beans as well. The chicken enchiladas came in threes with the mole sauce surrounding it, a white sauce drizzled on top of it and some lettuce and a type of cheese stacked on top if it as well. The chicken inside was very soft and overall the enchiladas were delicious. The mole added a nice kick to it as well. The rice was well-seasoned and very tasty and I could've easily downed a couple more servings of it. I'm not usually a bean guy, but the beans were prepared very well here as well. They were mashed to a thick-ish consistency and the taste of the beans was not overwhelming, which I usually find at other restaurants. The meal also came with a homemade mild-hot sauce which was also very good. I think my only complaint is that the portions could've been a bit larger (at least for the rice and beans, which are pretty cheap). However, the meal was good enough to make it worth the price anyways. \n\nI'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.", 5], ["$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me.

The guacamole here is also AMAZING (sweet and citrusy) as well as the refried beans (very soft in texture, topped with feta cheese).

I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me \"if guacamole was okay\". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. \n\nAll of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito.

I think the machine was a little funky spitting out some yogurt dance but it still looked presentable. deKEFIR is definitely a much more expensive option (snack size was ~$6 with one topping) compared to other ice cream and frozen yogurt places but still worth a try.", 3], ["I have mixed feelings about deKEFIR. I like that it is a healthy alternative to ice cream. I did not feel guilty after having it. But on the other hand, it did not satisfy my ice cream cravings.

They are very, veryyy generous with their toppings. The price is also quite low for the amount of ice cream you get. I liked their roasted walnuts and dark chocolate bits. Not a big fan of crackle bits. I think it's good to go with some sort of fruit on the side as well (the lady who worked there warned me about this but I didn't listen :P  ).

It tasted slightly different from regular froyo - more refreshing and light. I ended up getting the crakle bit for the topping. It was sooooo good.

I can't even pronounce you properly, but I've been waiting patiently for the day to finally try and review you :) \n\nCame this afternoon around 3PM to try their famous frozen kefir at last. Traffic was light and there were 2 tables left with outlets nearby (good study spot!). The location is kind of tucked away within the PATH, in the Bay Adelaide Center right in front of the escalators from the KPMG bldg after you descend. I've never had kefir before, but love frozen yogurt/ice cream/etc, so had amazing expectations. Important reminder: Take Lactaid if you are lactose intolerant because it will trigger a gut reaction otherwise!\n\nI tried samples of both their frozen and fresh yogurts before deciding on the frozen version. The frozen version is more of a treat since it is sweetened with cane sugar. The fresh version tastes exactly like runny plain yogurt (= sour) since it is unsweetened, so if you do decide to get a healthier kefir parfait or smoothie, do ask for some honey as well if you can't stand non-sweetened yogurt.  \n\nThe service was great! The girl at the counter was so helpful and patient with me as she educated me on kefir and showed me the store options. But I could give only 3 stars because tbh I was not at all impressed with the taste, presentation, or value of the options. There are 4 size options for the frozen kefir and I got the small, which was plenty for a snack. For an extra $1 you can choose 4 toppings instead of just 1, so I chose papaya, strawberries, dark chocolate, and puffed quinoa. Other popular options included candied walnuts and crackle bits, which are basically finely smashed cookie bits. I felt like they were too light on the toppings, which were arguably the best part since the yogurt itself tasted kind of... boring. I DO NOT recommend the quinoa. I think I was expecting regular cooked quinoa because I was so disappointed to find the bits hollow, crispy, and flavorless. \n\nYou can also order gut-healthy smoothies here, which is what my partner got (fresh kefir + honey + strawberries + mixed fruit + 1 small piece of beet + kale). It tasted like a regular juice that I could have made at home with a Magic Bullet.\n\nTogether we spent around $13, which is not bad, but I think next time I'd rather go to Grk Ygrt in Kensington Market for their way yummier (but less healthy) and equal value frozen yogurts.", 3], ["Came to try their kefir for free on their birthday.

Just how I like it. I don't like normal fro-yo because I find it too sweet & processed. This was right up my alley! Full of probiotics.\n\nI went with berries, tropical fruit, an interesting quinoa granola-type topping, toasted coconut shavings, and a really tasty walnut topping that's hard to describe.

There's no definitive evidence but there's speculation that the probiotic bacterial strains within kefir can withstand the acidity of the stomach and reach your small intestine.  The consensus seems to be that you should eat kefir if you like it, and you may or may not experience the benefits of the probiotics, but it doesn't hurt to try.\n\nAnyways, I visited deKEFIR during the afternoon and it was moderately busy.  The servers were really nice and helpful with their suggestions with regards to the toppings.  I decided to go with Crackle Bits, Walnuts, Toasted Quinoa, and Pineapple.\n\nThe frozen kefir itself is an acquired taste - it tastes heavily of dairy.  At first, it's a weird taste, but I ended up enjoying it as I got used to it.  The toppings were great and added different textures and flavours to the snack.

I went for peach (since it is peach season now) to try and replicate create my own version of a 'froyo peach cobbler'. \nThey definitely don't skimp on the toppings either! The peach chunks and crackling bits are generously placed on the bottom first and then lined on the sides of the kefir yogurt to make sure they are present in each bite! \n\nThe frozen kefir tart, and a bit more on the icier side in texture rather than being creamy.

This is probably the newest tower on the PATH so many people are not as familiar with it.

No visit it complete without a goofy photo in front of the Toronto letters!!", 5], ["Nathan Phillips Square is one of the most recognized landmarks of Toronto aside from CN Towers.\n\nLarge open area great for communities events and celebrations: New Year Countdown, Canada Days, Cultural Days, Weekly Farmer's Market, Art Events and Carnivals etc.\n\nLove the Christmas lights and winter skating during the holiday seasons probably a highlight of growing up in the City.\n\nWhy the 3 stars?\n\nIt is getting really dirty and smelly. Garbage, Bird Poop, Urine Smell really turned me off. I hope the City would have clean the area more frequently.", 3], ["Nathan Phillips Square is Toronto's core... well depending on who you talk to BUT it is where most Toronto celebrations or big events start or end.  \n\nIt has a few iconic and well known snaps that everyone in the world can recognize.  The big TORONTO sign... yes! it's there.  Tag your shot #Toronto and be like every other tourist!  Most people like to stand in the 'O' and have someone take a shot from the other side.  It is also back drop to our 'futuristic' city hall.  Most sci fiction movies or shows have used that building at one point in time.\n\nIn the summer, you'd have the events on the weekends but I'll admit that during the week day evenings... it's quiet. TOO quiet perhaps?  There's very very little going on.  Sure there's a reflection pool for you to sit nearby and maybe one food truck.  But it honestly feels deserted.\n\nNow during the winter, you've got some of the bigger draws which includes the Winter Christmas market leading up to Christmas (duh) and our really touristy but fun skating rink.  The reflection pool is frozen over and (semi) maintained for skating.  For $10, you can rent skates to skate in the heart of Toronto.  \n\nFor all those who are beginner skaters, don't worry... most people there are just skating for the first time too.  So you're not going to look out of place.  For all those who can skate or skate a bit, you're going to feel like you're on the Gardiner highway in the middle of rush hour.  IT IS CROWDED and with people just flailing or falling around, it is anxiety on ice.  #BeenThereDoneThatAndNeverAgain\n\nOverall, Toronto's centre does bring us together for those touristy and little memories but does it keep us coming back... perhaps not.", 3], ["Cute tourist spot to take pictures while visiting Toronto. The only drawback would be that there is limited bench seating in the shade.

Overall, still a very nice square.", 3], ["I still remember the first time i saw nathan philips square (i did NOT know it was outside the eaton centre) it is a great staple for toronto and it being infront of the town hall makes it an even better location.

However, great night and glad Toronto has this to offer.", 4], ["I love Toronto but what it lacks in the downtown core is open public spaces. Nathan Phillips Square at City Hall is the closest thing to what we have to a public square. \n\nIf you haven't been to NPS, it's a mishmash of characters: fast food vendors, city counselors, tourists, homeless people, and seagulls, to name a few. They all share the space. \n\nIn the summer, NPS becomes a popular retreat for those in nearby offices and for those visiting the city for the first time. When the sun gets too hot, many of us with fair complexions retreat underneath the overpass for the shade, while sun-lovers bask in the sun near the reflective pool and Freedom Arches. \n\nI'm super excited about the revitalization program. From what I've seen of the plans, you should see less grey and more green at NPS.\n\nA few things have changed: the Skate Pavilion is nearly completed and the Peace Garden has been dismantled but will be reconstructed elsewhere. But the most beautiful addition has been the Podium Roof Garden. You can walk up the ramp and you'll be transported to a place of serenity. It's a beautifully landscaped area with benches and walkways, and provides a great view of our cityscape.\n\nBeing in the centre of our city, special events are held all year round. During the week in the summer, the farmer's market is held on Wednesday which is very popular and spread across the square. There's also Tasty Thursday where you can sample a plethora of ethnic dishes.\n\nThe only downside about NPS is the growing avian population. Getting bombed by one of these birds is a regular occurrence, and the aggressive seagulls aren't shy to grab your fries as you leave the Blue Chip Truck. \n\nOther than that, it's a good meeting place and a good place to escape to for an hour or more.", 4], ["I like the square but it isn't one of my favourite places in the city.  The skating isn't as nice as Harbourfront (it feels a lot more repetitive and the space is colder) and it is large enough to feel impersonal when events are staged here.

Even if you live in the city, go. If you don't know how to skate, you'll learn. We complain about winter but when you're breathing in all the delicious winter air, you can't help loving that you live in Toronto. \n\nThey have tons of other great events here: New Year's Eve, concerts, charity events, speeches. It's located right near the Eaton's Centre, so there's always a ton of people there, not to mention the chip, burger and hot dog trucks that line its edge. \n\nVisit NPS if you're a tourist. You won't be disappointed.", 4], ["It's a true testament to the old when people can appreciate their city hall. Nathan Philips Square is not just the place where our city councilors do their 'thing\", but it's a gigantic public space open to everyone.  During the year, there are various events, concerts, shows and cavalcades and I've had a number of great experiences there.\n  \n  One of my fondest memories is skating on the Nathan Philips Square rink in the winter, which just opened this past week. At night, the rink is lit up with bright lights and music is always playing. The rink is open 24/7 so a fun adventure is to go at 3 am, strap on a pair of skates and listen to the not-so-quiet of Queen Street below you.\n\n Every summer the Square holds the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition where you can find all mediums of art on display for sale. The exhibition is as wide and vast as the square itself and it's a wonderful showcase of local Toronto artists, along with several travelers as well. It's a great way to spend a summery afternoon. \n\n  During the Nuit Blanche festivities that the city holds every year in the fall, Nathan Philips Square is a huge focal point. This past Nuit Blanche, the two buildings facing each other were lit up like a giant pong game. Crowds of people were singing and laughing as they sat and walked around the Square...\n\n    I've been there for free outdoor concerts and shows, and pass the Square on a weekly basis on trips to the downtown core. When I first saw Nathan Philips Square and city hall I thought the concrete wasn't very warm or welcoming; it looked dark and felt cold. I still think they could use more plants and seating, but the Square has definitely grown on me over the years, especially due to all the events I've been to. \n\n  If you live in Toronto, take advantage of the free outdoor events Nathan Philips Square holds. If you are a visitor, it may not be so pretty, but the Square is a great place to visit, especially in the summer during a night concert!", 4], ["I just visited Toronto for two days, and there was an event here each day. First there was Mexico in Toronto. Then Manifesto, a great rap and culture festival.\n\nThere's a beautiful fountain, a peace garden, food, city hall, and more. Only missing free wifi. You have to go to Timothy's World Coffee across the street for that.", 4], ["There are tons of neat things that happen in Nathan Phillips Sqaure, and if I'm nearby I will usually duck over to grab some fries from a chip wagon and see if anything neat is going on.  I've stumbled onto a few interesting things like fireworks shows that way before.\n\nOverall though, I feel like the entire square is kind of a big square of concrete, which is why the proposed \"greening\" of the square would have been so cool.  I'm pretty sure I read that the funding may have been put on hold for that project, and it wouldn't surprise me that it did.  Like so many other things in the city, it'll do just fine.\n\nEvents to check out the square - winter fireworks, jazz festival, the outdoor art show and whatever they do during Nuit Blanche next year.", 3], ["I would say more like a 3.5. The skating rink is pretty small, needed to be zambonied BADLY when we got there so we thought an ice clean was due soon... nope.

They have music playing which makes for a good atmosphere, rentals (can't remember how much) and a small locker room.\nIt's definitely in a good area, a few minutes walking distance from the Eaton Center in the heart of the city.\n\nGoing to check out the rink at the Harbourfront for the first time tonight so we'll see how it measures up. High hopes!", 3], ["Other than the skating rink there is really nothing exciting to see here. It's usually full of workers for the city that work at city hall during the weekdays. The skating rink on the other hand is what people usually come here for. To use the rink, it's free! Who doesn't love that? If you don't own a pair of skates yourself, you can rent them for $10 (adult) and $5 (kids). It's nice to go there during the night because the \"ceiling\" of the rink lights up and is actually quite pretty. During the summer though, the rink becomes an outdoor fountain. All in all, Toronto's city hall building itself does need some maintenance. Perhaps some renovations and upgrades would be nice, seeing that the city hall building looks the same as a decade ago. Perhaps something new to set fireworks on would be nice for a change.", 3], ["Skating was great here.  Lots of people, beautiful setting in front of city hall(s) and nice to be in the centre of the city.  Rentals were $5 for kids, $10 for adults for 2 hours if you're just visiting like I was.

Sadly, for me, it was not. Maybe it was an off night, but we did not have the best time. Upon arrival, there was a line of about five waiting to get in. The front door man kept entering, coming back out, asking everyone in line if we knew anyone inside, are we VIP, and if this was our first time here. Everyone in line kinda kept looking at each other, because his behavior was bizarre. After a short wait, my partner and I were welcomed in. However right when we got inside, the bouncer asked again if we had been before, we said no, and then he demanded 10$ cover from each of us. We had no idea if this was customary, so of course we obeyed and gave him 20$ and then we entered. The space was small and very crowded. We squeezed our way to bar where we were greeted by the nicest bartender! Despite being overwhelmed, he was so nice and gave us a run down of the drinks and beer available. We knew upon entering we didn't want to stay long so we both just grabbed a beer. The crowd here made me feel like I was old (which is something I've never experienced before) so that was weird. Everyone appeared to be barely over the legal drinking age and seemed to know each other. Feeling a bit out of place and over being shoulder to shoulder with everyone else in the room, we finished our beers and left. \n\nCome to find out, when I described my experience to my friends who recommended Cold Tea, they have never paid cover at Cold Tea! Therefore we most likely just got taken advantage of by the sketchy bouncer who knew we were from out of town. I should have read the warning signs when he kept asking if I had been before/did I know anyone inside.

So many great indie shops that also has some unique cafes such as Balzac's and a lot of family owned bakeries that sell amazing sweets.\n\nThere's also a sake brewery, segway tours, a couple of Mill Street bars and some other restaurants.  Actually, I don't really recommend any of the restaurants as I find them overpriced and lacking in portion size, but given this is a tourist attraction, I guess that's expected.  \n\nIt's a great place to show tourists around and I love the brick on the floor, but wouldn't say it's an everyday place for shopping.  \n\nLast time I visited, there was also a holiday market and the overall atmosphere was amazing.  \n\nFinal verdict: Good for a special day, bringing tourists around, but not an everyday spot.", 4], ["One of my favourite places in Toronto, especially in the summer.

Great restaurant with an awesome atmosphere.", 5], ["Updating my review as we revisited. \nWe sat next to the table Edward Blake wrote the first prospectus on, apparently. The front foldout of the menu has a bio of the founding owner Edward Blake, so I studied the menu intently. Unfortunately this is where all the cool history anecdotes end and the food is just mediocre pub fare. While the inside of the house has a thirties ambience, the menu could not be more sports dad. Sandwiches, salads, finger foods. Our double date decided that we would have the chicken wings and nachos for starters. The melted cheese and chili were served over kettle chips which was a pleasant surprise. The wings were alright and probably the highlight of the meal for being not overly breaded yet still crispy. They were spiced enough to not require the honey garlic or hot dip we paired it with. \nOur mains were all super greasy and bland. I had ordered the stout beef pie and it tasted like frozen vegetables had been stewed with powder gravy, swimming with gnarled pieces of tendonous minced beef cutoffs. It was served with a blob of mashed potato that resembled a D cup boob. I don't know why I'm making that comparison--it's convenient and was shaped that way?\n\nI had no problems with the service however. The waiters were attentive and fast.\n----\nFirst visit: went here with my partner and his colleague, who had gotten a promotion at Blakes (lol). We had reservations and waited for half an hour, the host had sat other parties of 4 and whenever he walked by, seem to utter something incomprehensible and brush past us. We didn't protest, but the waiter seemed to make excuses about the other parties he sat without reservations.

The meat was fall off the bone and it comes with a side of mashed potatoes. You can never go wrong with mashed potatoes. As for dessert, the carrot cake and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e are definitely my top choices. Their dessert err on the sweet side, but I'm a sugar fiend so I didn't mind. \n\nIt's a nice rustic setting to get together with friends or to bring a date.

Of course my physician probably thinks my cholesterol count includes a comma now, but hey, it was worth it.", 5], ["Very friendly staff, great service, pleasant atmosphere. I had the chicken supreme.

Ate outside on a rather nice patio, which even has booths. My dinner companion and I sat at a table for two by the sidewalk.\n\nWe both ordered a dirty Gin martini with three olives (per the drink menu). It arrived cold, but not cold enough, and was mostly olive brine and only had two olives. We should have sent them back. About 15 minutes later, our server arrived to take our food order. We both opted for their burger, mine topped with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and Greek salad on the side and his with cheese and fries on the side.\n\n45 minutes later, and after no offers of another drink, our food arrived. The burgers were overly charred (basically black) and overdone, mine without the mushrooms which, when arrived a few minutes after pointing it out, were cold and flavourless. The Greek salad was far from being Greek. It consisted of some kind of leaf lettuce or spring mix (honestly, if you must put lettuce in a Greek salad, use a crunchy romaine), way too much salty feta cheese, a few small pieces of mealy tomatoes and cucumber and no olives whatsoever. The little bit of dressing was bland. The fries were good, as were the brioche buns. The small dill pickle quarter was rather unremarkable and commercial.\n\nBy the time we finished our dinner, it was dark out. The lighting on the patio was almost nonexistent. Late diners were arriving and had to use their cell phone flashlights to read the menu.\n\nWe then waited 20 minutes for our cheque. At any point, we could've just walked out.\n\nAt many points, we could've complained, but because of another commitment after dinner, we didn't have the time it would take to deal with having food and drinks replaced. Besides, our server never asked how everything was. \n\nThere's a large tree in the middle of the side of the patio we were on. Filling it with lights would make the world of difference. Eating dinner and paying for it in the dark is a real challenge, and navigating down the stairs to the sidewalk could be treacherous for those with limited night vision. The stairway lighting along the stairs is far too subtle.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick and satisfying drink and dinner on a lovely patio with a comfortable atmosphere and timely service (our server was indeed quite pleasant, though), this isn't really a place that you could rely on. It seemed that there were staff shortages both on the floor and in the kitchen. It's a shame, really, because the old mansion has an interesting history and the outside dining area could be quite lovely if more thought was put into it the overall ambience. Service and atmosphere aside, if an establishment can't do a burger right, I would hesitate to order a steak. \n\nDisclaimer: I did not venture into the interior of the restaurant, so my comments apply to our outside dining adventure only. After all, it's summertime, and most Canadians would prefer to eat outside when given the choice!", 2], ["Absolutely beautiful restaurant and great food. This was the first restaurant my friend and I went to when we visited the city. \n\nI ordered the chicken pot pie and tried the Blake's Splash, which is Passion fruit alize, vodka and 7up.

When they brought me another one, it was cooked well but the rub was salty to the point of being inedible. I had to cut the top part off to be able to eat my meal. \n\nI ordered the chocolate sundae for dessert because after an unappetising meal, I thought there was no way a chocolate dessert could go wrong. I was wrong. The only semblance of chocolate the sundae had was some chocolate syrup which tasted store bought. It was my fault for not reading the description of the \"Chocolate Sundae\" properly but I never imagined I'd have to look for the chocolate in a dessert which has \"Chocolate\" in it's name. Perhaps the restaurant can work on naming this dish to something more appropriate, like \"Vanilla Sundae\".\n\nThe service was great, no complaints there.", 2], ["Had a gift certificate to The Blake House and chose to use it for brunch.

I got the lemon and blueberry pancakes, and being a lover of pancakes, I was relieved to see a golden crust and moist middle.

They had a nice local cider that was sweet but not overpowering. I did not want a heavy meal so I order the charcuterie platter.

It was impossible that you could get a burger this good anywhere else. How were people not storming in demanding $12 gourmet burgers?

But the plus for me this time my party ordered the steak fried rice, imagine my surprise when the rice had actual strips of steak in it. But the succulent pork is an amazing cut, it compliments the short ribs and rice very well. This is definitely a good place to go on a first date or any outing that you want to talk to your dining partner. This place is intimate but still really good for larger groups.

We also ordered 2 pitchers of ice water and lime soda to keep us hydrated. \n\nThis came with the usual little dishes of bean sprouts, kimchee, daikon radish, celery and soy sauce and sesame seeds for dipping. They are now also offering top your own waffles as a dessert offering. However we 3 ladies stuffed ourselves so much on grilled meats that we didn't have room for dessert.  It was a good choice for a Good Friday dinner when many of the restaurants and cafes had closed early for the holiday.", 4], ["Came here with my friend, was staying downtown and just wanted some good Korean food. The meats are very well marinated, and wasn't overly seasoned which is a big plus.

The employees are very kind and are always looking out to see if anyone needs help. The food was delicious and was very sanitary.", 5], ["So delicious!

Nothing says community like cooking raw meats together over a grill built right into the table! You can tell its a communal thing as the noise level is above average, but thats just because everyone is having fun.\n\nThis is not my first time at Korean BBQ, but Korean Grill House added a few extra things that has put it above the rest in my KBBQ experiences. The chicken was actually flavoured very well, along with the pork. The beef was good, but a tad salty, but combined with fresh lettuce and rice, really breaks up the saltiness (and monotony of meat)\n\nItems of interest were the salmon fillets, which grill up nicely, and ox tongue and liver (tried the tongue, not the liver). We purchased the regular all you can eat (about $16), and the veg option ($3) - decided to pass on the shrimp and lamb option (about $18, includes everything from the $16 option).\n\nWait staff was very friendly and quick to respond, and would replace your grill top upon request (which is essential after an hour of eating). The best part of all, no charge for any leftovers! For an AYCE place that also does a la carte, this was a big surprise (a much welcomed one as well).\n\nOne last tip, bring friends, lots of friends, for a good time and good food.", 4], ["Came with a friend on a busy Sat night and we were seated right away. The meat were all well seasoned and came out faster than I expected. Some of the pork had more fat than I wanted but once grilled, everything tasted great.

I liked the grilling experience\nStaff were nice and my water was constantly refilled", 4], ["The concept here is great. However, the meat is more like fat with bits of meat on it.

(which would normally cook in less than 30 seconds) I brought this to the waiter's attention and he said that the heat can't go any higher.\n\nOkay. I accepted it. But after an hour, I ate approximately two pieces of meat because that's how long the meat took to cook on our barely lit grill. I was starving so I asked the waiter again if we could move to another grill.

For the two of us with bubble tea and a coke, it came to $30. Very reasonable!\n\nThe service is less than amazing, the servers are busy with all of the tables and didn't stop by often.

They give really small portions at a time, so it's really annoying to keep having to fill out the slip.\nCustomer service wasn't all that great either. Yes, it might have been busy but we asked them to change our grill, and they never did. The waiter also gave us dirty looks for giving them more slips. It's AYCE, what do you expect us to do?

They gave use some free snacks which was really nice & the servers kept coming back to ask us if we needed anything (they didn't forget us after all). The bill was kinda all over the place & were only allowed to split it 4 ways. Which was understandable since our party was so large.

Not sure how healthy that is, but let's just say my thigh gap was slowly shrinking and I was not minding at all.\n\nThe sides that you get are refreshing and I have them in between bites of chicken. However, the compromise that my husband and I have come to is the half-half. It's best for those who have differing tastes or that want variety and also it's amazing value! It's perfect for 2-3 people.\n\nWhile I am not the biggest fan of the seasoned spicy, it is definitely popular amongst my friends and family. There is a warm flavour that's either from cinnamon or all spice which I am not fond of but others rave about. I personally lean more towards the gold cheese.

The sauce kinda tastes like a combination of dijon mustard and soy sauce.\n2) Half-half of cheese fried chicken and spicy fried chicken - the spicy one was a very generic Korean gochujang red sauce while the cheese was melted shredded cheddar.\n3) Seafood pancake - average portion size and lots of vegetable/onion filling but close to zero pieces of seafood (I would not recommend this dish!)", 4], ["So we know its a fact that Korean Fried Chicken(KFC) is the best fried chicken(fight me) and Mymy is a good representation of how KFC tastes like. I would know because I took a detour through Seoul just so I could eat authentic KFC.\n\nFood:\n\nIn term of sauces, they do it pretty much the same way it's done in South Korea, but they can improve on the crispiness of the chicken a bit. Their portion size is very generous, much more than other KFC places in the area, one Full chicken is good enough for 2 people.\n\nSauces:\n\nSeasoned Spicy is pretty much the signature KFC sauce, the name says it's spicy but its more on sweet side. If you want to get Spicy chicken try their Red Hot boiled chicken, which is also sweet and spicy but more spicy than sweet lol, also it's not boiled, not sure why it's called that.

Besides just fried chicken, they also have other a la carte options like fried chicken intestines, seafood pancake, kimchi tofu, toppoki, seafood noodles, and more.  They have tons of beer selection too for the ultimate 'fried chicken and beer' night.\n\nThey serve the chicken either with bones or boneless (extra $2).  There is also an option to get a whole chicken with two flavours called \"Half-Half\", which would have been a great option had we wanted the pre-specified flavours of \"Original,\" \"Seasoned Spicy,\" \"Gold Cheese,\" or \"Onion\".\n\nFor the three of us, we ordered two whole chickens:  Gold Cheese and Honey & Garlic.  We asked for the Gold Cheese Chicken to be boneless while the Honey & Garlic to have the bones intact.\n\nAfter placing our order (the tables have electronic bells on them for you to get the attention of a server), we received three types of banchan: freshly popped popcorn, pickled radish, and another julienne pink pickled radish.\n\nOur fried chicken arrived in a decent amount of time and looked amazing!  The Gold Cheese Chicken smelled so good.  There weren't any cheese powder on it contrary to what the menu had said and also contrary to Wendy's experience when she had had it on a previous visit.  There were so many nuggets of chicken in the bowl!  Bits of shredded cheddar cheese covered the crispy fried chicken.\n\nTaste-wise, the meat inside the chicken wasn't very seasoned.  It really relied on the batter and exterior cheddar cheese to give it some flavour.\n\nThe Honey & Garlic Fried Chicken was another beautiful batch with some assorted rice cakes and sweet potatoes on the top of it too.  While I'm not a huge fan of sweet flavoured meat, I liked this because it was with bones and thus the dark meat was much more tender and juicy.\n\nI really enjoyed the visit here at MyMy Chicken.  It's the perfect place for a group hangout.  The more people you have, the more flavours of fried chicken you can try out.  The service was great as well.\n\nNext time, I'd order only the chicken with bone and take advantage of the Half-Half \"2 flavours/1 chicken\" deal.

The half-half option basically allows you to have a whole chicken split into two flavours (but only original, gold cheese, seasoned spicy, or onion). I do have to say that the \"seasoned spicy sauce\" is more sweet than spicy but I don't really mind. The chicken is always super tender and juicy, and the crispy skin just ties it up perfectly.

This place can get full so be sure to plan accordingly, especially during Friday/Saturdays\n\nTips/Closing comments\n- Order half/half and try different flavours\n- Try to get there early on busy nights (Thurs/Fri/Sat)\n- If you're a fried chicken lover don't think twice about trying this place", 5], ["Rating: 5/5\nAesthetics: 3.5/5\nFood: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nRecommendation: Garlic & Soy Chicken (don't get fooled by the non-split option, this flavour is amazing and worth not being split) \n\nAs a bonus: Spicy Rice Cakes with dumplings and seaweed rolls!\n\nInsta tip: Get a lower angle looking up to the towering fried chicken then get the the glisten and sharpness of the crispyness that Mymy Chicken masterfully creates!\n\nOverall: An amazing fried chicken place to indulge and satisfy the greatest of cravings! Come with an appetite and then some because there is A LOT of chicken here! However, be prepared to wait because the hype sure is real for this new chicken joint around North York. Share different flavors and enjoy yourself!\n\nDrown yourself in some amazing fried chicken at this new restaurant! Their chicken has a perfect blend between crispy, moist, and flavorful. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in Toronto. We opted for the Garlic & Soy flavour and was not disappointed with the portions or the flavour. Although it wasn't available for a half-half basket option, it was better as a whole serving. \n\nThe spicy rice cakes are also a great side to having some fried chicken. The rice cakes have a little bit of a kick but alongside the seaweed rolls and dumplings, there is no better combination except for beer. Highly recommended!", 5], ["So I came to mymy chicken with my family while we're on vacation to Toronto. The chicken isn't bad but I've definitely had better Korean chicken for half the price. First of all I think the \"$$\" on the yelp page is kind of misleading. Most of the chicken there is around $24 and up and including tax and tip is clearly a \"$$$\".\nOne of the biggest issues I had with this place is how inflexible the menu is. Essentially you can't mix and match any of their unique flavors. You can't get a half serving of anything besides their basic flavors. So you have to pay for the full serving for the unique flavors and a lot of them range $25+ which is kind of ridiculous. \n\nI got their green onion fried chicken and my brother got their extreme spicy chicken. Their extreme spicy chicken is inedible. My brother can pretty much eat any spicy food you can imagine, but their spicy chicken had no real flavor. It was just spicy to the point where it didnt taste good. Their green onion fried chicken was good. I don't think I would pay around $28 for it again.  Again, I've had better Korean fried chicken for half the price and the same serving size.\n\nThe interior is pretty and trendy. The service was good as well. The servers were very nice!\n\nOverall, it was okay. I think paying almost $60 for \"meh\" fried chicken is not worth it.", 2], ["Pro: really juicy and flavorful chicken fried to perfection\nCon: unpredictable wait time\n\nMy friends and I decided to give this place a try after craving for real authentic Korean fried chicken for a while. Knowing this place was a chain from Korea, we had pretty high expectations. We ordered the yangnyeom chicken and honey butter garlic boneless chicken (the waitress recommended we get boneless and it was so worth the extra 2 bucks). \n\nThe yangnyeom was my personal favorite due to the savory and spicy kick of the tangy sauce. However, I have to say that it did taste a little Chinese as they added 5 spice powder. My Korean friend said that it didn't have that authentic taste she was looking for. Nevertheless, it was truly delicious and paired perfectly with the drinks we ordered.\n\nThe honey butter chicken came with rice cakes and sweet potato which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was extremely garlic-y so I wouldn't recommend if you don't want to smell like garlic afterwards. All of us actually quite enjoyed the mix of the sticky sweet honey and fragrant garlic. The waitress was right, boneless fits best with this flavor. \n\nDo give this place a try if you have time. The food is amazing and ambiance was great. However avoid rush hours as you will wait for a long time.", 4], ["I was in the area, came without expectation but left pleased. The chicken was great, crispy outside and juicy inside, not dry at all. I loved the $2 extra sweet and sour dipping sauce which was light and balanced. For me, their delicious pickles were hero of the show. Service was polite. This spot does deserve the hype!!", 5], ["Everyone left and right has been telling me to try Mymy Chicken. But my experience doesn't seem to match what others have experienced on this yelp page. Now it seems to me that the food quality is inconsistent. Our party ordered half/half flavours: Gold Cheese/Seasoned Spicy and Gold Cheese/Onion Chicken, Oden Soup, and Yam Fries.  The thing about the fried chicken is that some pieces are juicy but some pieces are VERY dry. The thighs and drumsticks are juicy but the other parts of the chicken are very dry. But it seemed like there were more parts that were dry than juicy, which was very concerning. The oden soup just tasted like pepper and that was it. The yam fries tasted how they should taste so I have no other comment about that.  They also gave us radish/sour cabbage/popcorn as side dishes. In terms of sides, I think the Fry is better but overall on average, the fried chicken is better than the Fry. However, I still think I rather eat Popeyes/KFC at this point for quality and value. \n\nOther things to note about this restaurant: \nThere is no reservation policy at this restaurant so if you want a table for sure, you have to come early. They also don't allow you to split bills so be prepared to pay on one card or to pay cash. \n\nAll in all, I think this place is overhyped and doesn't deserve such a high rating. Don't think I will be returning ever again.", 3], ["Closer to a 3.5. Tried the golden cheese and seasoned spicy fried chicken with bone in. We got takeout. The seasoned spicy is really good. Lots of flavour. The cheese one was good too but I preferred the seasoned spicy. I had also tried the original before and wasn't huge on that one. \n\nWe tried the spicy rice cakes too and didn't like it that much. The sauce was spicy but not that flavourful.", 3], ["A renewed faith in this place. We returned for the 3rd time (second time was a little disappointing), and was again, thoroughly impressed. We decided to change things up and order different items. We landed on the honey and garlic sauced chicken, and a side order of fried onion rings. Both were quite good in their execution. The batter used for the Honey garlic was notably different than those of the dry seasoning variety. The batter was thicker, heavier, and subsequently crisper than the flakier and lighter batter of the golden chicken. The change in batter was much appreciated as it carried the sauce a lot better without losing its lovely exterior crunch and interior juiciness. An added bonus to keep things interesting, was the addition of fried chewy rice cakes and Korean sweet potatoes, all covered in a generous sprinkling of roast crushed peanuts. The honey sauce, though sweet, was very well complimented by the sweet and sour side plates of pickled radishes and cabbages. We packed some of the meal home to enjoy later that night and the crispiness held up surprisingly well.\n\nA little tip, we arrived at about 6pm on a Monday evening, and was seated right away. The early dinner was definitely less hectic than the previous times. Staff were friendly and gracious. If you are there just for the food, come early and come not too hungry as it takes a bit of time for the food to arrive.", 4], ["Hands down, I think after coming to Mymy for the first time, I can confidently say that it's the best korean fried chicken restaurant in the area.\n\nMy service was really great. His name was Jae and he was so helpful with my group of friends. He gave us multiple servings of banchan when we asked and he was attentive to our specific needs.\n\nWe ordered the green onion fried chicken, garlic and soy sauce fried chicken and sweet potato fries. I was a bit surprised to find wasabi with the green onion, but it was still very delicious to eat. The garlic and soy sauce also comes with pieces of rice cake, and I would suggest asking for a fork to eat this dish. All the dishes have very unique flavours and it is that reason why I would definitely come back to this restaurant again.", 5], ["I got the half and half with the spicy sauce and the  cheese \nThey gave all white meat which some might prefer but I found it very dry and half to swallow. And the apps sent that great..  like how do u mess up pickled radish. Would not recommend, there are any better KFC elsewhere", 2], ["I wanted to try this place for a very long time, and finally got the chance to.\n\nThere's street parking beside the restaurant so that's nice.\n\nWe were seated right away, and the service was prompt. \n\nWe ordered the green onion fried chicken (), spicy rice cakes, and the fish cake soup.\n\nThey had left the door open for awhile so there were flies inside the restaurant, one of which landed in my spicy ddukbokki (rice cakes).\n\n2 servers came by and asked if we didn't enjoy the rice cakes (because they noticed that we didn't finish it - only had a few bites before the fly landed) and I politely explained to them that a fly had landed in my food and I had lost my appetite. \n\nNeither of the servers apologized or tried to accommodate around it - which I mean, I understand. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice, but they were playing hardcore EDM when we walked in and were waiting for food, and it made me anxious to eat to be honest. \n\nI think this place would be nice if I returned in a large group, but I may just stick to The Fry for now.", 4], ["Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 at a very packed restaurant. There was a waitlist so we put our name down and waited 25 mins. The waiting area wasn't very large so we stood in the narrow entrance to wait. While waiting, we patiently observed the patrons receving and eating their food. The fried chicken looked promising as it did in the photos and I couldn't wait until it was our turn.\n\nOnce seated, we noticed the chicken was priced higher than expected. It was around 30 dollars for each style. There was an option to do half and half, so we chose the onion and cheesey chicken (strangely advertised as 'women's pick'). As well, we got an order or fries and handmade dumplings.\n\nWe got our sides of popcorn, cubed pickled radish, and picked cabbage which is perfect to snack on and to cut the fattiness of the fried chicken. Our fries and dumplings arrived quickly soon after. These fries were amazing! Really crispy and a large amount. The dumplings looked really appetizing and was served with a dip to compliment it. Unfortunately, the meat inside was flavourless and fell short in delivery.\n\nThe chicken arrived and I really liked the crispness of the skin. However, it was moist inside for some pieces and really dry in others. I liked the onion more than the cheese.. The cheese felt like it wasn't meshing with the chicken itself and more as an interesting add-on.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the experience and atmosphere of the restaurant. However, I do like the Fry's chicken more. I think a fair comparison would be to try the green onion chicken to see which is more worth it. However, I would love to try more of the apps here because I think it would be done well for the most part.", 4], ["Went to Mymy chicken on Friday night. The restaurant was on a small side street. The restaurant was very crowded, but luckily we were able to get a table very quickly.\n\nWe ordered the half and half chicken which was half regular chicken and half spicy chicken. The fried chicken was very good, much better than KFC or Popeye chicken.\n\nWould we go back? Yes because the food was very good and affordable.", 4], ["It's been hard for me to indulge in Korean fried chicken back here in Canada after going through what had been a life-changing experience for me with fried chicken in Korea itself. I must say though, Mymy Chicken has probably been the closest to the fried chicken I've had in Korea. \n\nInitially before you order, you're given a few appetizers. Popcorn, salad, and the essential: pickled radish (aka the staple that goes with fried chicken... or the 'coleslaw' of KFC) I thought the popcorn was unique, though interesting that I would be snacking before I eat. \n\nWe ordered rice cake with an extra topping of cheese. To my surprise, I enjoyed the rice cake despite the fact that it lacked spiciness, and that's key to spicy rice cake. However, the rice cake itself was nicely cooked and chewy and there was definitely enough to share between two people (possibly three if you order something else)\n\nLemme tell you bout dat chicken doe. It comes out burning hot so I suggest you wait for it to cool down a bit - I've learnt that the hard way. We got the original flavour which was seasoned all throughout so you're not left with chewing on dry chicken that tastes like nothing. As well, the chicken breast is definitely not on the dry side, given that majority of the dish was fried chicken breast - but could be a little more tender. \n\nThe ambience is definitely meant for a young age group, judging from their extensive loud music consisting of only  Chainsmokers lolz. (Yup I was judging) Either way I'm looking forward to coming back and trying out the rest of the flavours!!!", 4], ["First time having korean fried chicken in TO. I came here last friday around 8pm - and the wait was an hour..so we left. This Friday at 9pm - we got a table almost right away. It's a dark place, they play loud hip hop, and loud chatter -- not suitable for kids. Ordered the half/half - golden cheese + spicy chicken and pitcher of Heineken. We werent super hungry...and when the food came out...it was way too much food for 2 people. But it's all good - you can pack it home. I personally like the spicy chicken better than the golden cheese. Its not really spicy - its a sweet korean bbq sauce. The golden cheese has a lighter, dry flavour. Overall, good crisp, moist, and piping hot. Came with complimentary popcorn and pink pickled cabbage with some mayo drizzled over. The mayo was kind of weird...it kind of clashed with the sweet/tangy pickle juice.\n\nBeer came in frosted glasses! Extra hold, clean, crisp taste.\n\nWould def recommend to others and come back.", 4], ["Uhmmmmmmmmm, one order of chicken costs $27-$28? Does this mean the chicken is made of gold? Not sure but I have never been to a restaurant that charges that much for just a average bowl of fried chicken. Anyway I ordered fire chicken and my friend wanted the pepper Chili chicken. The taste is not bad, definitely way better than \"the fry\" down the street. Total cost of the meal was around $60 excluding taxes.....Damn I felt like I paid for a seafood Michelin star dish", 3], ["ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FIND! so glad I came here for lunch on a Sunday. The server / bartender was phenomenal, nice, great service, friendly. I started off with the LQ old fashioned and then she told me about the $6 mimosas, so I had two. Slightly disappointed she waited until I bought my $13 drink to tell me about those considering I could have had TWO mimosas at that value. To eat I had the wings with honey bbq sauce and when I tell you these amazingly fried, savory, full flavored magically pieces of meat melted in my mouth, that's what I mean. They were the full wing (drums and wing) and it came with 7 of those, that now as I write this equates to 14 separate chicken wings. I had FOURTEEN CHICKEN WINGS!!!! I would return every day for those!! Superbly scrumptious! Overall can't wait to be back!!", 5], ["The venue is really cute and the outside overlooks a little pond. The food we ordered, both the jerk chicken sandwiches, were really good. The meat was thick and tender, and full of flavour without being too spicy.

Please, no more hot dogs and chicken fingers lols. Loch & Quay boasts a modern vibe, very simple decor and an overall chill atmosphere.

My cousin's only complaint is that the indoor lighting wasn't adequate.\n\nThe poke bowl might not seem that filling at first, but the black rice is carb-town. I really like how they incorporated mango into this poke bowl, however, they needed to add ingredients that had more of a 'crunch'. Overall, it tasted pretty good, just a bit pricey for what it's worth. We also ordered the Loch Smash Burger which looks amazing on camera. I love the buns, no McDonald's shit, but was disappointed that the burger itself was dry. Everything else was fine though, and I want to highlight that the fries were fantastic. They use a special ketchup sauce (made in-house) that was sweet and had a tint of chili flavour in it. I give the fries and the accompany sauce a solid 9/10.", 4], ["The Loch & Quay has lovely servers who are warm and welcoming.

The lofty minimalistic decor is quite inviting, chill out and easy listening music soundtrack on the speakers.\n\nThe menu is compact and easy to navigate with A big emphasis on wholesome ingredients.

The visual and auditory ambience was so diverting, that I just needed to walk around the entire place to see the windows, displays, games, and private rooms. If you think that you might be a geek, or if you might be a goth or even just a nerd, then this is the place for you. I felt right at home at the Storm Crow Manor.\nSomeone ordered a Darth Vader themed group drink (they have share-able drink bowls) and the combination of the vapour of the dry ice, Star Wars Imperial Theme music, the Sith Helmet Chalice and the light effects that spread through the bar made this really exciting. So now, I accept my challenge: go back, with a few friends, just to see this spectacle once again.\nThe atmosphere is an ecclectic combination of gothic, Star Wars, nerdy games (ok, I play D and D!) and various apocalyptic imagery (hello, Cthulu!). The Storm Crow Manor combined these worlds in an interesting way: a mansion-style bar, with a double staircase, striking decor, stained glass window panes, and private rooms. This is a very cool place, and we settled in happily for a quick beverage or two.\nAfter ordering up the featured Pumpkin Ale (which was seasonally tasty), my companions and I tried the featured dice drinking game, where you roll a 20 sided dice to determine what you will get as a shot. \nI have bad luck in D and D rolling (yes, I admit it - it's sad really) so I rolled a 6, but recieved a refreshing shot of Vulcan Mind Meld - a.k.a. creme de cacao and creme de menthe.  If you roll a 20, then you get to keep the shot glass!\nBasically, the whole experience was highly entertaining, and I will come back there again when I can.

Walking up it felt like you are walking up to a haunted house on the block, that one that the old lady walking her dog walks a little faster when she gets by it. But at the same time it feels welcoming like you'd imagine walking up to the home of the Munsters. \n\nAs previously indicated my friend and I had a reservation in the \"Monster Hunting Lodge\". Our table was nestled up to the fire place when we both really enjoyed as a cold December morning. The details that were put into the mantle were great, where cherubs would be they were skulled faced demons and tentacle wrapped pillars. On the walls were the tools of the trade, guns, clubs, axes and two giant monster heads caught my some game hunter, one of them being a Rancor. I guess we know what Luke did after his escape from Jabba's palace. \n\nThe table next to ours was playing DnD, I have never witnessed the game before and an older DM was walking through the younger players for their game. It was very neat to hear how their characters started to develop and the beginning of the back story. I felt bad when our Infinity Shots came out and the room went dark and the booming voice of Thanos, the Mad Titan himself came over the speaks. I didn't realize my friend and I were cosmic entities (although I suspected it) as we, without any troubles handled 3 Infinity Shots a piece. These slightly tart shots come out served with glowing stones, bubbling and smoking from dry ice that is actually safely trapped in the bottom. (As I could see the chunk at the bottom of the shot I truly feared it would fall back into my mouth and kill me but we later confirmed there is a screen). \n\nFor our bites we had the Legendary Chickpea Fries which were a chickpea batter fried and served with a spicy aioli. I really enjoyed the fries because the fry batter was spiced like an Indian chana masala. The pairing of the spicy aioli really played up on it. Besides the fries we had the Mega Nacho One and added BBQ pulled pork. The large size can feed more than 2 and comes served with sour cream and a smokey salsa. We had expected something with more heat, my friend actually ended up getting some hot sauce on the side. I really enjoyed the smokey salsa because overall it played well with the flavors of the nachos. \n\nIf you are a gamer, a nerd, a geek or whatever you certainly want to check this place out. Each room as its own theme, I didn't venture farther than the washrooms which are located in the basement. \nMy one takeaway is that this location is not handicapped friendly due to the stairs required to enter and the stairs required to get to the washrooms in the basement. There maybe a lift I didn't see to get in however IDK if there was one for the basement.", 4], ["Storm Crow Manor is a restaurant/Bar located near downtown and a short walk from work. We visited as a group on a team event and had a reservation on a Monday night.  upon arriving, we were seated promptly and out table was ready and set up. \n\nI am not sure what is the theme of the restaurant but it was really cool I would describe it as something related to Halloween with skulls and cat skeletons. I really enjoyed looking at the little details on the decorations on the way to the restrooms in the basement. \n\nThe menu  adheres to the theme with funny drink and food names. I settled for a wheat beer from the craft list which was pretty standard.  For the main meal I had the steak sandwich with poutine.  I cannot say either the sandwich or the poutine were remarkable but they were  good enough. \nThe restaurant also offers drinks to share (What I would refer to as a fish bowl) and we ordered the one that comes in a darth vader helmet. The drink is some fruity  rum punch but it gets delivered with a show of lights and sounds and dry ice which was the highlight of the evening.\n\nWe really enjoyed our time at storm crow manor and were able to play some board games to keep the night interesting. I would definitely recommend it for team events and drinks but maybe grab dinner somewhere else?", 4], ["Eccentric bar where every room is unique and full of surprises, definitely an interesting place to visit for tourists and locals alike.  Many fun drinks and board games, food is decent as far as bar food goes, but the portion is relatively small for the price.  \n\nI really enjoy Random Shot ($6), where I rolled a dice to pick a drink, ended up with Vulcan Mindmeld (Creme de Menthe, Creme de Cacao) which was delicious.  If you prefer to select your own shot, you can for a dollar more.  \n\nAnother drink highlight is Cthulhu Tiki (Rum, Pineapple Juice, Cream of Coconut, OJ), it comes in a Cthulhu shaped mug which makes a cool souvenir.  The drink and the mug cost $30.\n\nService could be slow due to the bar's popularity.  Our recent visit was on Friday after Halloween, there was still some cool Halloween decoration and the servers were in costumes, I loved the fun atmosphere.  Even though the bar was packed and super busy, our servers were pleasant and polite.", 4], ["This is one of my favourite places to come to! The food is always amazing, and the atmosphere is perfect for any nerd at heart like myself. The building in itself is worth the visit with so many cool trinkets and rooms, the washrooms downstairs are event designed to look like a dungeon! \n\nThe servers are always extremely friendly and helpful and generally fast even on event nights. Their themed foods like the dungeon burger and dark side drink are so unique and fun. I have gotten the dungeon burger twice now and it's such a fun experience rolling the dice to build your burger. \n\nEvery chance I get I come here, and have an amazing experience each time.", 5], ["Update: I have updated my review once again to bump up Storm Crow Manor to 4/5 stars because of their new kickass patio. I attended their Halloween In July Patio Party and it can now accommodate many more people. You can learn more about it here: http://www.suziethefoodie.com/storm-crow-manor-july-patio-party/\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI asked for a tour so I could do a featured post for my site Suzie The Foodie so I was not exactly undercover when I went but wow, what a spectacular restaurant! I mean just the visuals, the size, the volume of coolness and geekiness! \n\nFrom rooms of heaven and hell to a Blade Running cyberpunk room, an apothecary room, Twin Peaks/Shining Hybrid bar showing room... Seriously, it is huge in comparison to their original location on Commercial Drive in Vancouver. Over the top in the best of ways. They have given the space gothic Toronto flare without losing the heart of what the Storm Crow is all about. Cthulhu watched over me during the interview and I felt right at home.\n\nI ordered the Dana Scully's Sceptical French Toast with a side of bacon that came in an X (so clever) and it was delicious. French toast was crisp on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. Just the way I like it and the bacon was perfectly crisp. As much as I loved going to the Storm Crows in Vancouver I never had a dish I would order again which was the main reason why I did not go there all the time. Here? So far, no excuses. In fact, I want to explore everything.\n\nI will be back undercover investigate and report back. Right now I am additionally impressed to hear they have a plethora of non-alcohol beverages for people to order. Smart way to make more money and encourage people to come during the day for more than just brunch. I know I will be. My only complaint? No decaf coffee! Seriously? Hot chocolate was quite good. Oh and there is no washroom on the main floor so there is limited accessibility and lots of stairs to contend with.

This was our first time at this spot, we came to celebrate a friends' birthday. They have a nice patio, bar and unique and fun themed dining rooms inside the manor. Keep an eye out for Hugh he was a doll and  the best server there ! He was so helpful recommending drinks and apps. I tried a few drinks: Romulan ale, Beetle juice, blade runner, chick pea fries and the  teenage mutant ninja turtle pickles.\n\nHugh's drink and app recommendations were perfect. There were many vegan and vegetarian food options so that was a plus; both the chick pea fries and teenage mutant ninja turtle pickles were great apps. My personal fav drink was Beetle juice which came with two gummy worms and the drink was served bubbling and tasted like melon so I'd highly recommend it (NB: ask Hugh how fast they run out of the gummy worms he'll let you know).\n\nIt's entertaining how the servers  bring some of the drink bowls to your table with lighting and music as an added effect. There were also plenty of games upstairs as well if you want to play board games.\nOverall it was a great spot for decently priced good food, drinks and friendly service.", 5], ["We were unjustly treated very poorly this evening at Storm Crow Manor, and none of us will return in the future.\n\n40 minutes ago, from the time of this review, we arrived at the manor, and went upstairs to the very top of the bar.  I will couch this review with:  It WAS busy.  It's Halloween night this evening.\n\nWe wanted to grab some food and a couple drinks after walking the Halloween Church Street beat.\nWe were not drunk.  We were absolutely not disorderly.\n\nThe top of the building bar area was busy.  We waited a few minutes, got a guy's attention politely, and ordered some beer.  They male working this bar snapped and screamed \"This is not a cocktail bar!!! Go get a seat!!!\"   Now, we have been to the manor manor times but have never been to the top.  So we thought, ok we are clearly in the wrong area - despite people standing Aaron's the bar drinking.  So we need to find a seat.  We backed up a few paces and sat at  a completely empty table.  \n\nA server came up and asked if we were seated.  All of us kind of answered at once: \"yes\", \"we were told to sit down\", and I mumbled \"I'm not sure\".  The server said they would get us some menus.  A couple minutes pass.\n\nAnother server comes up and says: \"I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"  We just stare, completely ago,  as one would when confronted with something so out of left field as this.  Of course we asked why.  \"Apparently you screamed at one of our servers\".   Jaws dropped.  This absolutely never happened.  I don't know if we were mistaken for somebody else, or the server at the bar was having a a bad day and decided to take it out on us.  We VERY politely denied this, and in a very compliant way left the premises, albeit very confused.\n\nWe went down the road to a place called The Cherie Bistro.  It has better food and prices, and we are quite happily finishing our meat here as I type this.\n\nIf anyone from Storm Crow Manor denies our claims, they are absolutely lying.  We are conscientious people who have all been severs in the past.  They just have a really bad male server working that upper bar tonight.\n\nBuy I also blame the restaurant for being over capacity to the point where they cannot keep track of customers.", 1], ["This place has so much potential, but really needs to step up its service game. Our group stopped by the patio for drinks and eats on a Wednesday night. I love the patio - it's pretty big, with a fully functioning bar and some umbrellas for cover. Quite a few tables were free when we got there around 7, but it filled up quickly. \n\nIn terms of drinks, I opted for a sour beer. There is a good selection of beers on tap and a vast cocktail list, but nothing really appealed to me. My friend had the butter beer cocktail and to be honest, it was really gross. It didn't taste at all like alcohol, and just like pure sugar. I would recommend sticking to beer and wine, since the cocktails all seem really sugary. \n\nThe biggest reason my rating is so low is because the service was terrible. The server was really slow from the beginning of the evening and barely stopped by the table. It took awhile to get our drinks and to take our food order. Not her fault, but the food took forever. Once it finally came out, my friend's steak sandwich was really over cooked. It was well done but she asked for it medium rare. I had the French dip with greens and it was actually really good. It had a ton of meat, but I didn't get why the dip was in such a small ramekin - I could barely dip my sandwich in. \n\nOur plates sat empty forever, and so were our drinks. I definitely would have loved to order more drinks, but our server didn't even walk by. We had to track her down to ask for the bill (after asking someone else) and it still took forever. \n\nI absolutely love the patio and the concept, but probably won't be coming back because of the service.", 2], ["Very fun night end of April to celebrate work successes. If you are looking to book a table for a group of 20, they don't do reservations over the phone so send an email to the address on their website. The person responding was prompt. \n\nFood was ok since I don't like bar food. Pulled jackfruit burger was too sweet. I did enjoy the chick pea fries a lot. Fried chicken and biscuits dish was overly dry (gravy was needed for sure) and greasy but the pickled veggies and apple sauce were a nice touch. \n\nI had the Wakanda Smash and What We Drink in the Shadows (sangria basically). Interesting names but nothing special. \n\nAnother negative was the ants crawling on the table and padded bench we were sitting on. \n\nHighlights were definitely decor and roll the dice shots. I would visit again to check out another section of the restaurant.", 3], ["Had an amazing time at Storm Crow Manor for dinner. It is a sci-fi themed restaurant and everything on the menu references to many tv shows, movies, and games.\n\nI ordered the chao chicken of tzeentch as my main and the old naan's pudding of warming for dessert. Both were very delicious and the portions are BIG. I would highly recommend this place! The interior design and aesthetics is an A+. When you get the bill they give you a Magic of the Gathering card per person", 5], ["Came here with some friends to celebrate graduating and we had a lot of fun! The interior is incredibly unique! Every corner, every wall delivers an unforgettable and unique experience and we really enjoyed it. When someone orders a specific drink, sometimes the associated theme song plays (reminded me of rainforest cafe storms back in the day). We ordered some snacks including nachos, wings, and fried pickles. They were all really good and really affordable! The food was surprisingly yummy. We also did the dice roll to determine which shot we get which was so much fun, every shot actually tasted good and the process was lots of fun!\n\nOn the flip side; the not so good aspects of this place were some of the cocktails. The Halloween themed Pi\u00f1a Skullada was gross. It was just sour and chocolatey and didn't make sense. I barely got through my glass and I do not recommend. My friends also got the \"IT\" themed cocktail with the balloon and complained that it was just sour and didn't have much flavour. Finally, our server was sweet but seemed frustrated, impatient, and full of fake smiles which was disappointing at times because we felt like we weren't welcome. I get that parties can be frustrating for a server sometimes, but the last thing you should do as an employee is let a negative vibe ruin the guest's experience. \n\nOverall I still highly recommend this place, the food and shots were great, unforgettable interior, but they can improve on the friendliness of staff and, while many of the cocktails were great, some of them tasted awful and it's really a gamble if you aren't familiar with the menu.", 3], ["First off, love the concept of this place. I'm a board game geek myself so seeing these cute little references to games and things excite me. That being said, the menu was a little hard to follow as the names of the food are not necessarily straight to the point lol but overall cute concept.\n\nGreat staff as well. Everyone was friendly from the door to when we left and asked if they can help us take a photo at the front. Decor was cute (stranger things Christmas light walls, skull collage washroom hallway etc) so definitely picture friendly.\n\nI ordered the chicken burger, dont remember the fancy name for it. My friends opted for pulled pork and one went for the D&D burger. They also got butterbeer and such.\n\nChicken burger - choice of grilled or fried chicken, and comes with guac, a chipotle aioli, and some other stuff that did pair really well with the burger. A little tang and spice from the chipotle that gets softened by the avocado. Chicken was also nice and juicy. The bun itself was nice and soft and not too buttery. \n\nComes with side fries or salad and I opted for salad. Salad was a little overdressed for my liking, but when I told my server I have a nut allergy they were really considerate and ensured that they would provide me with food that's not contaminated to their best capabilities. \n\nShout out to their D&D burger. Basically a burger where you let chance decide on what it's made of by rolling a dice. Of course you can end up changing your order since you just fill out a form and tick the box of whatever the number rolled is for that section. But if your up for the random, follow the dice! Love it!\n\nOverall would love to come back to try other things on the menu! U leave with a Magic card as a little incentive. Very cute.", 4], ["This place was super unique and definitely something different than your average bar. This place is a house sized bar with different rooms and areas that all have different themes. They range from super obvious references, to some more nerdy and obscure ones, but there is something here for everyone. \n\nThe menu is a mix of cute puns for tasty cocktails and food. The food is decent with the prices being what you would expect for Toronto. Service is super friendly, and warm with a very welcoming vibe (which I guess makes sense for the area). \n\nI ordered a couple of cocktails that were all very cutesy, and pretty, but very sweet (think juice more than alcohol). Ask your waiter to point out the drinks with dry ice because they are always fun! The food was good, but nothing too exciting. If I were to go back, it would probably be for drinks and the atmosphere, or maybe to join the group playing DnD at the table next to ours!\n\nMy friend and I took a quick peek through the entire manor, I but I will definitely be back to keep exploring!", 4], ["Nerdiest bar I have ever been to and I love every second here!\n\nI came here for a double date and my oh my is the decor over the top and perfect!!\n\nMy friend practically went all out here! She ordered Butter Beer, which is based on Harry Potter, and she shared the flashy bottle of Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster! Four people. Four glass with a different colour light and ice cubes inside. Special lighting effects and dry ice. Super cool.\n\nDungeon burger, where you customize your burger based on the results of a D20 die, a 20 sided die. Be honest! Veggie patty? Vegan aioli sauce? Gluten-free patty? Potato patty? Lettuce. Cheese. Sides. Everything you get depends on what number you roll! Do you dare to try?\n\nThe washrooms were unisex and designed like BUNKERS!\n\nTheir Botany Bay veggie burger was well done.\nI love their creative names for all of their menu items.\n\nThis place is definitely a place where great and fun conversations happen!!\n\nLocation: 4/5 (East of Wellesley station, walking distance)\nDecor: 6/5 (inside an entire manor, epic decor in every corner or room)\nFood quality: 4.5 (creative and hardy)\nService: 4.5/5 (friendly and fast)\nValue: 5/5 (very entertaining)\n\nOverall: totally perfect place to grab a burger or a drink at night with friends!

Lovecraft, Alien, Dungeons & Dragons; the list goes on. The menu item naming sense is hilarious; my friends and I had some good laughs at the dish and drink names. \nThe first time I came here, we shared a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster (shareable cocktail; comes served with restaurant light theatrics), I got Butterbeer, and the Optimus Prime Rib. My boyfriend was a trooper; he got a Dungeon Burger, and despite his HORRIBLE rolls, he insisted on keeping what he rolled... So he ended up with a burger that he named 'Veggie Hell'. It tasted pretty good, considering it had everything in a combination that we both disliked (veggie patty, gluten free bun, jalapeno, red onion, veggie chili, pico de gallo, ranch dressing, goat cheese, yellow mustard). We laughed a lot at his burger. \nThe second time I came here, my friends and I shared a set of Infinity Shots (also comes with restaurant light theatrics). I rolled for a random shot, and got Pickle Rick, which I blanched at, so the waiter let me reroll, and I got The Machete (thankfully didn't get something worse!). Second time, food-wise, I stuck to my steak, but my friend said that her lasagna was amazing, so I'll take her word for it. \nAnyway. Come here for a fun time!

The food was good, but nothing amazing (the fries were a bit soggy).\n\nThe highlight of this place is definitely the interior - there are many differently themed rooms, which are worth checking out! There are also board games available. \n\nAll in all, this is a fun place to hang out with friends, and I'd recommend it.", 4], ["Wow. Seriously, the coolest bar EVER.\n\nI stumbled upon this place while visiting Toronto for the day... and this bar was definitely the highlight of the trip. \nSo I think nerdy/geeky people would really appreciate this bar.

I would love to come back when I visit Toronto!", 5], ["Geek heaven!\nMe and some of my friends got into the spirit and dressed up gothic-ish to fit the interior. \nEach room has a different theme. My favourite is the underwater room on the first floor located on the right when you walk in at the far back. The second coolest room is upstairs on your right hand side. Very retro and cool. We made a reservation for 9 people, they had trouble finding enough room for all of us to sit down but managed to find a spot to squeeze us in. The seating isn't that great, its just a long bench on the inside and chairs on the outside. If you're sitting on the inside you have to ask everyone to move out of the way if you need to get out. \nFor the drinks menu they give you a 20 sided dice to roll to try and win a shot glass to bring home. All of the shots are really light off of the 20-sided dice menu, i think i drank like 10 shots with no feeling. Yes they were mixed shots not straight ones. The entire menu has cute names for the drinks and food. Careful rolling the dice, you might end up with pickle juice! Our group won 2 shot glasses to bring home. \nThe food was okay, not the greatest. The service was not that great, our server would forget when we asked for anything. The game selection was small but we spent most of the night just chatting away. By the end of the night the tables were clearing so we got to go into each room and take pictures.

There is simply no equal in town.\n\nWhile the food here won't blow any minds, they are priced reasonably and comparable or better than your average neighbourhood pub. The main attraction is of course the decor and the fact that you can eat, drink and play board games.\n\nIf having a Butterbeer to go with some Dracarys Dragon Eggs or chickpea fries over a game of Code Names in a Cyberpunk room sounds great to you, this is definitely the place to be!", 5], ["My go to spot for pupusas.

They sell a variety of Latino products such as authentic sauces, taco and tortilla shells, spices and peppers and even fried pork rinds!  But most people seem to be most attracted by their hot food area.  Serving a variety of Latino favourites such as pupusas, tamales, tostadas and tacos, the food here is authentic and homely.  Stuff you would probably find in a Latin American home.  We had the soup of the day (beef) and it was outstanding!  With big chunks of beef, tomatillos, carrots and cabbage, it's food that a Latin grandma would have made.\n\nThe store is a bit weird in that the seating area is part of a converted garage and you have to walk up the stairs to order.

It wasn't until I walked inside did I realize this was such a popular place.\n\nIt's quite confusing at first when you step inside because it's a bunch of tables with no staff really at the entrance. You have to go to the second floor to place your order at the cashier, and then go to the back/kitchen area to give the ladies there your order slip.\n\nThe pupusas were WONDERFUL, and at a fair price. The pupusas are all handmade and you can decide on what type of pupusa you want. I tried the chicken and cheese (because I wanted to be healthy) and the Revuelta (refried beans, cheese, meat). Honestly, if I decided to come eat pupusas, why should I have even tried to be healthy. The Revuelta stood out and left my taste buds wanting more.\n\nFor the price and quality, I'm definitely coming back here. I just hope this hidden gem doesn't get too popular because there isn't that much space and the kitchen is not the industrialized type- maybe more of a stove you see in a food truck.", 5], ["I'm hungry and I'm ready to eat! Is this an Emporium with food?\n\nI went to the Kensington Market looking for some good dinner. I was in the mood for some El Salvadorian food and I saw this place had pupusas. I was happy to see they had the pupusas but I soon found they did not have any rice or beans.  Hmmm...I thought it was a bit strange for a Latin place. I guess there are beans and rice in the burritos but you can't order them separately. \n\nThe staff was friendly enough but our language barrier was a bit hard. When I ordered they forgot a chicken taco. When I asked for them to make it, they said they were closing. I ordered several things but the chicken taco was for my mom. So she had nothing to eat. I understand that they were closing but they should've finished our order first. We were even rushed out when we were eating. It probably would've been nice if they told us they were closing in 15 minutes and we would not be able to eat inside.\n\nI think Latin Emporium's food was just ok. The pupusa was decent, and the yucca was deep fried a little more than I like. I usually like my plantains warm and they were served cold.\n\nLastly, I was a bit turned off with the two chickens that were above the food. It literally looked like two dead chickens on top where the food is prepared. There was a sign that said the roosters/chickens would rooster if you tip. It's cute but ummmm.... the chickens looked too real for me...especially when I'm eating chicken. Maybe have a different animal up there...\n\nThere are lot of places to eat at in Kensington Market, and the next time I am in Canada I most likely will try somewhere else.", 3], ["Traditional pupusas!

The order of things in here is so latin american and it made me love it. You order, you hand your order to an older lady that comes out from the back just to make you a fresh pupusa. \n\nBut what's wrong with it? The pupusa had no flavor inside and out. Lacked a respectable amount of stuffing, the lettuce/cabbage and carrot shavings were dry, the salsa was okay. I'm sorry but when you're used to Atlacatl Restaurant out here in LA, my pupusas standards are going to be high.\n\nThe only pro is how you get to watch them be made and they're given to you on the spot.\n\nEven though, the pupusa disappointed I have to respect the store aspect of Emporium Latino. They had so many hispanic essentials from all over latin america. Salsas, pancake flour, cooking oils, inca cola (their soda collection is legit), spices...they come through. If I lived in Toronto, I could see myself becoming a habitual customer of this place. \n\nCome and check it out, the pupusas aren't that great but if you've never had one, you can only go up from here.

If you go up the stairs, you'll see the cash register area, and that's where you place your food order. \n\nSince it was my first time here, I requested recommendations from the girl working here. She was very helpful and explained the different food they have, mostly el salvadorean, and made recommendations of what to try.  We ended up trying the corn tamales and three different types of Pupusas - Revualta which is beans, cheese & pork, Sausage & cheese, and chicken & cheese. It's served with a side of coleslaw topped with either mild or spicy sauce. \n\nWhat can I say about the food? It's made from scratch, it's fresh & flavourful, and it's made with love. I loved the combination of the slaw, spicy sauce and pupusa together. I barely remember thinking I should take a picture of the food, except there was none left on my plate.  It's also very affordable with the pupupas coming in at less than $3 each, and the tamales just a little over $3. \n\nI'm definitely planning to return again.", 4], ["Good for the price and it was tasty.

Nooooooo!!! :(  **\n\nFood: I had two Colombian empanadas (veggies) and friend plaintain with cheese. The empanadas were so delicious- it was filled with potatoes, peas, corns and just a bit of spice. The hot sauce that was given was sooo delicious! \nThe fried plaintain was surprisingly not too greasy. I was imagining a deep fried plaintain like tempuras. The cheese was gooey and the plaintain was warm, just the right temperature to savour.\n\nService: The young gentleman(by the cashier) showed me what some of the food looked like (e.g. empanadas, plaintains..etc). The lady in the kitchen asked me how I would prefer the food to be (hot? warm? with hot sauce or mild sauce?). She packed the food to go(at my request) in plastic containers and had utensils and napkins to go with it in one plastic bag. I love it when everything is in one place(otherwise I would lose things). \n\nExtra notes: \n1) This place is tiny, so if you are coming in with a big group, watch out for things around you. There is a large menu right before you go and order food, so look at that menu instead. \n\n2) There aren't that many seats here. From what I saw, you can likely sit with 3-4 other friends. \n\n3) This place accepts credit card and debit card.

The Tamale was so delicious with a generous amount of stuffing and a crispy outer layer.

Also, they sell you the ingredients to make them at home which, I do, and are always a hit at my parties.   \n\nAside that, remember this place is also a market, selling most of what you would need for dinner or to make specific Latin dishes, not to mention general groceries.  \n\nI highly recommend checking this place out if you are in Kensington, want an inexpensive snack and you are on the go!", 4], ["The pupusa and the tamale are fantastic, they are made in the back of a grocery store, made fresh to order.", 4], ["I've been here several times and it's a great place to get a few groceries and cooked food.

My favourite so far is the revuelta pupusas.  One of the women there was very helpful by telling me how to make a traditional Mexican dish (pollo mole verde) I was trying to replicate that I use to get from an authentic Mexican restaurant that shut down.

They also sell hot food, you order at the checkout, hand the ticket ot the lady cooking and then hope one of the stools against the high shelf or bench at the front of the shop stays vacant for when you food is ready.  \n\nThis is very good food, not strictly Mexican, but very South of the Border, a little Salvadoran, a little Mexican, a little special.  I started off with a Salvadoran style chicken tamal, basically chicken and pressed potato cooked in a broad leaf and a couple of flautitas, which for you gingos are flutes of fried corn tortilla filled with yumminess.  They were very good, so good that I felt compelled to eat a pair of beef tostadas and two soft pork tacos.  The food here is superb, not superb in a grand restaurant way, but superb in a seriously authentic Latin American way.  Emporium Latino is now my second favourite Mexican (and El Salvadoran) restaurant in this fine city, Tacos El Asador, still hitting the number one spot.\n\nI am also massively happy with the way that Kensington Market is turning into a little Mexico.

They make them to order, so it does take a little while to get your food. The pickled cabbage that comes with the pupusas is so crunchy, tangy and full of flavour. Adds a refreshing kick to the heavier pupusas. I usually order the pork pupusas or the beans-and-cheese.

The churro was so delicious that I refused to eat anything else for hours just to help my mouth remember how yummy it was.  \n\nThe only reason I docked it 1 star was because the seating is less than ideal, especially b/c I so wanted to sit on a patio.

The man bartended to an empty room for months after spending the money on the lovely reclaimed wood bar along the front window and the awesome penny encrusted bar that still remains.

Roughly 30 minutes later, I finally felt normal again but be warned! This shot is NOT for the lighthearted!\n\nThe decor of the place was so cute. They have drawings and quotes written all over the walls and one of the shelves have the Harry Potter Funko Pop! dolls all lined up.\n\nKeep in mind though that this is not strictly a Harry Potter bar. It's just a normal bar with Harry Potter decorations and themed drinks. Don't expect to walk into the Leaky Cauldron or the Three Broomsticks - you can get that at Universal Studios' Harry Potter World. But for a place that's not officially associated with Harry Potter, this bar is awesome. I'd definitely come back again to try their other drinks!", 5], ["Setting: small bar, has a Harry Potter theme extending to its drinks menu. Personally felt the theming was not particularly followed through what with the numerous bottles of American whisky on show and overall un-hogwarts feel of the bar. I guess it's difficult balancing act of having a theme but not going full Disney world and becoming tacky.\n\nDrinks : great selection, the butter beer was bizarrely exactly what I imagined it to taste like, despite consisting of ginger ale. \n\nAtmosphere: chill and dark, friendly locals, our group was definitely made to feel welcome. \n\nStaff: friendly and quick. One bartender had hair like hermione, though she laboured the point a few times that this was coincidental \n\nRecommmend, would come back", 3], ["Being Harry Potter fans we had to try the Lockhart while we were in Toronto. It is small, but friendly with a great staff. The drink menu was cool and had Harry Potter themed drinks. We had the Butter Beer which was awesome! The Cafe Moscow is addictive with it's Coffee infused vodka. Be prepared to wait, but it is fun once you get in.", 5], ["I went here with some friends who are also Harry Potter fans to celebrate finishing my doctorate. As others have said, the Harry Potter part of it is subtle - probably due to copyright infringement. Don't expect to be immersed in the Three Broomsticks or the Leaky Cauldron but expect to be like, \"Aw, like the potion\" or \"Aw, it's a stag,\" etc. \n\nWe got to The Lockhart around 5pm, which was lucky because shortly after we were seated, a very long line began to form outside. The waitress was nice enough to let a couple of my friends who were a bit late join us since we were seated at benches and could squeeze in, but another friend who was even later wasn't able to come in. The two late people had to have their drinks quickly because they needed our table. \n\nThis place isn't cozy small, it's just plain small, go with one other person and be prepared to go elsewhere if it's packed; it's good but not worth the wait in the freezing cold for over an hour that people were doing (the owners were kind enough to put a heater outside for people but I don't think it's worth waiting that long). It's also a little difficult to enjoy yourself when you know there is a long line of people staring at you wishing you would hurry the bleep up so they can have their turn to chill.\n  \nTo the food! We had the popcorn (yummy), baked brie with jam and puff pastry with bread (great), and the mac and cheese sliders (awesome). I split the befuddlement draft with a friend - it wasn't the best tasting drink in the world but the presentation was fun (they set it on fire) and it was served in a fancypants cauldron of the non-leaky variety.", 4], ["First this place just opened and there is clearly a lot of hype (if they weren't Harry Potter themed they would probably get 4 stars) Visiting the Niagara area from the states and saw this place on Facebook and I pretty much forced my mom into going. They did unfortunately open the doors at 5:30 on Friday but I was already first in line and decided on waiting. The decor is subtle, which in my option is smart. I don't want to go to a themed bar that has wands and pictures of Harry everywhere. \n\nNow for food and drinks. I ordered The Shacklebolt and The Death Shot. The drink was so tasty and the shot was very hot, but still weirdly enjoyable. I had the deep fried mac and cheese sliders which although hard to eat like a slider I found a way to inhale them. \n\nThe service was a little scattered but hey this place has been open a week. Everyone that worked their was very friendly, especially the owners. If I lived in the area is frequent after the hype slows down.", 5], ["I have been waiting to come here since it first opened.

Like someone else said, the bar was dive-y but it fit the Harry Potter theme very well.\n\nWe had the Befuddlement Draft and the River Rocks AKA Black Lake Croquette.\n\n The draft was alright, the experience of getting the drink was more enjoyable than the drink, per se. But all around worth the amount that you pay for it.\n\nThe croquette was good too, very rich flavour and well-made.\n\nAll in all, would go again!...but only for the feature things they have", 5], ["This place was great! We waited in line for just a few minutes. Once we got in, we got drinks right away. I got the Shaklebolt. It was delicious--spicy and gingery. I loved it. \nWhile my friend and i were sitting at the bar, we struck up a conversation with the bartender (who ended up being one of the owners) and he was SO nice.

We started off with the Better Beer pitcher..  Oh my gosh... so good.  Tasted like a vanilla coke float with some marshmellow hints.  I'll be honest, I'm pretty sure this was pretty strong, because after that I vaguely remember some sort of drink that was set aflame...  it's a little foggy.  \n\nThis was a hoot.. and we chatted with all sorts of people inside.  Definitely delicious!.", 3], ["As you might have allowed yourself to remember--or not, depending on your level of overexcitement anticipating a visit here--this bar is not literally affiliated with Warner Bros.

Luckily, the bar doesn't actually have anything to do with Harry Potter. If you want that, I recommend Universal Studios.\n\nAll of that being said, it sort of just becomes a bar, at that point. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely Harry Potter inspirations here. The neon 'All Was Well' sign, the drinks named after characters (such as the cleverly titled 'Gin Weasley'), and uh...the fact that 'Potions & Elixirs' is painted on the wall above the alcohol? It's cool and all, don't get me wrong. And without getting the attention of Warner Bros. legal counsel, there's only so much they can do here.\n\nThe drinks we had were pretty strong. Personally, that causes me to enjoy it less. That might make some of you rate it a 10 out of 5 here. Ya know, if you're heavily into drinking. You might be thinking, \"Josh L., why were you even at a bar if you don't like drinking?\" That's a fair question. I don't have a good answer for you. We were mainly curious about the Harry Potter stuff.\n\nOverall, it's fine. The staff is awesome, I should say. Maybe my expectations were too high that it would be straight out of the books or movies. Seems like a good business idea, though: Just slightly rip off an extremely popular franchise. Maybe I'll open a convenience store called \"The Pocket Monster Stop\" or a car wash called \"The Bogdan Express\". Can you name what show I ripped off that second one from?", 3], ["Stopped by on a Sunday around 1 pm and thankfully it was pretty empty. \nTried the new brunch, everything was al la carte and We thought that was cool. \nNothing fancy about basic breakfast , but that's all we wanted anyway. \nThe service was great but place was empty but the staff appreciated the fact they had time to chat and get to know us.

This place did not disappoint. Great ambience and very cozy with the floor seating option. They had a cute sign that said , \"No wifi, talk to each other\". Little things like that made this small family run restaurant unique. The only thing was that the service was a bit rushed, makes sense as it was a Saturday night.

The decor was very Tibetan and also the music- the atmosphere definitely felt like we were away from Toronto.\n\nThe menu was very descriptive, vegan friendly and easy to order. They were a bit busy but did their best to accommodate us. We ended up ordering 2 variants of the Momo - the chilli and the jhol. The chilli Momo could be described as a combination of chinese and indian influences (think hakka). The jhol on the other side almost was like a coconut thai curry. The actual momo's had a wonderful noodle texture that pops in your mouth with generous fillings. Sometimes it took more than one bite.\n\nI am definitely a big fan of Tibetan cuisine.

The Aloo Phingsha is a combination of vermicelli, fungus, and beef in a broth. The beef was a bit chewy, but I enjoyed the rest of the dish, and it went well with the rice provided on the side. The chilly chicken was not as spicy as expected, and tasted similar to Tandoori chicken. The dishes are very affordable (most mains are under $10) and I would recommend Shangrila to anyone looking for a great value meal.", 4], ["Nice cosy small place. Friendly staff. Amazing food.

Jhol momo, which is a bowl of wonderful, spicy curry soup and steamed dumplings... so good. Try it if you haven't, because it's killer. The veg Shangrila noodle dish is flavourful and spicy (not like other places where the vegetarian options, especially noodles, tend to be bland and flavourless). Ther veg chow mein is also very good. The veg hot and sour soup (sans egg) is perfect, as is the tofu manchurian. The portion size of that one could be a bit bigger for the price, but it's still delicious. But one thing you MUST order when you go, vegetarian, vegan or otherwise, is the crispy cauliflower. And you must try it with one of their hot sauces. It is super. Just a flavour explosion! \n\nAs mentioned, the service is accommodating, knowledgeable and attentive. There is a minimal wait for food most times we go.

We started off with the vegetarian momo's, but were warned that it will take some time to make. It arrived after around 15 minutes piping hot in a bamboo steam basket. They looked exactly like Chinese dimsums, so I found it really odd not eating them with chopsticks. They served this with their hot sauce. Omg, these momo's were spectacular and with the hot sauce the flavour was even more amplified!\nFortunately, it was a weekend, so I was able to order their thali. I chose the vegetarian one with the fried cauliflower. One friend got the mutton curry with their steamed bread (forgot the name) and my other friend got the paneer Manchurian with rice.\nMy thali was so simple but this simplicity was what made it so good. The spices and flavours did not hit you in the face, they were very subtle but yet the food seemed so pure, and again, simple, where you can actually taste the ingredients actual flavours. The portion size was perfect and there was free re-fills for the thali, except the fried cauliflower.\nThe mutton curry was a total hit! He loved it, especially when he soaked the steamed bread into the gravy. I tried the mutton gravy and again, you can actually taste the flavour of mutton rather than just spices. \nThe service was great and I will definitely make this place a regular. Next time I gotta try their spicy fries, which I got a glimpse of from the table nearby, and it looked incredible!", 5], ["A friend took me here last night so that I could try something new and it was fantastic!\n\nWe both got an order each of the fried beef momo ($8.99) and my friend also got an order of the chicken fried rice ($6.99). \n\nThe momo was fantastic! I especially loved the house chili sauce that they came with. It gives a great kick! I didn't end up having any of the rice since the order size of the momo was perfect to fill me up, but my friend cleaned his plate, so I assume it was really good as well, lol.\n\nThe service was also top-notch, very friendly and the prices are unbeatable.

It was all delicious, not overly spicy but there is chili sauce to add if you wish. I finished up with my usual cup of butter tea.

It was returned in perfect condition (except for those slices we ate of course).\n\nOn top of the service and decor, the food was absolutely bomb! Our table of 4 shared the Cavalo Caesar Salad (kale caesar), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mushroom Brushcetta to start. The Cavalo caesar was tasty and every ingredient complimented eachother. I wasn't too heavy and tasted heavenly. The grilled octopus was tender and delicious. The mushroom bruchetta was also delicious and had lots of mushrooms on top.\n\nFor our mains we had the Calamarata (Spicy seafood pasta), Taliatelle (Bolognese ragu pasta) and the Mafalde Al Funghi (Mushroom Truffle Cream Sauce). Can I just say, my personal dish, the Mafalde Al Funghi, was THE BEST mushroom cream pasta I've had thus far, and it's not because I was just hungry. If you love cream pasta, and mushrooms you must try this. Combined with the truffle oil, it just brought my pasta experience to another level. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and complimented this rich sauce so well. I had a sample of the other 2 pastas which were very very good in their own right, but the mushroom pasta was the best in my opinion. If you're lactose intolerant, be wary though.\n\nI'm glad I finally got to try Gusto 101 and am looking forward to my next visit hopefully very very soon.", 5], ["tl;dr not too shabby! but you can do so much better.\n\nCame here for my birthday with a few gal pals - we'd been meaning to try the place out for ages.

After their food was once again edible, I tried some and wasn't impressed. The Pappardelle tasted undercooked and was plated in a lasagna style making it difficult to cut through, and the ragu itself was mediocre at best in terms of flavour. The Malfalde was gooey in consistency and I personally found the truffle cream sauce to be overpowering and not complimentary to this dish. Upon her first bite my friend immediately noted that the dish tasted exactly the same as the mushroom pasta at Trattoria Nervosa (a sister restaurant to Gusto). \n\nAs a fan of the other restaurants under the Gusto54 umbrella corporation (Chubby's & PAI in particular) I was a little disappointed that their Italian dining experience didn't live up to the standards I would have expected from a place with such high reviews. \n\n\nSometimes ordering can be a hit or miss, and these were most definitely a miss.

I wish the portions were bigger though for the $22 I had to pay!\n\nThey have their own house wine on tap for $1 per ounce!

I ordered the Mushroom and Truffle pasta, boyfriend got the T Bone steak, and we had the beef tartare as our app. \n\nDrinks were so so good, I got the dragon fruit and watermelon cocktail and it tasted like juice but I could taste just the subtle flavour of hard liquor. \n\nPasta was perfectly aldente and so much mushroom and truffle flavour, it brought me back to the truffle pasta I had in Florence. T Bone was great, flavour was really good and the addition of mushrooms was a nice touch to balance the strong flavour of steak. Beef tartare was surprisingly delicious, there was a truffle infused sauce that you could mix the beef with and place it on the baguette chip and not was that heavenly. \n\nCome here if you're looking for great Italian food and cozy vibes.", 4], ["Great place for dinner! Casual atmosphere with really great food! \n\nWe sat in the patio area and had a few of their dishes. We had the cacio e pepe, tomahawk steak, margherita pizza, broccolini, and their rucola salad. Everything was really good! The steak was cooked perfectly, nice and tender. The rucola salad was fresh and love the dressing on it. Finished off with tiramisu and panna cotta... both very good. \n\nThe service was really good and they have a nice wine menu. Would love to go back to try some other things on the menu.", 4], ["I ordered a cappuccino with lenticchie while my friend ordered the mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta. I sampled her food as well so I will share my thoughts.\n\nCappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.\n\nMushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!\n\nServers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta.", 3], ["First time at gusto 101, I heard so much good things about its dinner menu so I had also pretty high expectations on the brunch too. I would say it's a little overpriced for the food I was eating, we tried eggs in purgatorio, and tagiliata di manzo which is grilled flatiron steak and Romano beans. I never liked beans but liked the beans oN my plate, it's well seasoned and not mushy. However I asked for medium steak and I got fully cooked steak...... which is just, disappointed considering how popular this restaurant is. The tiramisu is very sweet, they charge 10 dollars for a very shallow piece, and the biscuits underneath is no where near soaked, maybe they took a modern twist on this dessert because it is NOT authentic at all. For those who recommended tiramisu in the reviews, I don't know if u actually have eaten authentic ones yet because this is just..... meh.Anyways, I will come back for non brunch, but I will avoid tiramisu for good.", 4], ["Came here for the fresh pizza, straight out of the oven. We devoured it within minutes, about $13-15 for a pizza. We came here as a snack, if you're coming for a meal - a pizza per person would be more ideal instead of to split. Tasted very similar to NYC brick oven pizza.", 5], ["Ahh! Confused to rate between 4 & 3 . I would rather say 3.5. And here's how:\n\nService: 5 plus. One of the best services I have ever received. I booked them online and had specified a lot of things. I tend to do that all the tome when they ask. But... I have seen a few restaurants which actually read or pay attention to those instructions and follow, but the Gusto 101, not only each of them carefully but also showed that they care by accommodating each of my request and showcasing it while we were onsite. Example: I mentioned that I am pregnant and vegetarian, so the lady who served us, without asking told whats vegetarian and safe to eat in pregnancy!!! I was so impressed!!! She also remembered that its my Hubby's birthday and she connected to me finding a time when he was on a toilet trip to do a little candle ceremony over the dessert to totally surprise him. I didn't have to approach her.\nApart from it, in general the service was par excellence. So weather its serving the food, special requests, refills and making sure someone is looking for us all the time we never had to wait to get the attention. They were more than 1 people watching for us.\n\nAmbiance: 5 - we did dine @ upstairs patio, and it was beautiful! The place is super big, they also have a beautiful private party room un the basement, wine cellar themed. \n\nFood: 3 - so here is where I think  they have a little room for improvement or it was just by chance that our dish was not so good. Can't say. So we ordered mushroom pasta : the sauce tasted so awesome but the downside: there was a very little sauce and the pasta was a little more harder than Al-dente. Portion could be a little more as well.\nI did snoop around and saw , other people had more sauce . So I don't know.  \nPizza was good not the best but nothing wrong. \nThe bread (3.99$) was good. The dessert was average although i loved the salt and chocolate combinations but it was-not balanced somewhere the salt was a little to much, I guess they have to be more careful while they sprinkle it or find another way to serve it. \nHubby loved both of their house wines ( red & white) and the idea of 1$ per Oz. And they made me Virgin Mojito and priced it pretty decent! \n\nI must it is great place for personal celebrations and special dates.\nBut we are willing to go again to give it try a second time.", 3], ["This restaurant is a go-to of mine that I can always count on. They serve up tried and true dishes that always taste delicious and are filled with flavour! \n\nBe aware, wait times can be pretty long at this spot. It is not uncommon to be told that you will have to wait 45 mins at the door. I suggest getting here before the dinner buzz comes in (and I promise it's worth it). The atmosphere is lively, the restaurant is industrial chic, and the service is impeccable. \n\nAs most will note, the mafalde ai funghi is a must try. The truffle cream sauce is to die for. You can't go wrong with this signature dish. Another favourite of mine is the prosciutto e rucola. This pizza is the perfect blend of ingredients. And don't forget to share the burrata as a starter! This creamy delectable cheese will make you feel like you are truly in Italy. \n\n10/10 spot. Will be coming back again soon.", 5], ["Fresh fish, quality pasta and an above average cup of espresso make this livley Italian restaraunt the place to be if you are near the core. \n\nWe arrived as a group of six and were quickly seated.  The service was up to standard for the area; quick, consistent and attentive.  As a side note, the gratuity for a group that size is included.\n\nThe layout of high ceiling, exposed brick walls and an open-concept kitchen is fun (if not overplayed ).  At \n1:00pm the restaraunt seemed to be packed with young professionals catching up with old friends.  It's lively and a little loud (in a good way).\n\nWe shared a number of dishes.  I tried the Mafalde Funghi pasta (mushrooms), a Margarita Pizza, a Branzino (fish and oh so good) and the Cavolo Nero salad. The food ranged from good to excellent.\n\nThe salad was remarkably refreshing and had a good balance of flavours.  The pasta was savory and filling and the pizza was above average if not amazing.\n\nThe Branzino looked to be grilled with some olive oil and served on a small bed of veggies.  It was nice and simple.\n\nFor dessert I had cannoli and a double espresso.   The coffee was rich and had a distinct flavour (befitting of any self-respecting Italian restaurant).  The cannoli could have been better.  The cream cheese filling just doesn't measure up to the rest of the meal. \n\nWill definately come back to Gusto next time I am in the area or to catch up with an old friend.", 4], ["We arrived on time for our Monday 11:30am reservation - party of 7. At around noon, the restaurant was PACKED (mostly working professionals) - and rightfully so! Food, service, and vibe were all 5 stars in my book.\n\nWe went a little overboard with the apps for the table: \n* house-baked foccacia bread bucket x 2 - seriously addicting, but would taste even better if it was complimentary :P\n* burrata served with sweet heirloom tomatoes and fragrant olive oil\n* mushroom bruschetta (one per person) - MUST-GET!! cheesy, crunchy, and full of umami flavor\n\nFor entrees, most of us ordered the signature pasta dish: truffle funghi, which was creamy, indulgent, and perfect for carb-lovers. Portion was generous, so I'd recommend sharing esp. if you plan to go ham on the starters like we did.\n\nService was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. For example, they were able to serve 7 pieces of bruschetta even when standard order came in 3 pieces. We had a complicated check split request, and they showed no qualms about it. I'm looking forward to carb-loading here again the next time I'm in town.", 5], ["The restaurant has a unique, authentic feel to it with wooden tables and decor. I would recommend the 2nd floor during the day, as it is much brighter with the sun roof and light coming in. We ordered the margherita pizza and fungi pasta. This is my first time trying mushroom and truffle pasta, and it tasted amazing! It smelled heavenly, and it was rich and creamy which I love. Well worth the trip!", 4], ["Came here for brunch and were seated at the upper level which was gorgeous on a sunny day. Seriously needed shades.\n\nI had the EGGS IN PURGATORIO, which was great. Not as heavy as most brunches tend to be. Couldn't finish the last (third) piece of bread, so much food!\n\nShared the nutella pancake (I believe? can't see it on current menu but it was BOMB) and that was the best life decision I made that day.", 4], ["Greet by the friendliest host ever then smells delicious food all around. Food was really good! The beef tartar with truffles butter and you must order bruschetta! It's the best that I've ever had, warmly toasted to crunchy, topped with saut\u00e9 mushrooms full of flavour and covered with melting cheese! Don't know what that cheese called, but it was full of buttery characters! The truffle cream sauce pasta is another must other! Like don't ask question, just order it and you will feel it! Pizza was great, again the cheese game in this restaurant is top notch; however I prefer more soft and tensity/chewy dough. But will have to come back for the drinks and other delci", 4], ["Delicious. Great wine selection 0.009 demerit because you have to cut the pizza yourself with a steak knife which seems counter productive and you end up ripping the crust and it's a mess.", 5], ["Been frequenting Gusto for a few years now and I'm never disappointed!

Buon appetito!", 5], ["Came here at 5pm on a weekday and it was already quite busy! No reservation needed at least. Atmosphere was super cozy and nice - perfect for a  cold evening. My friend commented that the upstairs is even better but it wasn't open when we were there. We shared the Brussels sprouts to start which were delicious. I think these would be enjoyed by anyone ! For my entree, I chose the pumpkin ravioli which was excellent - the right amount of decadence and the perfect portion size. The great thing about this place as well is you can choose the amount of ounces of wine you would like. Lastly, our server was great - attentive but also gave us enough space to chat and didn't make us feel rushed. Overall great time!", 4], ["3.5 stars. Great place to hang out with friends. Food is average. \n\nWhat to do here: Make reservation at the roof top patio (on a warm day) to hang out with a group of friends.

I am a little bit picky when it comes to cocktail and the bartenders made them exactly the way I wanted (I requested a few changes) \n\nThe food is good but I am not a big pasta lover therefore I had mostly appetizers. The kale salad is great and I had the cheese plate with it, which is awesome too. I just wish there was a few more vegetarian and lower carbs options on the menu but this is asking for a lot!", 4], ["This place is great! \nIt was busy on a Tuesday night but the staff were attentive and friendly. My friend and I enjoyed the atmosphere on the rooftop terrace where the roof had been opened so we could enjoy the sublime summer weather. \nI enjoyed a wonderful pasta, the Bucatini Amatriciana to be exact. The sauce was scarce but the flavour was full. My friend had a pizza and said that it was light yet satisfying.\nI finished with dessert, who can pass up an icecream sandwich?! It certainly didn't disappoint the coconut not over powering the dark chocolate pieces and the warm brioche bun that wasn't oily. \nI'd recommend Gusto 101 to anyone.", 5], ["i come here strictly for the mafalde as i'm sure many do! it's a guilty pleasure, as i'm obsessed with with anything truffle. i am always satisfied and honestly will probably never get sick of it. the kale ceasar is also perfect to balance out the pasta i indulge in. i have had the appetizer platter once and honestly it was underwhelming - we didn't finish it at all. the pizza is good as well, i just never really order anything when i come, i already know! oh and the fresh bread here was always something to look forward to when waiting for our food. however,  they started charging for it which is an absolute bummer! regardless, i always recommended gusto, it's one of my top 5 places in Toronto.", 5], ["I enjoyed Gusto 101's upstairs patio twice in the summer.

Worth the wait.", 4], ["I love Gusto!  Especially their mushroom truffle pasta which is their specialty!  The staff and management is great and ensure you have a positive experience.

Anytime after 6 will be first come first serve.", 5], ["My home away from home. With house wine being $1 an ounce, Gusto will knock your cell phone right out of your hand as you're instagramming the best mushroom pasta in the city.  Enjoy eating at a table or sit at the bar to be closer to the wine and enjoy watching the bartenders create lovely libations.

They were kind enough to not only factor in an accommodation I asked for via the application on two occasions, but also call me to confirm what I'd asked for. They prepared their calamarata con gamberi senza gamberi the first time, because I'm vegetarian, and I loved the calamarata; they even asked for my choice of pasta during our second phone call, resulting in my having a wonderful bucatini that seemed to be made from scratch, held sauce well, and was beautifully al dente. Finally, they offered to add a simple pomodoro to their menu, which I'll definitely order from now on. As a business owner myself, I so appreciate it when people go out of their way to accommodate their customers - it can really make a person's day. Thank you, Gusto 101, I'll definitely be back!", 5], ["Just had the worst restaurant meal I've ever had in a restaurant in Toronto and currently am making myself lunch after barely being able to eat the soggy brunch I was served. The previous reviews on here about the food being extremely underwheliming, with a nice venue sum up my experience at Gusto. \n\nFood \n\nLets start with the food. I ordered the Omelette from the Brunch menu, which is an Omelette with spinach, cheese and mushrooms with Kale salad and potatoes. The Omelette was extremely soggy, and when I cut into it just with my fork, all the toppings fell out of it. I made an attempt to get the toppings and egg together, when I tasted the egg and toppings the spinach tasted like mush, the eggs were soggy and the mushrooms were rubbery. \n\nAfter two bites of this \"Omelette\" I decided to move on to the Kale salad, which was extremely salty and also soggy, it tasted like over cooked seaweed. I then tried some of the potatoes. The skins on the outside were overcooked and fell off the potato, leaving behind the dry pasty, unspiced inside of the potato. The only thing that made the potatoes salvageable was the fact that my boyfriend ordered a dish with a chickpea pure sauce that I could dip the dry potatoes in. \n\nService \n\nThe service was very mediocre. One of the other guests at the table politely asked the server if she could have the dressing on her Kale salad on the side and was told no, because the dressing is massaged into the Kale and that is how the chef serves it. Gusto also cannot accommodate those with dairy allergies who would like to enjoy a coffee with their brunch. They do not have soy or almond milk or any kind of dairy substitute. \n\nAlso, if you have 6 or more guests be prepared to pay an automatic gratuity of 18%...based on this automatic gratuity for our group of 6, I would have expected a higher level of service and the ability to order your food the way you want it ex. dressing on the side. \n\nVenue\n\nThis is the only aspect of the dining experience that bumps it up from a 1 star to a 2 star review. I sat on the roof top, which offers an open concept, high ceiling glass enclosure with exposed brick and a rustic feeling. However, the venue does not justify a soggy, underwheliming, lack lustre brunch, which prompted me to make my own lunch when I got home. \n\nOverall, after having Gusto's brunch, I would pick McDonald's all-day breakfast menu over coming here....which is a pretty low bar. There are much better Italian or brunch restaurants in the city in terms of quality of the food you should consider over Gusto.", 2], ["Any place you can buy wine by the ounce is my kind of place!! The kale salad is so yum and the bar is a great place to mee people in the neighborhood.", 5], ["First time coming to Toronto and my friends friend recommended this place. It was good and different. We got there on a Saturday at 6pm. No line, no wait. But man after we sat down, by 7-8pm there was a long line! The servers are very friendly and the food was good. I'm not a wine drinker but I did get the wine by the Oz. They charged 1$ per Oz for their house wine!", 4], ["I will definitely recommend this to anyone! For a Tuesday it was pretty crowded. The don't take reservations and our waiting time was 30 minutes but they probably called in 10. The service was good but the food was outstanding. The Tapas were all great! The only downfall was that it was pretty crowded and loud. You could barely speak and it was easier to hear the people at others tables instead of yours.", 4], ["Rol San is an average looking Chinese restaurant with extraordinary food. Just don't walk in expecting a Michelin star decor. The dim sum choice is vast - you select what you want and mark it on the ordering sheet. The service is fast and staff efficient.\nWent in a larger group and tried almost all the dim sums on offer. Liked seafood and shrimp-pork the best. Short ribs was insane. It's served in a black pepper sauce and carries a punch. \n\nGive it a try when you are in Kensington. They are open until 4 AM on weekends.", 4], ["We've had a reasonable variety of their dim sum and regular menu offerings on several occasions and are underwhelmed.

Overall, each Rol San experience is disappointing.", 2], ["Stumbled into this place while strolling with my family in Toronto Chinatown. It was my birthday, so we spontaneously decided to treat me to some dim sum.\n\nAs others point out, the dim sum is served all day, but that didn't stop aficionados from queuing up just before it opened on Monday morning.\n\nThe dim sum is solid. It wasn't the best but it was far from the worst.

I recently had dim sum at this place again, food quality is really poor.  Skin for ha gow is very soggy.  Other dishs are either too salty or bland.

Though nothing was confirmed, it made me want to visit the restaurant for dim sum as I was in the mood for some nostalgia.\n\nThere was no line up when we arrived so we were immediately seated in the back area of the restaurant. Dim sum is ordered via paper and not carts which some places have. The options for dim sum here covers most of the staples which I usually order (no egg tarts though) so the only limitation was how much I could fit in my belly.\nWe ordered a wide variety of items such as siu mai, BBQ pork buns, rice rolls, and beef balls among others. I do not recall a single item which I did not enjoy and overall the quality of the dim sum here is solid.\n\nI have been to Rol San for dinner as well and the dishes I ordered were done well. Overall my experience with the food here has been good and I do not have anything bad to say about it. \n\nService here has generally been good as the staff has been responsive when we needed anything and are fairly polite.\nIn terms of the space, there is a lot of seating with two sections of tables in the restaurant and both sections are bright and comfortable.\n\nAll in all, I find Rol San to be a good choice for food in the area especially for dim sum. I have yet to be disappointed with an experience here so I would wholeheartedly recommend this place.", 4], ["Rol San makes it among my top favorite dim sum restaurants. While I've only had the chance to go once so far, the dim sum there blew me away. Unlike other dim sum places, they don't do carts here. instead you fill out which dishes you want on a form. As such if you're not someone who's super familiar with dim sum and doesn't know the dishes by name/description, this place may not be the best place for you. However if you are a dim sum veteran, you'll enjoy the fact that all the dishes are made to order ensuring that the food is hot and steaming by the time it comes to your table. \n\nRol San has a ton of variety for dishes. My party probably got 8-10 different dishes when we ate here. Everything was good but some dishes that really stood out to me were their har gao, chicken feet, and spare ribs. Their har gao has a thin skin without being mushy and has the right amount of filling which are common issues I've had with other dim sum places. The chicken feet and spare ribs both were seasoned well/were made in flavorful sauces. Overall I'd recommend Rol San to anyone looking to get dim sum in Toronto.", 5], ["We were all craving dim sum and knew it was what we wanted on our rainy Toronto journey. Our fellow Yelpers led us here to this popular spot in Chinatown and it was a really solid choice.\n\nOur table of five got seated rather quickly even an hour into their weekend opening time. Dim sum here is ordered and delivered instead of the traditional steam carts rolling around. Since we're from the States, all the prices at Rol San seemed lesser than most places like San Francisco or LA = big win!\n\nI always end up ordering the same items at dim sum restaurants to judge their quality and felt the selection here was on point. The siu mai and har gow were both juicy, and definitely more on the larger side. The chern fun (rice rolls) were good but they didn't cut them for us which made it difficult to share. Everything we ordered was good and overall helped to settle our cravings.\n\nService here was not bad either especially for busy dim sum restaurants. While we kept asking them for glasses of water, they turned over our tea quickly each time.

The waiting wasn't too bad, however we were given the option of sharing a table with two other parties at a large round table to expedite our wait time. THIS WAS A BAD DECISION ON MY PART.

BBQ Pork fried rice, sweet and sour pork and garlic snow pea leaves is from the menu book. \n\nPretty standard food. The food came out fast, (around 7 mins) after we handed our sheets to the staff there. Food comes in large portions, so it is best when you have a big group, so you can all share. Squid Tentacle, fried evenly and it was really juicy. The snow pea leaves was not overly cooked (but it did have a lot of oil). BBQ fried rice was good but there  wasn't much flavor to it. Sweet and sour pork wasn't bad except it was a little over sauced, as we ate to the bottom of the dish (but it can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it). Black Sesame balls was great except there was only a quarter of black sesame paste in the dough (be careful: its hot and spills easily).\n\nWe asked for the bill, and it came with fortune cookies.\nNote that only accept Cash or Visa Card. \n\nOverall it is definitely a restaurant you want to visit when you crave Chinese food at 1am.\n\nThank you to all the staffs at Rol San for their hard work.", 4], ["Dim sum is dim sum is sim sum really.

I do prefer the ones where they come around with carts though. \n\nFunniest part was walking to the back part of the restaurant (I'd say 2/5ths I'm in the front and 3/5ths in the back you walk by the washrooms. Once we were seated I decided to visit them before lunch. When you open the door you're staring at the urinals so everyone walking by is staring right at whoever's going the bathroom.

It's Friday night we hadn't been out in months, it was absolutely amazing food. But the best were the dumplings, huge dumplings and delicious. Next time we go we are just going to dumplings, we had no idea that they specialize in dumplings. They have it advertised but we were too hungry.

With that said the dim sum is just fine. Reasonable selection that you order off a sheet. No carts. Fine with that. What I'm totally NOT fine with is a place in a major world city that does not accept Mastercard. Seriously?!? My wife and I ate quite a bit and when we settled they dropped that bomb on us. I am traveling so I go light - one credit card and just enough cash to get a coffee. So, I was told to go to an ATM...I did not bring my card. This was a terribly inconvenient way to end an ok dinner. I should also add that they accepted my Mastercard last year so I'm not sure what happened. With as much business as they do they should eat any small fee to make it convenient for those of us visiting.", 2], ["My favourite dim sum place in Chinatown. Other places have soggy har gau and siu mai. The decor is decent except for the plastic patio chairs they use at the tables. The price of dim sum is mid range and definitely not too overpriced.

Everyone started staring and shaking their heads at us, we also noticed on our way out the waiter was already arguing with another customer about their bill. Our bill was settled and we left, upon arriving home we decided to recalculate our meal considering that we paid $165 after tax and tips, it seemed very high. We soon discovered that we were overcharged and our bill should've come up to $110 after tax.

When people were done eating the waiters would come around and just take the 4 corner from the sheet and remove all the plates everything at once! Quick turnover. Never saw that before.\n\nAt the table there's a sheet of paper where you make your selection of how many of each thing you'd like. They start you with tea for $0.60 per person if you wish - it was delicious. We ordered 5 or 6 things. I remember the pork buns - yum! Also the pork dumplings were very good. I didn't like the short ribs - those were a little gluey, but had a good flavor. We got these rice ball things covered in seeds for desert - those were filled with black bean, absolutely delicious!

The prices are very reasonable, 57 CAD for four hungry rugby players is very good.\n\nEach of the 11 dishes we had were flavorful and hot, and the hot sauce was a big hit as well. In particular, we enjoyed the pork sticky rice, the shrimp dumpling, and the pumpkin dumpling for dessert. \n\n-1 star because, as a dumb American, it was hard to order from the card without pictures or knowing more about what each item was.

When we asked for extra plates and chopsticks, they would give us one less than we needed, and it would take them at least 10 minutes before they would give us another one. When we asked for the bill, we held up our credit card to gesture that we needed the machine, but one of the waitresses came and wordlessly took our bill away (without the credit card), walked around in a circle, and then gave it back to us for no reason with no explanation. \n\nGiven the poor service, my friend and I decided that they were not deserving of a tip so we simply paid the full amount for the meal. The lady who gave us the machine noticed, and then proceeded to harass us loudly in Mandarin about why we didn't tip and if we were planning to tip using cash or credit. My friend and I were so shocked that she had the audacity to call us out on it that we didn't say anything. She then left and we got up to leave quickly. My friend walked out first and I began to follow her, but the same lady stopped me in my path and wouldn't let me leave until I paid tip. All I had in cash with me was $1.50, so I put it on the table, but she screamed at me that it wasn't enough and asked to see my credit card. When I took it out, she grabbed it out of my hands, took it to the machine, and inputted a tip amount for me without even letting me choose how much I wanted to tip. By then, she had already caused a scene in front of the entire restaurant by yelling at me so aggressively that other customers began to turn around and stare. She wouldn't let us leave without paying tip, so eventually I paid and left without a word.\n\nWhile walking home, fuming about our horrible experience, we checked to see if the take-out we got was the correct order. It was not. We specifically requested shrimp dumplings by marking it on the paper, but they gave us Tsui Mai. \n\nDo not waste your time here. While the actual food is good, the staff clearly does not respect their customers and they have no problems with using verbal harassment to get what they want.

The pot pie definitely had a nice flavor, though I was a little disappointed about the lack of meat on the dish. That being said, the attention to ingredients and the way everything blended together taste-wise was quite remarkable. The one downfall of the dish is that they put the pie crust on the bottom, but it is probably more suited to go on top since it is more flaky pastry dough that ends up getting soggy under the gravy.\n\nOverall, this place is quite expensive, but the quality of the service and ambiance are fitting.

Only the \"bacon and eggs\" app blew us away with a wonderful marriage of mellowness from the egg component and bold flavours from the \"bacon\" and onions (dish not on regular menu). Everything else was a bit of a blur after a couple of days so I felt the food left so much more to be desired.\nI also felt slightly uncomfortable dining here, since the restaurant seemed filled with business executives and the wealthy.

But, during one of the hottest days that Toronto has witnessed in recent history, all the windows were wide open causing a patron behind us to complain, not infrequently about the air conditioning.  I did not find it unbearable, but thought that those who wanted fresh air were likely to have chosen the beautiful patio which was open.\n\nI started breakfast with a grapefruit half.  Pretty standard fare here...no garnish, just a grapefruit  set within an indented plate.  This was followed by yogurt with granola.  The granola was very good...perhaps made in-house.  The French Toast  was lack luster although the menu indicated it was brioche bread.  The entire meal took almost two hours!\n\nThe servers did not come by very much.

We didn't buy it being 20 oz bone-in rib eye. It didn't look anywhere near that size. The side dishes were mixed. Bok Choy wasn't great, chived potatoes were fine as were the mushrooms.

We looked closely at the bill since it was the highest we ever spent and we saw an error. The items didn't add up to the total. I checked and later 2 other members of my party checked. It didn't add up. We were upset that they are having bills that don't add up. We told the waitress and eventually the manager came over. He said some lame excuse about one of our items not being on the bill but yet was in the total. Made no sense why it didn't show up listed in the items. He offered us NOTHING. We felt that was wrong so he gave us a whole $6 off the bill. Yes, I mean SIX dollars. He wouldn't budge on the amount. Finally he said he would throw in some cookies and cheese cake. He ended up putting in cookies that don't look great and none of us ordered cookies for dessert, as he knew. He threw in one slice of the cheese cake for ruining it for 4 people.

The ravioli with sweet pea and mascarpone, brown butter, summer truffle and Pecorino Romano was rich and luscious. The black cod with miso glaze and ginger butter sauce was perfectly cooked -- flaky, delicate with a savory miso crust.

Everyone else was cheerful and competent from the get-go, without being smarmy/vapid. {OUR ACCIDENTAL VISIT: Since we were going for an early dinner, we decided after canceling that rez to walk around Yorkville and see what looked good.  We came across a patio with many happy diners - didn't notice the place's name - and  asked if they had a table for us even though we had no reservation.  The hostess - in a smashing dress which we said was designed for the restaurant when we noticed it on another hostess, too - said most of the patio was filled but they had 2 tables at the end on Hazelton that we could see, or we could sit inside.  We checked out the outside tables, both at the very end of the patio on the side street.  We LOVED the farthest - bigger than usual, with no nearby tables, and less car or foot traffic than in the front. She said it was where she sat movie stars.  (Joke?  Didn't matter.) True, it was (a) next to a bussing station so there was the occasional sound of crockery, and (b) the piped-to-the-outside - and unnecessary - music was a louder than we liked, but basically it was a fine table.  Then I looked at the menu and laughed, \"This is the place we just canceled because of the terrible reviews, bad service, cheating on the bill ...\"  My husband said, \"Well, it seems very popular.  Let's give it a try.\"}  FOOD:  We each had a glass of wine (good, but not particularly memorable, and then salads.  H had the kale ceasar.  Delicious.  Bits of bacon, a mild horseradish flavor, beautiful kale.  I had the heirloom carrot.  The carrots, although very pretty to look at with a nice grilled texture, were alas without flavor. The rest of the salad - the greens, avocado, pistachios, pickled golden raisins - were, however, fabulous.   We next shared a hamburger, cooked to our order, with good pickles and fries, and a side of sweet potato. The sweet potatoes were excellent, cooked perfectly, with sunflower seeds and a bit of creamy dressing which tasted lovely and was nicely decorative but was unnecessary to us.  We were going just to have coffee after that but read the dessert menu and when we saw that we could get a scoop of Ontario Strawberry sorbet for $3, we ordered it. Utterly delicious.  I don't usually bother to write reviews - and always am suspicious of good reviews following bad ones, esp. on yelp - but just had to speak up on this one.

The rice and peas however held way too much water and were almost mushy-like in texture (but not mushy enough to be inedible).

I guess I shouldn't be eating jerk chicken if I'm so concerned about my health, but the amount of oil that they used here was unusual and excessive compared to other jerk joints I've been to.

I used to get this discount meal before but my off hours from work is at 5pm. \n\nThe regular price is about $8 + tax.

Let me elaborate.\n\nLocation:\nLocated in the west end of queen street, the place is small but well laid out. The decorations are also super cute and elaborate.\n\nGood:\nI haven't tried anything but the manaeesh and they're on point! The labneh specifically is tangy and rich and goes perfectly with the Zaatar. The dough itself is the right level of thickness for my liking, perfectly balancing between chewiness and crispness.\n\nService:\nOur server was very nice and friendly and helped us pick the best selling items.\n\nOverall, great place.

They just shrugged and pointed at the menu on the wall which showed the size of the flatbreads... \n\nI ordered the Sujuk and Lebneh. They came out very quickly but I felt they were too underdone...I was quite surprised when I saw them. I wished they had some more color. The Sujuk was tasty but could have used more spice and kick.

Zaatar with tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh mint\n2. Spinach and halloumi\n3. Akawi cheese\nThe dough is perfect - perfect thickness and has a great chew.

Comes with different toppings/spreads that is inside the flatbread. \n\nPerfect for a snack, breakfast, dinner or lunch, you can get it with cheese, meat or veggies. I personally think if you're a big eater, you'll need two flatbreads to fill you up. I think the Manaeesh is definitely a great snack option though. \n\nThe flatbreads are made to order and they have a big oven in the back to make it. I ordered the cheese and meat option and the eggplant option. Both taste distinctly from each other, and I really like the moist inside yet crunchy outside of the flatbreads. For a more satisfying experience of the Manaeesh, I suggest adding additional toppings to make it a fuller meal. \n\nThe flatbreads are part of the Syrian cuisine, so it's definitely worth a try. I suggest coming in if you're looking for a snack mid afternoon to see if you like it. \n\nLAST TIP?!\n\nThere's a mix of vegetarian and meat options however there is only beef or egg option for meats.

Examples:  cheese, thyme, sesame seeds, olives, spinach, pomegranate molasses, walnuts, eggplant, beef, mint. Choose from one of the recommended options, or create your own.

Knafeh - delicately flavored filling (either cheese, cashew cheese, or caramel-banana-tahini), topped with phyllo and drizzled with orange blossom syrup. Gah so good.\n3. Plenty of vegan options, as well as whole wheat flatbread.\n4. Cheerful, helpful, knowledgeable staff, which is excellent when you're choosing from a menu of options you have never heard of and cannot pronounce.\n\nI can see why Soufi's was featured in the New York Times; if I had a newspaper, it's pretty much all I would write about.", 4], ["We happened to be walking on Queen West when we decided to have some snacks.

Above all else, the Manaeesh is held together by the quality of its bread - and Soufi's was certainly good. The fresh flatbread is characterized by its soft interior and chewy exterior, and Soufi's was no exception.\n\nI have always found labneh to be one of the more compelling ingredients in Arab cuisine. It is often used as a bold flavour - in that it adds a distinctive sour flavour to anything it's a part of. It works great in a the context of savory foods as well, and the zaatar, a spice which stands behind the the labneh's star in all its nutty and slightly tangy glory, complements it extremely well. \n\nSoufi's does all this well. Definitely worth a visit.", 4], ["I had high hopes for this place but was unfortunately very disappointed!

Nothing wrong with being an Uber driver but to guess that simply because my friend is brown is very problematic. Perhaps the staff there could benefit from a training on unconscious bias/prejudices. \n\nThen their \"fresh\" \"cold pressed\" celery juice is not actually fresh as it was served from the juice that was made the night before and kept in the fridge (this is what we were told). When we asked why this $12 drink (yes, $12!!!) wasn't fresh, the person there became SO rude and dismissive. \n\nSo...I know servers have bad days and let's hope that's what this was but it doesn't really make me want to visit again.", 3], ["Paid almost $7 for a soup only to later find out it was a canned soup.

I eat one while I'm sitting down waiting for my smoothie bowl and the other later in the day. It's so frigging delicious. One time the manager told me the cookie was an older menu item that they just brought back after some time of it being off menu... that was the craziest shizz I heard at 9:30 AM. It's soooo good. I'm talking healthy, protein-packed, delicious, hard yet soft, sweet with NO REFINED SUGAR cookie from heaven. If you write a crappy review of this place, chances are YOU DIDN'T TRY THIS COOKIE. Get on my level, order this cookie, and update your review. \n\nThe Smoothie Bowls are also super delicious and a must order. My go to's are:\n\nThe Breakfast Chocolate Bowl, Peanut Butter Protein Bowl, and The Vanilla Peanut Butter Protein Bowl. These three make me extremely happy, taste AMAZING, and made me a return customer. The consistency is perfect, never watery like soup; I'm talking thick, ain't going to drip off your spoon, serious smoothie bowl, AND the toppings are what probably make me order these all time. \n\n*Side Note* I have been let down two times with the inconsistencies of bowl toppings... I don't know if it was an employee error or if they ran out of specific toppings, but FUEL+, I look forward to those almonds and pumpkin seeds on my bowl!!! Don't do me wrong next time! \n\nI've also had Mango Avacado Bowl (very tropical tasting, and I'd consider ordering this more in the Summertime) and the Acai Berry Bowl (also okay... maybe if there were fresh strawberries cut on top, I'd order this again) which were good, just not my favourite standouts. The Breakfast Chocolate Bowl, Peanut Butter Protein Bowl, and The Vanilla Peanut Butter Protein Bowl are too good to pass up when you've been off sugar for six days.\n\nThe Kombucha is good but I found it a little sweet for my liking, the Real Lemonade was AMAZING and you can control the sweetness (!!!!), the Ginger Chai Latte was really good (personally, I love to drink this in Fall), and the Fuel Balls are also good and remind me of healthy vegan timbits.\n\nI always find the staff here to be super friendly, wonderful to chat with, and happy to be at work, I love that there's free Wifi, AND they have the BEST people watching table right in front of the window looking out on Church St.\n\nI love supporting this local business and you will too if you take my recommendations! \n\nOH, the Lemon Ginger shot is my #1 go to when I feel a cold coming on and I'm too lazy to juice lemon and ginger at home.

I'm not allergic, and I like bananas so no big deal for me). I liked the crunchiness of the shredded coconut and the nuttiness of the flax seeds. The ingredient combination was great. The bowl was on the small side though. Much smaller than I expected.\n\nMy husband had the pomegranate berry dream smoothie $6.99. I had a taste and it was good. It's much smaller than you'd get at Booster Juice or Jugo Juice though. \n\nThe salads and sandwiches there are pre-packaged. We didn't have any.

I have yet to try it, along with their large selection of shakes. \n\nJust to give you a sense of the owner's niceness, here's a little story. My girlfriend and I were due for a catch up date so we walked 2 blocks to Fuel+ in the pouring rain, which by the time we got there turned into a humid, rainless, scorching hot summer day. I assume the owners saw us melting in the sun, (our choice to sit in the sun of course) and whipped up a decent sample size of a refreshing virgin mojito, on the spot, and doled them out, free of charge, to the 4 people that sat in the coffee bar that day.

You can choose to \"brunchify\" the tacos, to include potatoes, salad, and fruits. The salad contains a good mix of various greens, carrots, and beets, with vinaigrette dressing.

To be honest, when my friend and I went in, we had no idea what fry bread was and while it did sound enticing, we decided to play it safe and ordered the corn pancakes and was a little simple and nothing out of the ordinary. Not a lot of corn, very simple dish and a little bland. The people beside us ordered the frybread dishes and looked amazing, which we wish we wouldve ordered at the time but just didnt want to add anything else to our dish was we werent that hungry to begin with.

Meatloaf sounds  as cringey to me as people find the word moist does. This meatloaf was superb in texture and flavours.

In our case, the toppings was a delicious chowder, salmon, sprouts & cute little gold fish crackers...that SEAFOOD TACO was amazing!!\n\nWe also got their FRIED PERCH (special of the day) and the DUCK EGG & WAFFLE breakfast.

Otherwise all the dishes included a refreshing side salad, fruits, and home-fries which were still fluffy on the inside and pan-crusted to be crispy on the outside!\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back JUST for their Ojibway-tacos.

It did taste good but nothing to rave about. Perhaps more salmon would have been nice.\nTacos were good too. The bread had slight sweetness to it and wasn't too greasy considering it was fried. However all the toppings, etc combined, it is a hearty meal. In my opinion, the traditional is the best.

In fact, a lot here past the dish screams hipster. We tried the curry leaf chicken taco and I must say that we were really blown away by it! Instead of a tortilla, they served up a fry-bread. Surprisingly, it was neither soggy due to oil, or too crispy. The mango chutney was homemade right before our eyes and the presentation was exceptional. The chicken was filled with flavor that paired really well with the chutney. In fact, everything just tied well together so well. In addition to this, we had a good time conversing with the chef.

It's well loved (bordering on worn through lovingly) and tight.  Like TTC King St cramped where you're afraid to move an inch and then be tagged for inappropriate touching.  It's part of its charm but be aware... don't come here if you have more than 4 people.  Not because you can't but you're going to wait a LONG time and really, there's not a lot of room.  The bathroom reminds you out of a scene from a super old cottage out in the woods.  \n\nAs for service, absolutely loved it.  They're hilariously loving... you watch the chef, sous chef, and staff interact.  It's like watching a family but a hilariously loving and borderline dysfunctional family.

If every spot was like this, I bet you that Toronto dining scene would explode.\n\nEverything is cooked from scratch and right in front of you... literally cause the kitchen is in the dining area.  It's that tight.  Their menu is small but well curated with their Ojibway frybread being the heart of it.  They call it Taco ... I call it a mammoth amount of food sitting on top of a fluffy tasty bread.  Oh another thing, they actually do coffee right here.  Most places I regret choosing coffee for brunch but this one was actually good.  \n\nVegetarian Chilli 'Taco' - \"Taco\" ... its really a generous mountain of great food on their Ojibway frybread.  The crazy part of this brunch, it also comes with 2 eggs, salad, and home fries.  I asked for them to omit the egg cause I knew I wasn't going to finish.  The fries were heavily packed with flavour from the herbs.  And the chilli had some good heat in addition to spices.  Add in a pretty and healthy does of salad and you have my favourite type of brunch.  The fry bread is like a savoury yeast doughnut.  It was MASSIVE.  I couldn't finish.  4.5/5\n\nBrunch Platter - Between the duck bacon, venison sausage patty, smoked cheddar eggs, fry bread, salad, and home fries, this was an absolute feast.

Great price for the taste and love put into ti.  4.5/5\n\nI cannot write enough about the staff here... they MAKE this place amazing.

There is literally enough seating for about 12 people. However where they lack in space they more than make up for in flavours. The menu is creatively presented on wooden boards. They churn out brunch staples like eggs benny, corn pancakes, frittata, as well as meat and vegetarian chili and taco options from their small open kitchen. The cuisine draws upon Ojibway influences, which is apparent in the fry bread and perhaps some of the game meat such as venison or duck on the menu. \n\nI ordered the poached eggs and smoked salmon with goat cheese cream sauce over the Ojibway fry bread, served with salad and fruit. They had me at goat cheese! The fry bread had a delicious crunchy exterior but was cut open to reveal a softer brioche-like interior. The fry bread was a lovely vehicle for the delicious creamy goat cheese sauce, the eggs and the salmon. Unlike the thin, oily, rubbery commercially sold smoked salmon that you often find in supermarkets, the smoked salmon served here was thicker, firmer, meatier, and nicely portioned. The eggs were poached to my liking with a barely runny yolk center. Oh and those home fries! Biting into the crunchy seasoned exterior yields to soft pillowy potato interiors. Although the fry bread, potatoes and cream sauce were a little heavier texturally, the accompanying generous portion of salad and fruits helped to balance this out nicely. Initially I felt $16 was a bit pricey for what I would typically pay for lunch, but after eating there, I felt it is a fair price to pay for the portion of food served.\n\nI'm so glad I didn't write this place off based on a few unsuccessful attempts to dine here, as this was one of the more memorable brunch places I've been to in a long time!

It has always been one of my favourite Indian dishes and I like to see what each restaurant does with it.\n\nI have another rule: if mushrooms are offered on the menu in an Indian/Pakistani restaurant, it will be on my plate at least once.\n\nThis is of course a big thing for a restaurant to live up to and to do it well.\n\nThe restaurant was very clean, well staffed and offered a full bar.  Il not a drinker, but it's nice for people who drink.\n\nThe design is very well thought out and the staff were very courteous and helpful in helping me to find food that I can eat.  I must eat a gluten free diet and avoid several other foods, so finding a restaurant that caters this well to my diet is a win win.\n\nThe food is excellent.  The sauces are very vibrant and the portions very generous.  Good Indian food is as much about the dish as it is about the extra touches: a little extra ginger grated on top, the chef coming out asking if when I come back if he can make me a special bread because of my allergies.

Excellent!", 5], ["Dining here was a balance between eager conversation and culinary delight. My company was splendid and very knowledgeable about this type of cuisine. So I was not alone in my praise of the restaurant. The menu of \"Modern Indian\" was done properly.

We were supposed to have a reservation but they helped out and sat us at the bar. We ordered some drinks and a beer to bide some time. We ordered the chicken tiki masala and chicken vindaloo. We paired that with some garlic nan. So let's start out, the tiki masala was awesome just enough spice and the chicken was juicy, it was the perfect pair to dip the nan into. We ordered the vindaloo extra hot and boy they did deliver. Super spicy with a great citrus taste. We had that over rice and pees which was the perfect way to take a little bit of the sting off. For more modernistic Indian cuisine this place it top notch. The food is great in price and the portions and perfect, when I come back to the city I will definitely be back for round two and explore what else their great menu has to offer.

The dish came with 3 bite size fish pakoras, lentils, potatoes, naan, pappadum, shrimp malabar, rice, yogurt, salad and a choice of gulab jamun or rad malai for dessert. The server forgot to ask my choice and brought gulab jamun, but when I asked for ras malai, he brought me that and didn't exchange it. I got two desserts! \n\nThe lentils were a little salty for my taste, but I loved loved loved the shrimp. It's a perfect helping of 4-5 shrimp in a savoury tomato sauce. And the rice was so fragrant! The naans were perfectly tender and had a nice grilled flavour. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes, but that's not to say they weren't delicious. The gulab jamun was a healthy size and sweet! And the ras malai was liht, creamy, not too sweet, and generously showered with pistachios.

Pretty extensive menu, but vegans/dairy-intolerant people beware... almost every single dish and sauce has dairy! I ordered from the vegetarian menu, but had to ask the chef to omit dairy from the Mushroom Medley. The only 2 vegan mains are the cauliflower and the okra dishes. Vegan carbs is rice since all the naan breads are made with dairy. My vegetarian partner really enjoyed his dishes though! The rosemary naan was especially well liked. Our only criticisms about the food are that the mains were a tad too spicy and too oily. Overall the dishes are very similar in taste, quality, and selection to 259 Host.

Really just terrible. \n\nThe peas pullao had undercooked rice and frozen peas. The tadka daal was passable but quite spicy. The salad with sprouts and mango had everything in the world EXCEPT mango. It was just a weird salad.

Unfortunately it was not open when I was in the area, but they currently have a popup shop at Square One with the same quality and assortment of eclairs. \n\nI was disappointed lavender and honey was a limited edition flavor in the spring, but I took a chance on the Jarden Rouge because it was just so pretty, and I'm glad I did. It was a mixed summer berry cremeux with a miniature strawberry macaron and seasonal berries. I was a little nervous because I can't stand seeds but if there were any inside the \u00e9clair, I didn't notice them. It was creamy and decadent, and while it was smaller than I expected, it was filling.\n\nI think the price was reasonable. It's comparable to what you'd spend on a fine dessert at a restaurant, and this was definitely a fine dessert. The flavor and texture were wonderful, and even the miniature macaron was amazing. I thought it might be stale because it was a decoration, but it was the favorite of all the macarons I had during my stay even though strawberry isn't my favorite flavor.\n\nNugateau will definitely be a must-visit if I'm in Toronto again, and I'll recommend it to anyone who goes.", 5], ["On the box:\nA pastry, long in shape, but short in duration\n\nVery true.

The first time I came here, I pre-ordered six eclairs online, and wow, that (savoury) foie gras eclair was so worth it! The sweet eclairs were also as delicious as they were beautifully decorated. Some were decadent, and some were light.

They have new flavours for you to try out and both savory and sweet eclair options. The only downside about it is the price, I do find the price point to be quite high for one small dessert that isn't too filling. It is priced at about $7 or more depending on what you get but if the price isn't important to you, I would recommend you to visit at least once.", 4], ["This is one of my favorite Patisserie in Toronto mostly because of their creative Eclairs. \n\nNugateau's eclairs are not your traditional French eclairs with custard based fillings and fondant based. Their eclairs are much lighter and less sweeter compared to the rest.  Presentation wise they're also pretty and colourful that you can't even bring yourself to eat it lol.  \n\nThe eclair flavours changes everytime so if you tried something that you love, don't expect that this flavour will be there on your next visit.  My faves are the Pistache Royal, Romeo and Manjari.\n\nIn terms of price, I only buy these eclairs on special occasions or when I'm really craving for it.   People might think it's expensive but I don't mind paying $7 for an eclair if the quality/taste are on par with the eclairs we had in Paris.\n\nDefinitely worth trying at least one time!", 4], ["This place is a solid 3.5 in my books. \n\nWhile many reviews on here complain about the price point, I'm of the opinion that it's in line with how much work is involved, and with comparable dessert places serving cake. Additionally, let's not discount location impact on pricing and packaging, etc. \n\nIn terms of flavours, I love how creative they're getting, but given that it's an eclair shop, i'd love to see them showcase a simple classic eclair as well. There's nothing more bold than being able to show off how perfect you can make one thing. \n\nWhich really brings me to why this place is just shy of a 4 star or 5 star to me - it's the inconsistency in the pate a choux. We ordered 4 different eclairs, and all had a different consistency. One was perfect, one was dry, one had too much salt content, and the other stale. I suspect the issue here is two fold - 1) not moving product fast enough while probably only making one type of eclair on each day 2) having different pastry chefs working there without one main pastry chef overseeing quality. I'm not surprised - at only $7 a piece (relative to rent), they've got to turn profits and likely have a bit of a cut back in the kitchen. Unfortunately, it shows slightly. \n\nI will definitely be back, but i'll have to think twice before choosing this place over nadege for a dessert.", 3], ["I went to sq1 Mississauga and there was a holiday market inside the mall.

Had red velvet crumble topping and some lychee jelly in the middle. I really liked the toppings, the filling and the presentation. Bits of raspberries were in the middle which gave the eclair a refreshing taste. I didn't really like the pastry bread part of the eclair though. I thought it was rather dry and I envisioned it to be a bit softer on the bite and airy but it wasn't what I thought it was. If you don't bite the eclair with the filling, the bread part of the eclair is essentially tasteless or it tastes just like a regular pastry. \n\nLast tip?\n\nThey also offer cakes which can feed a good 4 ppl and it's delivered in a nice clear box.

I picked up the pistachio and coffee one. \n\nThe pistachio one comes covered in glittery green glaze on top. It was A LOT of glitter and really green in colour, mixed with the sticky and goopiness of the glaze it felt a bit like eating slime and not in a good way. The rest of the eclair was pretty good though, but I don't think it was worth the $6. The coffee one had great coffee flavour and had a more appetizing colour. \n\nIt all comes beautifully packaged in boxes with dividers for each eclair. I would come again if I was really in the mood for one or for a gift.", 3], ["This is probably the best eclairs I have ever had in my life.  All the flavour combinations were on point.  I particular love the raspberry chocolate truffle.  It has a slight acidity and sweetness from raspberry pairing perfectly with cocoa powder and chocolate ganache.

You will not get this type of crispiness if they were made more than four hours ago.  The price was quite reasonable at $6 a piece or $34 for half a dozen.  I would definitely come back next for a taste of their savoury eclair.\n\nThe decor is modern and calming with real tiny plants on each table, and I thought it was a nice touch to bring some energy into the cafe.

I give Nugateau  10/10  in  that category\n If i had to redo my purchase I  would have gone with the Monsieur Marnier and  Persian Pistachio  instead of the Brazilian Coconut  and Japanese Matcha .\nFlavours to Avoid:  Maple Bacon, Tahitian Vanilla ,Salted Caramel. I do not recommend trying these flavours because they are   classic and not unusual enough like their other flavors \n\nI highly recommend  that anyone try this place out, but only 'ONCE' because the quality of the product is fantastic and deserves it.

Like the casing, the  excess focus on presentation inflates the cost making    customers less likely to come for repeat purchases of 6 packs or one item purchases  . \nI will definitely return  for repeat visits with my friends once there is a fairer price.", 2], ["I loved the place, all the eclairs looked really pretty that you don't even want to eat them.

Made with precision and the taste was exceptional. I went with my sibling and we tried the pistachio, vanilla and mocha eclairs.  The flavors were perfect - not overbearing or too subtle.  The pistachio was my favorite!  A wonderfully decadent piece of art, dusted with gold. A definite must try! I also tried the Jasmine tea, imported from Paris.  It was wonderful.  \nAll in all, this charming eclair boutique (as I like to call it), is a lovely place.  There is great attention given to serving the best product with exceptional flavors.  Service was great as well - the owners exude passion and excitement!  I will certainly be visiting again.", 5], ["This new bakery is very good.

It seemed so colourful and unique since it specializes in eclairs. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in the quality and flavour.

They look amazing and are beautifully decorated, but I definitely don't recommend wasting your money with these.", 2], ["This place is adorable.  It is a tiny shop on Queen West and they specialize in eclairs.  The eclairs are beautiful and you can tell that a lot of love went into creating them.  They range from $4.50-$6.00.  They have some very cute seats in the front and back, but if you don't want to stay you can take away in the cute boxes.  \nFor our first visit we tried a dark chocolate eclair and a vanilla eclair.  They were both amazing, and did not last very long!\nI also ordered an iced latte, which was really good.  They should advertise that they have coffee on the outside, because I am sure people would drop in for a drink and then check out the eclairs.  I would definitely go back for coffee or eclairs or both :)  I will also consider taking them next time I go to a party.", 5], ["I'm so thankful for this little gem! I love eclairs and they have many different varieties here. I have not tried all of the ones I bought but sampled some of my purchase before leaving & it was worth it! I went back & purchased two more! I tried the milk chocolate eclair & that's exactly what's in the inside. I also tried an almond paste croissant. Very good! I bought pumpkin creme & another with berries on top, traditional. They also have tarts and apple crumb bake. They do have room in there to sit and munch & serve some sandwiches but really it's for dessert & coffee & it will be more comfortable in there when it gets cold. It was a little warm in there.", 5], ["I love the large selection of eclairs that they offer. I had the opportunity to try the salted caramel, toasted coconut and the Madagascar vanilla. The salted caramel, was my least favourite out of the three, since the caramel taste seemed to overpower the other flavours. The coconut and the vanilla were great. I think the downside of this place is that its so small, that there is no table or space for people to seat down and truly enjoy the product, especially if you would like to drink a beverage with it as well.", 4], ["Drip coffee is to die for!

The delightful Japanese girls asked me if I like honey  to sweeten to which I said only a little. She made it perfectly the way I like it! Needless to say...am I ever glad I chose this as it gives you a nice slight kick to the back of the throat (especially good for getting rid of the little tickle from a residual cold).

In any case, it wasn't sickly sweet the way most commercial cookies are made! \n\nThe girls were pleasant and smiling...the music happened to be my favorite jazz renditions like \"Girl from Ipanema\"...aged wood tables and mismatched chairs, benches and retro copper light fixtures...all made for a lovely, non-hurried atmosphere.

They had their own spice going and I didnt realize it until they asked me if I wanted to add honey to this.  Honey... in chai?  I should have said yes because the spice blend was not chai at all... rather it was very woody in flavour.

Usually on top of rice mixed with kale noodles (so good). \n\nI also make sure to never leave without grabbing a can of Kona Coffee. \n\nTIP: Parking is free across the street on Summerhill Ave.", 5], ["I've had a lot of poke bowls from all over the USA, but this place takes the cake. Deliciously handcrafted, fresh and heathly ingredients with a spicy twist!\n\nI'm vegetarian so I tried the spicy Hawaiian tofu which was delicious!!!\n\nThe space is also so cute and well decorated it felt like i was on the beach", 5], ["Umami Poke is a new poke place a few minutes away from Summerhill subway station on Yonge. I dropped by on a Tuesday at around lunch time and was pleasantly surprised by the food and staff! \n\nThe atmosphere of the store is nice! They have a neon sign that is definitely picture worthy and 5-6 tables if you would like to dine in. Scattered throughout, there are decorations that remind you of the beach or nature. \n\nAs you enter Umami Poke, you are greeted with smiles from the staff and decisions to make regarding your order. The concept of the eatery is a build your own poke bowl where you choose what kind of base you would like first (either salad, Japanese rice, or noodle). Next, you chose from the fresh poke selections to put on top of your base of choice. I had a hard time choosing which poke to select but decided to go for the Shoyu the 6ix (with salmon). I believe their daily poke offerings may change from time to time or they may have a special for the day. Either way, they are clearly listed as you decide. Once the poke is selected, you can choose from a variety of toppings including crab, seaweed salad, cucumbers, red onions, etc. Once that is complete you can add final toppings to your own  poke bowl. A small fish poke bowl will set you back $10, while regular poke bowl will cost you $13. \n\nFor my own poke bowl, I opted for the rice base and added my additional ingredients and toppings. The fish is definitely very fresh and the marinades they use on the fish are very flavourful! Probably has one of the tastiest compared to other poke places I've tried! \n\nStaff were very friendly and attentive making sure they got your order right. Since I dined in, the staff even came around to ask customers how they thought of their poke bowls.\n\nOverall, great addition to the neighbourhood and fresh and flavourful poke! The only downside is that the cost is a bit pricey.", 4], ["I loved my ginger tofu poke bowl!  Umami is a great addition to the area for a delicious lunch or quick dinner fix.  I loved that the concept is make it yourself because I always read the premade choices and always want to swap out items and make substitutions, etc.  There was tofu, tuna and salmon with different sauce pairings. She let me try the tofu varieties before making a decision (lucky she did because I almost chose the spicy flavour without noticing).  \n\nYou can have a base of either quinoa ($1 extra), zucchini noodles (\"zoodles\") or rice.  I had half zoodles half rice so that it would be filling but still a bit lighter.  You can pick unlimited veggies and toppings (except that avocado was $1 extra - totally worth it).  They also asked if you wanted extra sauce, which I did but it didn't feel too saucy/salty but I appreciated that they checked before drowning my bowl in sauce.  For tofu, the small size is $8 and the regular is $11.  I opted for the regular given the marginal price difference and it being my dinner.  However, the small size could be a filling lunch portion.  With the addition of avocado, my meal was about $13 with tax, which is great value for a delicious and relatively healthy dinner.", 5], ["Once you step foot into Umami you already feel so welcome and cozy. Loving what they did to the space. \n\nI got Salmon and tuna with zoodles,  edamame, enoki mushrooms, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, & crispy onions.\n\nEverything was so fresh I loved it! It tasted amazing would totally come back and try other combo \n\nThis is the first place that I know that offer quinoa as well for an extra dollar", 5], ["Although not a pet friendly store, they do have a water bowl outside for dogs to sip on. The adorable decoration through the window attracted many eyes as people walked pass by. Poke is a well known native Hawaiian dish (I learned it from Hawaii Five-O); Umami Poke's decor makes me want to get tickets to surf in Hawaii! \n\nThe service here is slow compared to other Poke joints I have visited, most of them located in downtown Toronto. The actual poke itself was delicious though, filled with goodies and lots of options that you don't see at the \"bigger named\" Poke places.\n\nThey open during weekends too!", 4], ["This is the place for a great tuna poke.  Choices are great.  I always get the spicy tuna one via foodora.", 5], ["Visiting from the US and this is the best poke I've had thus far and I've been to a lot of spots!\nTry the molten lava challenge if you love spicy food!", 5], ["Amazing little gem in midtown! I was never a huge fan of poke bowls, but since going here, I always want them. Very close to Summerhill subway station (parking available).\n\nThe store is very cute and the staff are very friendly. They have lots of customizations available, and a tofu option if you don't eat fish. I love that you can also swap out the rice for quinoa ($1) or \"zoodles\" (zucchini noodles) if you wanted. Portion sizes are pretty good, I am always full after eating here, and I normally have some leftover if I get a regular. My friend mentioned that the small has one scoop of fish, and the regular has two, and because she doesn't like a lot of fish, opts for the small. That might be something to consider when deciding on a size.\n\nEveryone I have brought here loves it, and always asks when we are going back! Also very Instagram friendly! They also have a stamp card and are on the Ritual App!", 5], ["My boyfriend and I came to this place after seeing their instagram molten lava challenge, and thought we'd have to give it a try. Upon arrive, we stepped into this cute poke shop with lots of cool decor and seating arrangements. Its surprisingly spacious and bright inside. Steve and jessica (the two servers/current owners) were super friendly, explained all the other different flavours they have and even let us taste test them. I loved the nutty Hawaiian and the spicy salmon. But the coolest thing is that they let you customize your bowl to your liking. They have rice, quinoa, and zucchini noodles as base, then you choose your fish, and theres just so many selections of additional toppings you can have mixed in. After trying them all we ordered 2 molten lava bowls and a spicy Hawaiian bowl. \n\nI usually love spicy food but oh man the molten lava was SPICYYYY. Its very similar to the korean spicy noodles. The first couple of bites were extremely delicious, but the heat quickly builds and youre left with tears streaming down your face. Nevertheless, i loved the flavours. Especially the spicy seaweed salad on top!! Yum!\n\nOverall i would def recommend this place. They offer delivery through ubereats and other companies as well. Super delicious and great prices will get me come back for more for sure!", 5], ["My son (11 yrs old) recommended this place and I was admittedly sceptical. However, as many have already posted, this place is a gem. The service is really friendly, the location is spacious and bright and the poke, most importantly, is awesome. The protein servings are generous and everything is fresh. Also, I should mention there is a wide variety of flavours and textures. If you are a poke fan, you can't go wrong if you are new to poke, this is a great introduction.", 5], ["Best poke place in town! I've tried a few other ones and Umami has the best tasting sauces. The fish was fresh and portions are very filling.", 5], ["This place is awesome! I got a small tofu bowl with Mighty Mayo on quinoa with most of their toppings (there was no limit) and it was delicious! I wasn't super hungry, so I really appreciated the option for a smaller portion. The tofu was silky and soft, the toppings were light and fresh, the food looked great, and the service was spectacular. Jessica and Steve gave us excellent suggestions for toppings and which of their amazing house-made sauces to pair with each of our bowls. The restaurant is also tastefully decorated and quite spacious -- overall a terrific experience!", 5], ["Great food. Great location. Amazing service. Its amazing. My favourite poke spot in Toronto.", 5], ["Came twice in the same week and the food is just amazing. Not only that, the staff was great and welcoming. Came in with my baby and even though they don't have high chairs, it's easy to sit and accommodate the stroller on the side. Will be back for sure.", 5], ["Very good poke, a lot better than most of the other poke spots in the city. Fish to rice ratio is really good and it's not drenched with sauce. I've gotten most of the variations and they're all really good (tofu, salmon, tuna). The zoodles bowl is surprisingly very filling and same with the quinoa bowl. If you've never had poke before, I'd suggest coming here to try it for the first time.", 5], ["Tasty Poke, Lots of Options, Good Value\n\nI didn't know there were so many options and toppings for a poke. It was fun to customize my bowl, based on the \"Always Lit\" -- a classic.\nI'm super-sensitive to the freshness of fish, but I was happy that the tuna tasted fresh. \nFriendly, helpful service in a bright, clean place mean that I'm looking forward to returning to try other flavours.", 5], ["Stopped by Umami Poke today, really enjoyed the vibe.

All bakery items are displayed in front close to cashier.  Rest of the place is seating in the back.\n\nLoukoumades/custard dessert were very good!  ~$5 for dozen / piece.\n\nHOWEVER, blonde cashier was pretty apathetic/bordering on rude.  Not very welcoming.", 3], ["This place is a total rip off,and the service is rude and nasty!\nSpend your money in Greektown at better places.\nOne last thing,look at the reviews that are 5 star and look at the photos,you think these are customers?  ......THINK AGAIN!\nRiP-OFF!", 2], ["I am in love with desserts in Greek Town.\nEver since my friend's work place moved to The Danforth, I started venturing around the area for cheap eats.  Early on, I discovered Athens, and I fell in love. \n\nI've tried quite a bit here. Usually, I get a dozen loukamades, a custard dessert, a spinach pie, and a custard pie.  \n\nFor the pies, the filling is abundant, enveloped by a thin, flaky crust. The contrast in textures and flavours between the sweet/savoury filling and the slightly sweet, buttery crust is what I think keeps it interesting.  I appreciate how the custard pie isn't overly sweet as well, provided that you opt out of the additional toppings  the staff offers upon serving you.  As for the spinach pie, it's mouthwatering, albeit a little heavy. It's probably the best spinach pie I've had in Toronto! This is my family's favourite and it is pretty fail-proof if you're looking for something to bring back home for others. \n\nAdditionally, the custard pie is on point if you've got a massive sweet tooth like me.  It's a moist custard cake doused in honey. You also have the option of adding cinnamon to it, which I recommend to add another dimension to the flavour palette.  Yes, it is very sweet, and as such, some people might not like it. I, on the other hand, adore this cake because of its moist texture and because of how the flavour of the custard still cuts through the heavy dose of honey.  \n\nLastly, the loukamades are a great resource for parties.  It's only a little over 3 bucks for a dozen, so buying in bulk while on a budget is very possible.  They look like donut holes/timbits marinated in honey. They are soft, sticky, and sweet. My mom really loves them, especially with cinnamon sprinkled on top. However, some people, like my bf, find it a bit too oily and sweet for their liking. Even I can't take more than two in a sitting before the oil and honey gets to me.  Nevertheless, I'm sure at least the majority of your party will like them. Just make sure you serve them with a glass of water, milk, tea, or coffee (avoid sweet drinks). \n\nThere's a lot to love here at Athens from the savoury desserts to the cheap price point to the mouthwatering spinach pie. I would say the only negative point would be that they only accept cash and debit.  Hopefully they'll add credit as a payment option one day. Then, I'd be visiting every day!", 4], ["BEST Loukoumades IN THE CITY!!\n\nDon't even bother going anywhere else. Friendly service and excellent quality!! I love their Loukoumades.

But if you have only one dessert... get here... get the Greek Honey Balls. I'm serious. It sounds obscene but the taste is more obscene than anything you can imagine. Yes, even you. Not me. But you.\n\nAt first I thought this was a place where they serve Paella, suckling dead baby pigs and Bulls. But that's actually Madrid Pastries. It's also not the place with the really snobby servers and high prices (Paris Pastries), or the place full of lunatics that think their island is a ship that can set sail for North America and finally be reunited with the rebels (London Pastries).\n\nWhat to get: Loukamades - Greek Honey Balls. Er.\nDid you say... Honey Balls...: Look just get them okay. Order them in Greek if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAnything else: Galaktoboureko (custard pie) and Spanakopita (Spinach Pie) are both really good. Those Greeks love their pies, don't they. And their honey balls. Well.\n\nLiterally one of the best desserts you will ever eat in your life. Loukamades.\n\nThese balls are seriously sticky and seriously perfect. I can't describe them. You have to come up to Toronto - right now - and try them.\n\nProbably the only sweet thing in Toronto that is better than the amaaaaazing Cr\u00e9me Brul\u00e9e donuts at nearby Von, these Honey Balls are some of the best Balls of any kind I've ever put in my mouth. And that includes all kinds.\n\nI mean, including Falafel Balls and Arancini Balls. What did you think I meant? Ew. Come on. Really? I would never.\n\n(Fingers Crossed Behind Back)\n\nThe long line for pastries is not always dealt with efficiently (it would be at Berlin Pastries), and sometimes I wonder if some of the servers are high on something (but then I remember, that only happens at Amsterdam Pastries). That one tall blonde girl that used to work here was pretty amazing (until she defected to work at Stockholm Pastries). And I like that they always open right on time, always close right on time, and execute all of their rivals (oh wait that's Moscow Pastries).\n\nI first tried them during the Danforth St Festival aka Taste Of Danforth. They were packed out the door and also selling them outside. They were soooooooo good, and so much better than anyone else who was offering them. Accept no substitute! You must get them from here! Get your Gyro at Messini and your balls here at Athens!\n\nYoung boys follow me outside this bakery on their mopeds and hit on me, much like at Rome Pastries. It could be worse, because their baked goods could taste completely neutral and bland, like at Bern Pastries (and its sister stores, Geneva Pastries and Zurich Pastries). And I appreciate that even when all the customers are drunk, the servers never are (unlike Dublin Pastries and Belfast Pastries). The honey balls are only wee little balls lassie but they're bloody good (so says the baker over at Edinburgh Pastries). Anyway I have a multiple-person date to go on now (with the girls from Prague Pastries, Budapest Pastries, Bucharest Pastries, Tirana Pastries and Sofia Pastries, if you must know).\n\nAnd if you feel (like those girls often do, which is how I met them) like showing it all off at the festival, New Orleans Style, then you can also pick up some Athens Pastys from Athens Pastries.\n\nTheir Spinach Pie here is also really good, but nothing compares to those balls of heaven. They put the \"ho\" in Honey. In a good way. Or is it put the Honey in Ho. Oh no that's something else. Never mind.\n\nDid you hear, by the way, that Istanbul Bakery is trying really hard to get into the Bakery Business?

The toast was very crunchy and the egg was really well cooked. I initially tried using a fork and knife to cut the toast, but it was too hard/crunchy. The chocolate banana muffin was very moist and delicious too. \n\nWhat I really loved about this place is the service. The employees are so friendly and warm, and very helpful with ordering or if you have any questions. \nWe were hesitant to get a stamp card at first, but we ended up starting a stamp card and also buying another black coffee for the road!", 5], ["Hi Jimson,\n\nOn the day I visited, there was no menu available and the employees offered us about 3 iced teas, in addition to an iced latte, iced coffee.

I saw that they won many awards and decided to give them a try. \n\nI'm not a coffee connoisseur and don't like my coffee black but I saw this interesting drink called coffee jelly latte (1/5) on the menu and I knew I had to try this. Where else can you get coffee jelly latte? Unfortunately, it was disappointing. What it essentially is ... is a coffee jelly shot topped with cream (or milk - it was thick so I'm assuming cream). I don't know about anyone else but I don't like drinking cream.... And since we're all environmentally friendly we use paper straws. This was difficult to suck the jelly out. Second, it's a normal sized straw not the bubble tea kind, ya know? I do not recommend getting this.\n\nGlad I was heading to our office and made a new drink from this, otherwise I wouldn't know what to do with this if I was travelling.\n\nChocolate beet muffin was not bad (3/5). I can taste some beets but overall it's a chocolate muffin with some healthy beets mixed in. I love beets so I don't mind.", 2], ["I am not a big fan of coffee, but I tried the coffee here and it was reaaallyyy good! Nice decor, friendly staff, amazing coffee.

Patio out back!", 5], ["A very cute little coffee shop, complete with a patio outside with blankets! I got the green eye latte, which was essentially a mint coffee latte.The drinks came out really fast and I like how they let you add the sugar by yourself so it doesn't come out super sweet.

I would however, be interested in trying their other drinks next time.", 4], ["BEST COFFEE DOWNTOWN. Such a brilliant blend full of chocolate-y notes.

The staff had friendly & chipper vibe.\n\nSun chai latte - extremely bitter & a strong tumeric-like flavor that overpowered the chai spices. A pass for me.\n\nJam cookie - The cookie had a pleasant chewy texture with slight crisp outer edges. However, the shortbread was severely lacking in flavor, whether coconut (not sure if this was vegan) or butter. Even the jam didn't taste of a specific fruit.", 2], ["If a cafe can do a cortado well, I'll keep coming back. And this place does a mean cortado. Lattes tend to be too milky for me, and their cortado was just milky enough to cut the acidity without being too much. They have non-coffee options as well and I'll have to go back to try those.\n\nThe place is cozy and the seating is pretty limited, but I like to go to the back where there's a bit more room, even if there are fewer seats. The baristas are friendly and the desserts are good. I recommend the walnut square!", 4], ["I decided to give this place a second chance (especially the desserts) and I'm glad I did. When I came this time, there were no flies to be seen and a case protecting the desserts. The desserts themselves tasted great- I just docked it off 1 star because I couldn't shake off the fly scene last time hovering over the sweets.\n\nLets get to the desserts themselves:\n\nJam Cookie- 5/5. They have a note saying this is a best seller and I can see why! It's got the jam in the center but the cookie itself has little seeds (chia/flax maybe?) that adds a little crunch and texture. \n\nFruit & Nut Cookie- 4/5. Also a delightful treat but it was a little more bread-y than I wanted for a cookie. Each bite had some nuts and seed so they definitely were not stingy on the ingredients.\n\nDate Square- 3.5/5. I'm a date square snob because these are my favorite desserts in the entire world and to be honest this place doesn't make the best ones. It's the dates themselves in these ones that weren't as gooey and sweet as I would've liked. I really wished I liked these.\n\nWalnut Butter Square- 4/5. I liked these! But not as much as the Jam cookies. They had a nice chewiness and the flavors weren't as sweet. I would get it again probably depending on my mood.\n\nBrownie- 2/5. I don't know what went wrong here but these tasted very bland and cardboard-like. I think I might've just gotten a bad one but wouldn't want to try this again.\n\nAll in all, the sweets here are good for a coffee shop.

I found HotBlack on Yelp and made my way towards it.\n\nThis is a charming coffee shop (that apparently has been featured a lot) where you can get a good caffeinated drink and/or some baked goods. I really didn't know what I wanted so the nice barista talked me through some drinks and I ended up going with the Russian Tea (Earl Grey tea infused with apricot jam).

They also have sandwiches, cold-pressed juices, and some other breakfast items. But I can attest that the coffee goes down so smooth and the muffins are freshly-made and super tasty! \n\nStaff are super friendly and down-to-earth. They always make the time to look you in the eye and give you a smile, which is appreciated (especially in Queen West). \n\nThe only challenge with this spot is that it's a bit small and crampy in terms of seating and a lot of high-tops, rather than comfy chairs to cozy up in.

Got a sun chai latte and a chocolate beef muffin. \n\nWhat I like about the muffin is that its super light and not sweet. You get a hint of sweetness from the occasional chocolate chips, but its not dense and caloric feeling like the typical bakery muffin.\n\nI am not a coffee person, but the latte was so good. Has a shot of espresso, you have that nice coffee aftertaste, and on top, it's so pretty! Comes in a cute double lined cup so its not hot to the touch and has a cool ombre colour too.\n\nThe staff are super friendly and are happy to explain or suggest items and even follow up with you to see if you liked it.\n\nDefinitely recommend!", 5], ["This place is nice and cozy.

There were also tons of wrapped up pastries and sweets (muffins, brownies, etc.) but not much in the way of a savory food menu. In fact, there is no food menu at all. There are simply a few pre-wrapped sandwiches to grab and go. \n\nAs for the \"best coffee ever,\" well, it was delicious. I got a 16 oz pour over that took about five minutes to make and wow. I drank it black and the flavor of it was thick and bitter and deep. I don't know how else to describe it. It really was good. \n\nThe staff was prompt and courteous, but they were also all business. No friendly small talk here. What's your order? Great, thank you. Go sit down, we'll bring it out. \n\nPrices were high. For my 16 oz pour over and one small hunk of a brownie it was $15 Canadian. \n\nSo they lost a star for price, as I think that's way outrageous.

Coffee is well needed. Didn't want to trick far for coffee haha but I did see HitBlack Coffee around the area. Coming in blind eye. I got a lovely ginger brew latte. I LOVE the taste of the ginger as it isn't too strong. It is balanced out with milk and sugar. Also, very soothing for the throat during this cold season. I also got an iced macchiato with milk, lovely,  not to dark but Miley strong in taste.\n\nAs for a morning snack... I got their jam cookie today. Unsure if it's freshly baked but when I bit into it, not stale. The crunchiness is awesome as it isn't too crunchy but more so chewy. The jam in the middle is a bit tad sweet for me. \n\nI also got the walnut butter square. You definitely taste the walnuts, and the butter. I found this snack more sweet than the jam cookie. Personally, not for me. I'll save it when I have those sugar cravings. This will definitely fulfill it with one bite. \n\nAs for the setting, very hip, comfy, welcoming, just comfortable space with decent amount of chairs and tables to enjoy your coffee and treat. \n\nThe customer service was great.

As a casual coffee drinker, I couldn't tell you how this coffee was any different than most other coffee shops in the area.

Coffee offerings are generally of the varieties that would allow one to enjoy the pureness of the coffee beans... no fancy coffee foam art or gimmicky add on or copy cat matcha this and that... I got an Americano and it was simply good.  \n\nAside from that the egg on a toast was again simple but yet satisfying in a very wholesome way. I was skeptical at first because the appearance of the toast was kind  of meh...but once I took a bite I knew that they really care about the selection of ingredients... three year old cheddar, local farm raised eggs and homemade sour dough bread. The bread had the necessary crunch at the bottom and the bread was very good. If the egg could be a bit runny would of made the toast perfect. \n\nThere was also a little red wagon near the entrance with a sign that says we will delivery and cater within wagon distance.

They have about seven tables, so you can still eat there. Despite the hot weather we decided to eat there since we wanted to have the food when they are freshly out from the oven. It was well worth the sweat!!!! We got #10 (cheese and veggies) and #16 (braised lamb and mozzarella).Including tax and tip, we paid $31 for two of us. \n\nThe crust was so thin you barely recognize it. STUFFED with goodness. Just absolutely delicious. You also get complimentary fresh parsley, slices of onions, pickled peppers and lemon wedges to balance out the heaviness and greasiness of pides. \n\nTwo women working there, they were very polite and friendly. They also have regular pizzas but seems like most people get pides here. Just trust me and try their pide!!!

After trying the food, it's probably the best option in the area and definitely better than anything you will get in Gerrard Square.\n\nI wasn't sure what to order so I decided to get the Karisik ($10.99) which is essentially an assorted pizza with each slice containing their best sellers. It contained grilled chicken, turkish sausage, ground beef and roasted lamb. The Turkish pizza was different from your traditional pizza but it was delicious nonetheless. It came piping hot out of the oven, the crust was done nicely, the mozzarella cheese was perfect and complemented the toppings really well.\n\nPizza Pide doesn't look like much from the outside but if you're looking for a delicious pizza that's very reasonably priced, then this a place you should definitely try out.", 4], ["This is a great neighbourhood joint.

I ordered the #6 because it uses fresh lamb instead of sausages or other dried meats.  The pide that came out in about 10 minutes (others are faster) was a large portion for one very hungry person...and I wanted to leave room for baklava (which was excellent).  I also tried some Turkish purple carrot juice (bitter, but not bad) and a yogurt drink (watery and salty yogurt = blech).  The decor is plain and about what you expect from a take-out pizza place.  This place is FAR from downtown by my standards so I won't come back often (or maybe ever), but I wouldn't hesitate to eat at this place again if I were around and craving some hearty, oily, lowish quality pizza-like food without cheese.

I ordered the chicken breast skewers which came with some chicken, rice and salad, all of which were decent. Nothing too special or of note, although I did find myself feeling like there was a lot of sides and not a lot of meat, especially considering the pretty penny that they charge for the entire platter.\n\nThis is a relatively safe option for a bite to eat in the area, although with all the other interesting options, personally for me, it would be tough to justify another visit.", 3], ["One of the better meals I had in Toronto. I sure paid for it because it was expensive! \n\nI got the grilled beef and it was good. The meat was a little undercooked on the inside but it worked because I was fine with it and I always like my beef well done. The rice was a little dry and a little cold. The beef was well seasoned but there really wasn't enough. See my picture. The BBQ sauce wasn't good and the meat could stand on its own without sauce. I don't know why they included this type of sauce for this type of food to be honest. \n\nThe portions made it not a good value so I don't know if I would return.

It's one of our favourite places for takeout. \n\nChicken shawarma with grilled vegetables - pretty good shawarma, chicken was moist and juicy, veggies were fresh and seasoned well.\n\nLamb burger kabob with grilled vegetables - the lamb was impeccably seasoned. You could really taste the lamb flavour. Absolutely delish.\n\nBabaganoush dip - highlight of the meal.

It 's a dine in only meal, which doesn't really make sense to me. They could easily pack it up. It came with two laffas, but you certainly need more for the amount of dip provided.  I chose the baba ganouj, fried eggplant, and labneh with zata'ar.

Well, now it's $20 as well.\n\nI suppose it is the cost of convenience, but the food gets cold and dry by the time it arrives, and the amount you get is pretty small as well.\n\nI'm more surprised that  when you order their box set, \"rice\" is considered a side.

Once the food arrived, we found a large plate with a generous helping of white rice, a leafy green salad, and 3 lamb pieces. The lamb was reddish in the center and very salty. The red sauce it came with diluted the salt a bit but just didn't quite achieve flavor success. The salad was pleasant and came with a colorless vinaigrette dressing that simply looked like a mucous explosion when applied. To brighten the experience we got an eggplant dip with chips.

Second thing, it DID taste delicious. The bread in the wrap is pretty divine - like a cross between pita and naan and for $12, that thing was pretty darn full - of chicken, hummus, pickled radishes, tomatoes, lettuce... it was all in there. I had it with the creamy garlic sauce and yum yum yum. No sides necessary. The wrap is so big that for better or worse, also no room for dessert.

They pack more veggies into the boxes at this site with comparable amounts of hummus compared to the Mount Sinai site. There's also an olive oil-free hummus option here for the same price, which I opted for today and would not recommend or do next time as the olive oil apparently adds so much more flavor and depth to the hummus. \n\nSpace is huge, service is very fast, format is order at the counter (no tip), and Wifi is free.

Once we'd made our way though the glass door next to the other glass doors through the last glass door, the layout was straightforward and pleasant.\n\nWe ordered boxes - mom had the beef with basmati rice and a salad.

Even after 20,000 steps through touristy Toronto, we had to tap out before finishing all the food.\n\nThe shawarma was flavorful and the portion significant. The potato wedges could have used a bit more dill - I wanted that tanginess to be stronger. The salad was good and the tahini sauce was also pleasant and creamy.\n\nMom's meal was the big winner here. The beef was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy and extremely flavorful. The basmati rice was also quite good, lush and rich. That beef, tho.\n\nThe bread served with the meal was also tasty and was obviously freshly made. Chewy, with great texture and enough flavor to be enjoyable without anything to go with it. But I'm a sucker for naan bread and anything like it.\n\nThe service was polite, but we didn't have much interaction as the meal is paid at the counter and they simply bring it out to you. My glasses were smudged and I have no idea what all these coins are worth so I put some on the table to tip. Hope that's not considered rude - and hope it was an ample amount.

Another bite into the falafel balls and there was another hair. We didn't bother asking for another exchange for it seems like the kitchen hand simply doesn't wear hairnets. I only finished my meal out of habit: I don't waste my food. \n\nTo add to the experience. The faucet in the men's washroom wasn't working. So no washing hands after your business.

I would recommend my friends to come here for the service and the sushi if they plan on doing the set.\n\nIn terms of service they are very polite and do not stop asking if everything is okay. Considering everyone is almost Japanese, it does feel like you're in Japan again.\n\nRegarding the food, the portion size is quite generous for nigiri. They also have a very wide selection fresh from Japan. I think the prices are a little high for what it is though. If you do come here, I recommend the premium nigiri set. I also highly recommend the grilled rice ball. Although it takes 20 minutes to make, it is one of the best rice balls I've tried. The outside is so crispy! And they add a soy sauce glaze. \n\nOne recommendation is to offer individual nigiri on the menu. I struggle to order here sometimes because I don't want two sushi pieces per order nor do I want two sashimi pieces per order. I'm almost forced to order the set to get individual nigiri...", 4], ["It's solid. My bf and I tried Nami for Winterlicious lunch and we found it to be good, but not necessarily worth the high price point. The fish was fresh, but the presentation was nothing special and you can definitely find similar quality sushi for cheaper elsewhere in the city. \n\nI was also surprised that they didn't ask if we wanted wasabi in our sushi, the answer of which would have been no. So we spent a bit of time digging the wasabi off the sushi rice. \n\nI wouldn't come back, but only because of the price.", 3], ["I came here for the summerlicious dinner menu and ordered the sushi for appetizer and the sashimi for entree.

If the miso soup tastes authentic and on-point, the food to come will usually be authentic and tasty. Such was the case for Nami. The starting miso soup was not diluted like most Japanese restaurants in North America, but rich and just right. The sushi and sashimi served was fresh, and though it didn't seem like a lot of food. It left me surprisingly full. I ended my meal with the matcha ice cream, it was rich and creamy but not too sweet. A perfect meal.\n\nThough the dining experience here was great, and I was satisfied with the food, I can't say I would come here too often. The prices are definitely a deterrent to coming back to this restaurant.", 4], ["Great tasting sushi and sashimi, friendly stuff and thr service is great.

I came here with 6 of my coworkers for lunch and we were happy to have been seated in the traditional style tatami seating which made us feel very exclusive. I ordered the shrimp/vegetable tempura, 5-piece sushi and 3-piece spicy tuna sushi set and the matcha ice cream with azuki. The shrimp/vegetable tempura was good, what you would expect from any sushi place. The 8-piece sushi had poor presentation and I was disappointed to see that had put a thin layer of wasabi underneath the meat of the sushi. I don't do well with spiciness and my throat was burning from the amount of wasabi they had inconsistently put in the red tuna sushi piece. Besides that though, the fish was fresh and had that melt-in-your-mouth taste that you crave for in sushi. Finally, the maccha ice cream was the saviour for me. It was a nice finish to a some-what disappointing lunch.\n\nMost of my coworkers found their lunch so-so. One of my coworkers got the Salmon Ikura Don which looked delicious with the salmon roe but he said it tasted plain and was not plentiful. Two of my coworkers got the salmon teriyaki which they really enjoyed but similarly found the portion far too tiny. And finally, two of my other coworkers got the Gindara Saikyoyaki (black cod) dish as their main and found the food delicious but too small. For $28 (+tip/tax) for a not-so-filling lunch I would say skip this place for Winterlicious. The portions are too small and not that satisfying! The restaurant ambience though is lovely and I would likely want to give this place another try, just not during Winter/Summerlicious.", 3], ["Got the chance to sit in their Tatami room which was a great experience, they were having Summerlicious menu too, so I tried Katsuo Tataki as starter which was okay, sashimi as main course, again it was good fresh taste and nicely decorated and the dessert was ice cream or orange, so I tried black bean ice cream which was too good. From the starting I knew I won't be full with this menu choice, so I ordered sushi pizza which could have been amazing if the rice base was not that cooked but still enjoyed every bit of it.

We got the tuna tartare, seafood salad, chirashi sushi and unagi don between the two of us and every one of them were delicious.

As you wouldnt need any soy sauce with each bite, every nigiri made by the chef serves its own purpose. I also appreciate them telling you which to eat and in which order so the flavours dont get muddled/overpowered from a bite you previous had from another nigiri.\n\nThat being said, be prepared to pay lots for the quality and you possibly wont be full. Came with a party of 4 and definitely left feeling hungry, but we did include the steak which was simply divine and highly recommend! So tender, juicy, perfectly cooked to medium rare. Steak was sliced but still soft to touch and blood did not drip all over the plate. Perfectly seasoned and well balanced. \n\nDessert could not be faulted as well. Great matcha flavours pairing well with the textures on all aspects of the plate. \n\nWill come back for special occasions for sure.", 5], ["I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place.

The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.\n\nWe ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..\n\nService was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times.

The level of finess and creativity/artistry that goes into Miku's fusion sushi is amazing and honestly better than sushi in Japan. My favourite from Miku is their assorted sushi platter. There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense. \n\nEver since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi. The sashimi is also very high quality, tastes fresh and creamy. \n\nAnother hidden gem is their Momo sake (peach wine). I normally hate the taste of alcoholic drinks but I want to buy 10 bottles of this!! It's very very peachy and so delicious if you like sweet fruits and wines. \n\nMy recommended menu is $38 sushi platter and peach wine if you want to try Miku without killing your wallet!!", 5], ["Really delish sushi but OMG it's expensive.\n\nI love sushi and I always try to find a great deal (not bang for your buck!).\n\nThe place truly is stunning and the service is excellent and the sushi is REALLY good but I wouldn't go back because the prices are very steep.\nI guess you are paying for the real estate (situated in a beautiful waterfront location).\n\nYou can easily walk down the street and find quality sushi thats a fraction of the price. \n\nI highly recommend going here with a group of friends as this allows you to try and sample lots of different types of sushi, sashimi and other dishes that might seem interesting on the menu.\n\nI had the 'Miki Signature Selection' which is what they are known for (Aburi Oshi).", 4], ["Miku is an excellent fine dining experience. Everything is immaculate from the food to the service. Plates are cleared promptly, utensils are changed and glasses are always full. \n1) The aburi oshi sushi is a must - i love the salmon.

It'll change your perspective on sushi.\n2) And the true showstopper is their DESSERTS! I love the valrhona chocolate cake and the matcha opera cake. Whoever their pastry chef is, is a genius. Everything has the right balance in that it's never too sweet and the flavors are so complex. \n\nOnly one star off because the prices are steep, compared to new spots in the city that are popping up serving torched pressed sushi at better prices. I've been to the sister restaurant in Vancouver and quality is very similar. Great for an occasion like an anniversary.", 4], ["Went back again today, it's still amazing. We had a couple of different dishes this time.\n\nWe started with the Coal Harbour Platter - its a mix of mussels, oysters, an Oyster shooter, poke, ceviche, and scallops. It was great! Everything was so fresh and was prepared to allow for maximum flavor.\n\nNext we had the Miku Roll. This is the first time we've had this roll in its entirety as one ingredient in the roll was sold out the last few times. I thought the roll was amazing before, but having it with every intended ingredient makes it perfect.\n\nNext we had the salmon and ebi aburi sushi. It's pressed, torched, and seasoned perfectly. The one thing that stands out about this roll is the rice. The smokiness of the torch is passed on to the rice, which is rare. It adds a flavor depth that is hard to match.\n\nEverything was perfect again, another great experience.\n\n5/4", 5], ["Great restaurant. Perfect venue for a celebration. The aburi sushi is amazing.

The restaurant has a great modern vibe. And the service is excellent.\n\nWe've been several times, and the food has been consistent. Their Kaiseki menu is a go to. On our recent visit, we got the Kaiseki with a side of oysters. Their oysters are tasty and juicy. Their sashimi platter is fresh, but just okay. Besides that to start, there was lobster tail and oysters, tuna tartare, and seared scallop with bacon bits. Each was plated in Arita plateware. Each was also unique in taste, but worth the price. The main is a beef tenderloin that is super tender and scrumptious. For additional fee, the steak is paired with heavenly foie gras that just melts in your mouth with umami. And after that, there is a selection of pressed and torched sushi, and Miku is known for their torched sushi which is flavourful and delectable. Besides the taste, the presentation is quite remarkable. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend coming here with your significant other on important occasions to try their tasting menu. It'd definitely make a memorable meal.", 5], ["I have tried this place twice and did not like the raw fish provided here.

I also appreciated the fact that the servers explained the dish to us every time they brought out a new one. There is so much attention to detail, that even the house made soy sauces have descriptions provided with them.\n\nWe had one person in our party who had a gluten allergy and the staff made sure that we were well taken care of.\n\nLastly I tried the Green Tea Opera dessert, which looked like a masterpiece! They told us it actually takes 72hrs to make the actual cake because of how much care and effort is needed for each component of the dish. \n\nThis restaurant is a little on the pricy side, but the great service and delicious food are definitely the reason why.", 4], ["The service here is just amazing. I had the 5 course chef special. I can't say I was amazed by the appetizer or sushi, but the black cod was delicious, and the green tea cake at the end was tantalizing my tastebuds all night! The first course was a small mix of sashimi, the second course was pretty impressive, it was a scallop, lobster tail with oyster, tuna tartar, and some sesame crisps, this course was also very enjoyable. The third course was the black cod, it was very rich and tasted so fresh! The sushi was the 4th course and should be taken off the menu. I was really disappointed with the taste of the sushi and the quality of the sushi rice. The fifth and final course was the matcha 7 layer cake topped with seasonal fruit sitting on a bed of matcha butter cream.", 4], ["I have always wanted to try this place out. It did not disappoint. My fiance and I had the holiday kaiseki and it was fantastic to say the least. The price point is obviously high, but you do get what you pay for.

I love the Miku roll, the seared fish eggs around the sides of the roll make it so nice and creamy to bite into. The Ebi Oshi has to be one of my favourites. The lime is just perfect. It's also very creamy. It looks like theres a LOT of rice but they marinated the rice so well it doesn't feel like its a lot when bitten into. Presentation is also on point. The only thing i would say is the food can sometimes come out different temperatures every time. I do like it cold usually. \n\nService & Cost: The service is always great. Never had bad service every time i have gone. They have coat service at the front for winter and the waiters (even the ones that aren't looking after your table) sometimes just stop by to chat. The cost is not cheap. It's pretty pricey. The rolls average around $20 for only a few pieces. The sashimi can get extremely pricey. Their prime platter only has 9 pieces for a whopping $60.

My boyfriend and I both had Sakura Kaiseki sets, and everything was beautiful, with interesting ingredients that complimented every dish.

They have super fresh fish, lots of fun cooked seafood dishes, AMAZINg desserts, but they steal my heart with their aburi (flame-seared) sushi.  I've tried a lot of aburi in Toronto, and Miku ALWAYS wins the contest.  The flavour is strong but delicate.  The rice is always the perfect texture.  Even though some other restaurants have more types of aburi, Miku does Salmon, Ebi and Saba the best.\n\nWhat I love about Miku is that it puts so much thought into every little touch and flavour. In the Flame-seared sashimi platter, each piece of sashimi is delicately topped with various sauces and garnishes so that each bite is an explosion of flavour and texture. And of course, the fish is super fresh and top quality. \n\nThe desserts here are UNREAL.  The Green Tea Opera is to-die-for - it has layers of matcha and hazelnut, with tons of different textures (smooth mousse like textures, crispy wafer textures, and more).

The waiters and waitresses who brought us our food provided great customer service.\n\nAs for the food, I got the Miku zen to start off, which had a variety of food - my favourite was the shrimp.

The food quality, the atmosphere and the service have always been outstanding. However, it changed after one night.\n\nWe made a dinner reservation on Valentine's Day this year. As always, we were expecting to have a great dinner and a good experience. But the next thing you know, I have found myself a piece of hair in my mouth... (ughh, it still grossed me out thinking about it.) Quickly, we called our server and she apologized and took away the dish (Fried Calamari)right away. \n\nWhen her returned, she informed that they would make us a new dish. (Okay?!) A few minutes later, the Manager came over with the new dish and below was the conversation:\n\nManager: We apologize for your experience, but here is a new dish. \nMe: This is very disappointing, as I didn't expect to find a piece of hair in my food. My experience has been ruined. \nManager: Well, this does happens. We are very sorry for it.\nMe: Oh, so it happens on a regular basis?!\nManager: No, but it does happens and we try to avoid it obviously. \n\nI was blown away by his comments... THIS DOES HAPPENS?! Wow...so, you are telling me that finding hair in my food is a normal thing then? Such a scary statement, especially coming from a high end restaurant.\n\nEven though they discounted a roll from our bill, but it did not make everything okay, plus they didn't tell us about it. \n\nThe whole dinner was unpleasant, and I would never come back again. Not after that statement...IT DOES HAPPENS! Guess I was just unlucky then, my bad...LOL\n\nUnbelievable...and hilarious.", 1], ["I have tried nearly everything on their menu and my favourite would be the miku roll and the raspberry point oysters.\n\nFor their aburi oshi, I enjoy the salmon and the ebi (prawn), however I don't think the saba (mackerel) is anywhere near the other oshis' standard.  Another dish that I would not recommend is the garden roll. \n\nAll the fried appetizers i've ordered have been subpar, including the calamari, so I would definitely recommend their salad instead as a more delicious option. The salads often come with interesting citrus dressings that are always enjoyable.\n\nAdditionally, if you are considering ordering kaisen (from the sea), the oysters are phenomenal. To be honest, there isn't a reason to order the platters as they simply lack in quantity of oysters and give other elements which are not nearly as delicious. Stick with the raspberry point oysters! Those are the best oysters they serve.\n\nFor drinks, my S.O. is in love with the espresso martini so I would suggest that to anyone who is interested.\n\nThe decor is beautiful, sleek, bright, and modern. With its high ceilings it is truly a beautiful restaurant perfect for any special event or just for a meaningful meal. I've never needed to make reservations as the restaurant has a big capacity.\n\nIn my opinion, the only roll worth ordering is the miku roll which will blow you away!", 5], ["I wanted to try out this place after I saw it on Yelp and I must say, the reviews for this place are indeed warranted!\nI went with a friend for my birthday celebrations and we ordered miso soup, 2 rolls of Salmon Oshi Sushi,\nEbi Oshi Sushi and the Green Tea Opera Cake for dessert. The sushi is amazing and melts in your mouth and the miso soup is also a must have!  \n\nSalmon Oshi sushi has a slight lemon kick to it while Ebi Oshi Sushi has a smoked salmon taste with a kick of jalepeno to finish it off! The sushi comes marinated so there is NO NEED of soya sauce or any other sauces (spicy mayo etc.)\n\nThe staff deserves a solid 5/5\nThey are quite knowledgable about the  menu and do a great job at explaining the options. They are also  super attentive while cognizant of your space so they don't crowd around your table, but as soon as you need someone, they magically appear!

The beef was my favourite since it had just the right amount of fat in each bite to melt in your mouth. The fried ebi was juicy and the tuna sashimi was surprisingly great (since I normally don't like tuna)!The salad was super refreshing and I loved the textures, especially the feta-like tofu. All the sauces were savoury and complemented both the light and heavier dishes.\n\n//MAIN// \nThe Aburi Platter (3/5)- 6 pieces, the 2 aburi pieces were still flavourful but just not torched hot so it wasn't as melt in your mouth ): otherwise the other sushi were pretty standard and tasty.\n\n//DESSERT//\nBanana Panna Cotta (3.5/5)\nGreen Tea Opera Cake (3/5)\nThe opera cake just tasted like a Ferraro rocher since the chocolate overpowered the supposed red bean layer and green tea buttercream.

The fish was fresh and the spicy mayo was actually spicy! \n\nWe had the lettuce wraps, which were divine. We had to wrap the pork belly ourselves, which was nice. The sauces complimented the pork belly. And the pickled veggie really cuts through the richness! \n\nThe karaage was super filling and flavourful. No dry chicken here! \n\nThe slider baos were delicious but super heavy. Be prepared for that! \n\nThe only dish that wasn't great was the halibut tacos. Absolutely lacking in flavour, but plenty of garnish ok top. The fish was delicious itself but very plain and bland. 1/10.", 4], ["Not a bad restaurant but had a different (unexpected) atmosphere.  The food is decent for the price and service was quiet good.  First, the atmosphere/vibe was different because it was more a bar than restaurant.  The front half of the place which was semi full was the bar with most people casually having a drink.  The back half of the restaurant was curtained off because it was empty of people (could have seated ~50).  We were there for dinner at 8pm on Friday.   I don't believe there was another table ordering dinner or much food. So vibe different because it is essentially a bar not restaurant.  Unless other evenings people eat there.\n\nSecond, the food: we ordered a variety of items off the menu to share (lobster Mac and cheese, fries, fried chicken, tuna sashimi, both rolls on the menu, shrimp tempura).  Overall, the food was good and decent portions for the price - the rolls were giant. The booze also was decently priced - had a flight of sakes (3 -1oz shots) for $10.  \n\nService was very good.  The servers were attentive and not pushy.  The empty feeling of the restaurant is the main reason for 3 stars.  Food is 3.5.  Service is 4.  A smaller sized place would likely be better for experience.  Suggest Hapa for drinks and maybe some food to nibble on.", 3], ["The food itself is quite good. The portions are hit or miss. My favourite was their parmesean fries. The fish tacos were expensive but tasted pretty good.\n\nThe male server kept reaching over us unnecessarily. Their bathroom smelled like fresh cigarettes.

Quite a good izakaya, they seem to like to light everything on fire here. Good use of blow torch. I took my parents here and they were impressed.

We were pleasantly surprised! Every dish we ordered was unique and the 6ix roll was mouth watering. So was the wagyu! Service was nothing amazing but nothing terrible. They were understanding that we are a group of four that ordered very little. Also, the place was busy but not incredibly busy for a Saturday night. Atmosphere was very trendy and cool with the open kitchen. Overall good for an izakaya, but may need something to set it apart from others. Not sure what it is though.", 4], ["Always wanted to try this place, so went with a friend for summerlicious. we went at 5:30 so the place was pretty empty, which was expected. We both ordered the aburi salmon donburi and chawanmushi. The meal came with a few side dishes which included a fried fish cake that was filled with uncooked flour. The chawanmushi was pre made and very choppy, not smooth at all. The aburi salmon donburi was pan seared, overcooked and very very dry. We went by the entire night didn't really complaint about every little thing. But I did pointed out to our waiter that the fried fish cake has uncooked flour sitting in the middle when he came to take our plate. He looked shocked, did not comment and said he will show the chef. It's an open kitchen so I could see that they all gathered around and took a look at the uncooked floury fish cake. Not for once did our waiter come back and apologize. He only came back and asked if we want dessert. He pretended like nothing happened. The only reason I gave 2 star for the service was only for the hostess from the bar.

The quality of the food is great and I understand that this is an izakaya but for the amount that you're paying it did not feel worth it.

One suggestion for the restaurant manager though, please pace the delivery of the food. At one point we had 5 dishes on the table. The beauty of Omasake is to enjoy course by course with great company and conversation. We were trying to chat and enjoy a great time but the server shows up with food every 3 mins.

We were a rather large group and they accommodated us pretty well.

Guu, Nome and other izakaya's seem to have a much larger assortment and variety on the menu for much lower prices. Also the food was decent at best. Nothing to rave about when you spend $10 on 2 taco's.\n\nTheir drink menu was extensive and had a lot of choices. THey had 4 for $20 cocktail special and the Mr Miyagi drink went down pretty easily. There was a sherbert tasting cocktail called Miss Kitty. $12 is a bit much, but it tasted ok. Sapporo Towers are the best value they have and we ordered quite a few of those.\n\nIs this a place I would go to just dine- probably not! With a large group. Was a lot of fun", 3], ["Came here after looking at the reviews and pictures online. The restaurant is pretty big, they had both indoor and outdoor seating available. The decor and ambience was pretty nice. \nThey had an open kitchen concept where you can see the chefs prepare the food. \n\nIt was a Saturday night at around 6pm, the restaurant was empty, we were the only ones here. They had about 3-4 kitchen staff, and two waitresses but the service was really slow. The waitresses were just chilling around and talking to each other.

We were really excited to try it but it was not good. The sushi was really bland and the lobster is pretty tasteless. There was very little sauce. I would not consider this oshizushi, more like lobster niguri. It was pretty much just plain rice in the shape of a rectangle, topped with lobster. Similar to the lobster, the shrimp oshizushi wasn't good. It didn't have the special flavourful taste that most oshizushi have. Hapa's Oshizushi is not anywhere comparable to JaBistro or Miku. \n\nFire cracker pressed sushi (Oshizushi), it was seared in front of us. Wasn't that good, still very bland if you eat it without soy sauce. We did not finish it. \n\nWagyu Pressed Sushi (Oshizushi) , it was simliar to the rest of the food. Very Bland. Most places top this type of sushi with a sauce but there was non in this case. Must be eaten with soy sauce. It was cool how they torch it in front of you though.\n\nHowever, their portions are bigger than Miku and JaBistro. The order came with 10 pieces whereas, the other places come with 6. \n\nOverall, i did not like the place.

The pork belly number was pretty good. \n\nI ordered a drink but it wasn't to my liking, so thankfully the male server I had took it off, but wouldn't really recommend this place tbh. There's way more better places in the area and surrounding", 3], ["The place is nice and bathrooms are clean but the food wasn't great.

However, the sashimi salad was average while the the sushi bites were  lacking.  I realize that this is a fusion restaurant but the sushi rice was not good and the 4 different types (dynamite, B.C Salmon, fish & chips and bacon & scallop) were small and nothing special at all.  I didn't try the meat dishes as my friend only eats seafood and veggies.\n\nOverall, the restaurant has the atmosphere and the entire restaurant was filled for the most part.

A major perk at Hapa is that they do separate bills - no matter how large your group is. I've been to a birthday party of 20 and 30, both times settling the separate bills was super easy. \n\nTheir food is really good, however you don't get much for the price you pay.

I'm a udon noodle fanatic so I'm super picky, but the udon here is sooo creamy and chewy. Perfect amount of meat too!

I was disappointed in the Hello Kitty drink as it tasted like medicine.\n\nWe shared the pork belly lettuce wraps ($11), wings ($9), and the sushi bites ($16). The food came out very quickly. The wings were small and were just fried. The sauce that came with the wings made it taste more delicious. For $9 for small wings wasn't worth it. I could get a pound of wings for a larger size for the same approximate price. The pork belly lettuce wraps were decent. The sushi bites didn't actually taste like dynamite as it was described on their menu.

Edamame - I really liked this simple dish, and could have eaten a lot more of it. Very tasty. Recommend.\n2. Tuna Avocado Salsa Dip - This was one of my favourite dishes. It was very light and refreshing, with great flavours. Came with great plantain chips. I wanted more! Recommend.\n3. Beef Tataki - This also went down very easily, smoothly and quickly. The sesame-chili sauce was also sweet. Recommend.\n4. Tuna Carpaccio - It was pretty smooth as well, but wasn't a stand-out dish for me.\n5. Negitoro - The tuna belly was rich, but the garlic bread pairing was a bit off. Too much bread, would have liked this on something a bit thinner and drier.\n6. Ebi Mayo - Another stand-out dish! (How many favourites can I have in one meal?? You will notice the dishes getting progressively heavier here. This is also when I started to slow down as my appetite could not keep up). Recommend.\n7. Renkon Gyoza Tempura - Instead of regular dumpling wrappings, these were enrobed in thin lotus root and deep-fried. It was so-so for me.\n8. Halibut Taco - This one had a surprising kick with the jalapeno tartar sauce. My SO liked this one very much, but I was less enthused. I was saving room for something that would wow me more. Luckily...\n9. Beef Short Ribs - These were delicious and finger-licking good. Very thin, easy to eat, and had a nice smoky soy marinade. Beef quality was nice too, not too fatty nor too dry. Sooo good. Recommend.\n10. Karaage - Least favourite dish of the night, it was a bit dry and not too flavourful. Pass!\n11. Spicy Pork Ishi-Yaki - It had nice flavour, but I would consider this more of a \"filler\" dish (as in get this one to fill you, instead of two non-rice/noodle dishes).\n12.

The plantain chips were tasty.  \nRenkon Gyoza Tempura - Jut a regular gyoza to me.  At least they were a little bigger than expected and were nicely stuffed so it wasn't just all just wrapping.  The dipping sauce was nothing special just tasted like soy sauce to me.  \nSpicy pork Ishi-Yaki (minced pork with rice in a hot stone bowl) - It was OK but was missing something.\nMatcha fudge - This is the same stuff I get from out of a box from the Asian grocery store\nPanna cotta - This was a nice dessert, I'm a sucker for panna cotta.

The website suggests beautiful, design centric, or at least thoughtful interiors to all the locations, but Harbord is talked about as the quintessence, the epicentre of Sam James Coffee Bar. The interior just feels incomplete and sad. There are perhaps three stools and a bench outside, which, given this is Toronto, sees a limited use. I obviously didn't expect wi-fi, but I might have stayed a bit longer if the foodstuffs on offer looked a bit more appealing. Drip coffee is not the speciality here--they didn't do pour-overs or anything like that. If you want to see baristas flex their muscles and show off their skills, try an espresso drink.\n\nAs mentioned, they only take cash, though admirably, every location has the same attitude when you look inside your empty wallet--'no problem, come in and pay later'.

Interesting thing is that even though cappuccino is labeled as old style it is served the modern way (wet cappuccino) with latte art and all.\nThe latte art was decent on the drink with crema nicely spread under the nicely frothed milk so good marks for presentation here.

You don't necessarily need to pick one of the pre-determined sundae combinations.

It was quite a long wait but we did come during the prime hour (it was the middle of the afternoon and it was a scorching hot day!). \n\nWhen we finally got to the menu, I was a bit confused how to read it. I can tell that Arctic Bites was trying to go for a unique, hipster feel, so the menu was chalked in on a blackboard down below.\n\nFor me personally, I do feel like they should put the menu on a more visible area so that customers can choose what they want while they wait. After all, my mom and I couldn't even look at the selection until we got close to the cashier. In addition I feel that there should be some description about what the selections are. During my visit there I saw a lot of people inquiring about what selections are and what they have on it, especially for the Thai Me Up selection. I feel that if they displayed the menu more clearly and have little descriptions the place would be a lot more easier to visit!\n\nRegardless, my mom and I ordered with ease once we finally got to the cashier, and got to watch the young ladies make the ice cream. I almost felt bad for the girls that worked there - making the ice cream required some extreme labor in my opinion. In addition it also takes some time to make, which is what I believe caused the line up. \n\nAfter about another 10 minutes in addition to the wait in the line up, we got our beautiful orders. My mom ordered the Taro with a Twist Ice cream, while I got the Your Morning Cup selection (I am a huge coffee lover). \n\nThe ice cream alone was actually very fulfilling. You can tell that it was sweet, fresh and very creamy - all very favourable things to have in ice cream. In addition, the display was definitely photo worthy! Was it worth the wait though?

I bust his balls every time he comes back and wants to try something new now.\n\nIt's not like this place was horrible, but it wasn't anything spectacular either. In hindsight, it was my fault for agreeing to stand in line. For 3 hours. For ice cream. I feel bad for the workers as they were wearing wrist supports. The hype must have given them carpal tunnel and they were sweating a fair amount. The line did not look that long now that I'm thinking back but I guess even 30 people would be quite a bit of a delay since making each order would take 5-8 minutes. \n\nWould I go here ahead? Well, maybe if there wasn't a line. And Kekou was closed. And there were no ice cream trucks nearby.", 2], ["This should be called ice rolls instead of ice cream. I have to say that the \"ice cream\" looks pretty cool and they have nice method to make it but regarding flavour and texture is not good at all. My ice cream was not creamy at all with coffee flavour that tasted as ice cubes with coffee flavour. Not worth the $8.", 2], ["Ordered the Mr. Grey ice cream rolls, got to see them make it. The rolls are quite pricey ($7) and there's 5 different combinations or signatures you can pick from. I noticed that the rolls were very quick to solidify but traditionally, Thai ice cream take much longer to work with to change its state and hence make it a creamer texture. With this, I felt like it wasn't as creamy as I expected but I'm glad I got to try it out.", 3], ["Arctic Bites is an ice cream parlour! And what sets it apart from the multitude of other ice cream locations in Toronto? Well, it features Thai rolled ice cream that they create right in front of your eyes. \n\nThe lineup varies from day to day- I've seen the crowd of people stretch all the way down the street before. Luckily the day I managed to get in, there weren't many customers milling about. \n\nFor the menu it's supposed to change every day, but what we ordered was the Mr. Grey, with earl grey ice cream, whipped cream, and half of a cookie. You can also customize it with additional toppings, and they roll up quite a lot of ice cream in your bowl. \n\nThe taste of the ice cream itself is... mediocre. I've had better ice cream in Toronto. It doesn't taste bad, however, and I'm willing to come back just to see them roll it up again!", 4], ["The aesthetic of the store is very simple and cute but that's all it's got going for them. When I entered, staff members were on their phones while customers were around trying to order. I for one, find that pretty unprofessional. They dont have many options on the menu as well. I also found the price of the actual product to not be worth for what you are getting. I ordered the \"Thai To Go\" and not only did I not find the price to be worth it, the lack of thai tea flavour made my experience that much more disappointing. In the end, it was not worth the money spent and I will definitely not be coming back.", 2], ["I came here a couple weeks after their first grand opening and as expected, there was a long line. It was definitely worth the wait. The way they make or shall I say roll the ice cream is such a cool concept. You get to watch the staff make your order right in front of you which makes a great experience. The flavors they offer are are definitely not your average ice cream flavors you can get at a grocery store. Parking is not that difficult to find as there is one a few steps away from the entrance. The staff was friendly and helpful with the decision making. Can't wait to come back and try out more flavors!", 5], ["It's cute, but pricey. The staff were nice. The concept is cool and it's fun to watch them make it.  They have a good array of flavours and the ice cream is not terribly sweet.", 4], ["Went to downtown Toronto over the summer and this dessert place was the highlight of the trip. Great rolled ice cream that's very filling did to the toppings, and the price is fair. I ordered the mango strawberry with extra fruit sand loved it. You can also see your dessert being made right in front of your which adds to the experience. Definitely recommend this place.", 5], ["I saw a video on my Facebook of this rolled up ice cream from Thailand and I thought it was quite neat and wish they'd have something like that in Toronto. And what do you know... here it is!\n\nI ordered Mr. Grey and it was not as aromatic as a cup of Earl Grey tea. The flavour was veryyyy light. The ice cream however, was not too sweet which I enjoyed. It would be better if the flavour was stronger. All in all, I wasn't very impressed with Mr. Grey... I tried my friend's milk tea ice cream and I liked it a lot more. It was pretty much milk tea in ice cream form. It only comes with 1 size and the portion is quite plentiful. They only have a few items on their menu - short and concise but, they do give you the option for additional toppings. \n\nThe concept is what gets the crowd: pouring a mixture onto a cold platform, doing some karate on it until it solidifies and finally rolling it up.  It's definitely an experience thing (i.e. trying a new way of eating ice cream) however, for flavour wise, you're better off somewhere else.", 3], ["A lot of hype and a little disappointing. While the rolls are cute, it's pretty expensive for essentially made-on-the-spot frozen cream, milk, sugar, and flavor.\n\nThe line is ridiculous. About a 30 minute wait total at 2pm on a Wednesday. There is plenty of room in the store, but instead they limit it to like 5-8 people in the store and have everyone else wait outside. Normally, this isn't a huge deal, but it was really, really hot outside. Can't they just let more people in the store and queue it up along the wall so that people can get some AC? Plus there's no place to sit and eat, so you have to take it back out into the heat and eat it quickly before it melts.\n\nPart of the reason why it's so freaking slow is because there are only 3 iced table tops to make the rolls. One machine is down, because they have to do hourly maintenance defrosting, so you're left with 2 machine and each order taking 3+ minutes.\n\nAt least you can admire the labor that goes into making this dessert. The fruity flavors like strawberry (Love at First Bite) and mango (Takes Two to Mango) require more work because they chop up the fruit and mix it into the base. The non-fruit flavors like black Sesame (Miss Black) or Earl grey (Mr. Grey) have less of a show, since it's just pouring the base down, waiting until it hardens, and then pushing them into rolls.\n\nThere's no customization. All the cups are pre-set with the flavors and toppings for $6.50. We had Miss Black with a black sesame base, grass jelly, and condensed milk. While it was unique, the ice cream itself is much harder/less creamy than normal ice cream, since you're not whipping air into it. If you have ever made ice cream yourself with the Cuisinart maker, this is almost identical to the harder bits that you scrape off of the bowl at the end. Still good, but not as exciting as you'd expect.\n\nOnly cash or credit.", 3], ["came here for dessert after having ramen since i've been wanting to try this place for a while now. love that the inside has white marble detailing and their logo is a baby penguin - bonus point for them because i LOVE penguins! \n\ni also love how you're able to watch them 'roll' your ice cream from the other side of the counter.\n\nsince i went near the end of the day, most of their flavours were sold out, so i tried \"love @ first bite\". presentation was a bit slacky in my opnion, compared to the pictures on their instgram, but it may have because they still had lots of orders to complete. \n\nhowever, taste wise, the ice cream was delicious - not too sweet - and you can also tell that their whipped cream is made fresh and not from the can as it has that milky taste. \n\non the downside, i was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the matcha flavour anymore as i really wanted to try that one. \n\nit's a bit pricey at $7 for each \"polaroll\" but i think it's worth trying. \n\ni may go again to try \"taro with a twist\" but if they bring back the matcha flavour, i will definitely be coming back to try it.", 4], ["Oh my goodness, even if this place were in the actual Arctic, I would try and figure out how I could get here. We have a husky, so I guess that's a start. She could pull us on a sled. Now I just need about fifteen additional huskies, a sled, a parka, some boots, heavy gloves, and training in dog sledding. Oh wait, it's in Toronto. Unfortunately, I'm still from the United States, so I guess I'll need to apply for Canadian citizenship so I can move into the closest available apartment to Arctic Bites and eat here everyday and die happy.\n\nThis was instantly the best ice cream I've ever had. And I know \"best I've ever had\" is a phrase people use way too liberally, but I didn't even have to think about it here. The flavors are limited, with only eight total, but they're very complex and feature flavorsome recipes. My choice, the Taro With a Twist, comes with: taro and coconut ice cream, mochi balls, coconut shreds, and condensed milk drizzle.\n\nAnd who knew ice cream could be constructed? You get to watch as magic unfolds right before your eyes (or science, whatever). They pour your ice cream batter all over the freeze-dried grill. Then they play with it until it hardens (tee hee!). This involves slathering it out and molding it until it's hard against the surface, then chiseling it off into rolls.\n\nIf you are visiting Toronto, make this a must. If you live in Toronto, you're among the luckiest people on the face of the earth.", 5], ["Got the Thai Me Up around $8, everything in store in generally around that price range, for the amount of food I definitely think it's a little pricy. The specific one I got was very oily and sweet, and my friend who got a different one also agrees on the oiliness. \nWatching the people make your ice cream was fun though, so recommended if you have never tried before and want to experience a little, but not a place I would want to go back!", 2], ["So glad I finally got to try this place. If you like taro order the taro coconut and make sure to add in chopped oreos. Do it and thank me after! The earl grey and the mango were also good", 5], ["Went here today and ordered the strawberry and Thai flavoured ice cream. Both were very delicious and the portion size was more than enough for one person. Will definitely be coming back.", 5], ["The thrill of the experience is watching them roll the ice cream. Had the Thai ice cream, wasn't too bad. Went a few months ago, waited about an hour (the end of the line was at the door and only had two stations going). It's one of those places that you only go once - it's quite expensive ($10) for 5 rolls of icecream.", 3], ["The neat part of the experience is the \"show.\" You get to see how the cup of liquid turns into a sheet of ice cream. It's quite amazing how it's done and presented. The ice cream is not that sweet, so the additional sweet garnishing is a definite compliment. The only drawback is the lineup. One needs to either pick the right time or be fortunate enough to be there when it's not that busy. But, it's a great place nonetheless to mingle while you wait and watch.", 4], ["After jealously watching videos of rolled Thai ice cream being made in Thailand, I was ready to hop on a plane to cross the Pacific to get some. But then the trend eventually moved into New York, which made it more within my reach. And it just so happens that Toronto is pretty close to NY, meaning the craze was also hitting Toronto. And lucky for me, I just so happened to be visiting. Thus my visit to Arctic Bites. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, let me tell you - it was utterly fantastic. I mean, I was a little worried that the novelty of it wouldn't stand up to the quality of it, but boy, is that wrong. The ice cream was creamy and so flavorful. I ended up with the Mr. Grey (Earl Grey Tea flavor), and my boyfriend had the Taro With a Twist (Taro Coconut flavor). \n\nWe were both amazed at how yummy they were. And my boyfriend claims it's the best ice cream he has ever had in his life. I have to say it's definitely one of my top favorites of ice cream I've ever had, and I've had quite a bit in my time. My ice cream had a potent earl grey tea flavor, and my boyfriend's definitely had strong taro and coconut flavors. I felt that the toppings complemented the ice creams well without overpowering the intended flavors. \n\nWe did have to wait outside for about 10 minutes on a Wednesday afternoon (they have a bouncer, essentially, to let people in) so people don't overcrowd the small space inside. You go up to a register to order and pay first, and then you move along in the line and watch the employees make the ice cream. \n\nMy boyfriend got his first, and he hardly ever raves about ice cream, but Arctic Bites quickly got a positive comment after the first bite. And when I finally got a taste of mine, I understood what he meant. Seriously, this place is good. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, maybe you don't know what good ice cream actually is. \n\nOverall: 5/5\nFood: 5/5\nService: 3/5 - Cashier was friendly enough, but the little boy picking up my ice cream rolls and putting toppings on was ruining my Instagram-worthy ice cream. My boyfriend got a perfect bowl (from a chick), but mine was all squished and lopsided with no art to the toppings. Yes, I'm actually griping about that. There is an art to food, and he had no skills. \nAtmosphere: 2/5 - Small space with no seating inside or out.", 5], ["This place serves up some good ice cream, with interesting toppings but there are some things that just don't make me think it deserves all the hype. \n\nDoes freshly rolling the cream into ice cream rolls improve the eating experience?\nI'd say no. I can't taste the difference. The rolls don't stay rolls for very long (probably because of the increased surface area that allows it to freeze so quickly on the ice tables is also the reason it melts so fast... science people) so the effort in making the rolls is lost. THERE ARE NO BENEFITS OF MAKING THE ICE CREAM INTO ROLLS. \n\nAlso I feel bad for the people making the rolls because you can see they wear wrist support/brace to combat the insane repetitive stress their arms/hands must endure to make the rolls. \n\nReally the ice cream does taste good, but not better than a traditional scooped ice cream, so the gimmick of making the rolls fails, and is dangerous for their employees. In addition the LINE UPS ARE INSANE. The whole process is unnecessarily complex. I am all for culinary innovation, but rolls are not the future.", 3], ["I have been here a few times. I don't know much about Hong Kong style food, but the food here is really good. I am pretty snobby with Chinese food and this place is one of the few places I will go to. The first time I went I was a little scared because it felt very bare-boned/sketchy but get past that and you will have some great food.

After finally trying this place I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.\n\nThe menu was fairly extensive and ranged from lighter options such as sandwiches to HK style milk tea to pork chop rice. The best way to describe the food at Hong Kong Cafes would be filling, inexpensive comfort food. There were several items I wanted to order but decided on the pork chop with tomato sauce and rice (you have the option of rice or spaghetti). The waitress also brought me a bowl of hot soup to start which was great. When my rice arrived I was happily surprised at the portion size and how delicious the food looked. I quickly dug in and was very pleased with the taste of the food. The tomato sauce was plentiful and a bit sour like I prefer and the pork chop was nice and crispy on the outside. It was an enjoyable meal and I was stuffed when I was finished with the food.\n\nThe service was good here as the staff were all friendly and checked in on me often. Many of the people that came in seemed to be regulars so there was a lot of friendly chit chat between the customers and the staff which gave the place a friendly vibe.\nThe restaurant itself is not overly big but offers a fair amount of seating.

My friend got the steak (which was actually cooked medium rare, with the fruit salad in mayo sauce appetizer, and a hot lemon tea. The appetizer were good, and came quickly. The entrees were huge, and tasted delicious with the classic Chinese black pepper gravy. The tea is not what you come here for, but it wasn't bad, just not noteworthy in terms of Chinese tea. Both of our meals also came with a soup option that was the classic Chinese borscht - that is more tomato soup than borscht. \n\nService is pretty average, but food is fast, so I was happy!

The ambiance is a bit cramped and noisy, but that's to be expected in Chinatown. \n\nThe one thing I found off-putting was the presence of dirty glassware on cashier counter-top.

Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.\n\nHK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.\n\nI have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season.

There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken, which was perfectly cooked as it was tender yet had nice crispy edges. For $11, you get a giant portion and I could only finish about half of it. \n\nThe baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce comes in a large dish but it does take some time to cook. It was very good - the crispy pork chop pieces were tasty and they certain don't skimp on the meat portion compared to the rice. \n\nLastly, I never pass up the opportunity to get their HK-style milk tea.

Either way just peruse the other Yelp reviews to figure it out. \n\nDef come to Saku for some affordable good sushi rolls dt.", 4], ["I ordered takowasabi (octopus marinated in wasabi sauce), miso eggplant and sashimi a la carte (unagi) via Foodora since I see my fave place for takowasabi (Kinko Izakaya) no longer has it for delivery.\n\nThe tako wasabi was really good, with a perfect texture. The miso eggplant was plentiful and decent. Unagi was kind of expensive for 5 pieces, and not too plentiful. It was chilled, which was weird. A few pieces of lettuce somewhere would've been nice. \n\nExpensive, but good.", 4], ["This is a fancy place designed for quality and the roll that captivated me to order was the Saku roll - couldn't deny the description of scallops and B.C. tuna, it was a tasty meal. The only issue for me was that it was definitely not enough to get me full so this'll be a place that you need to splurge to get the maximum benefit - if you're all for quality and willing to sacrifice the feeling of being full, this is the spot! Unfortunately I need to feel full to be in ease hence the three stars.", 3], ["A shell of what it used to be. It was 11/10 beyond excellent when it first opened, but the quality has declined every year after. They don't even use real albacore/white tuna anymore, now they use Escolar fish. (search Escolar vs White tuna on Google for a side by side comparison). I used to come here specifically because they actually used real white tuna.\n\nThe salmon wasn't as fresh either. They're also serving \"spicy salmon roll\" for the lunch combos, which is basically undesirable trimmings of salmon mushed together with tempura bits and spicy mayo. Salad is now just lettuce (it used to be a very good salad with lots of variety and even edible flowers).\n\nThe value is bad. This is the price of a mid-range sushi restaurant but with the quality of a take-out. I'd rather get kibo.", 2], ["Great place with a modern feel, there is an enormous amount of sake to be tried. That being said it doesn't feel much like your usual sushi place! The sashimi prices are high and the quantity is low! The place seems more suited towards being a sake speciality bar and there's no problem with that!", 4], ["I've been back to Saku Sushi twice since I've written my first review.\n\nHere are some changes that I wanted to make to it and note the things that have stayed the same.\nFirst of all, the orders have differed\n1. Black Dragon Roll: Must get every time, big ass roll that tastes delicious & PACKED.\n2. Sunshine Roll: I loved it the first time I got it but somehow during the second time it came out somewhat soggy (?) so I'll pass on this from now on\n3. Seafood Nabeyaki Udon: Still in love with this. The soup is savory and yummy. This is packed with seafood. The udon is chewy and filling.\n4. I don't remember what we ordered exactly from the classic rolls but I do remember saying to my fam that we should just take to the Signature ones instead.\n\nThe service here fluctuates from amazing to somewhat uhm.\nPROS: \nI am seated every time on time for my reservation (yay). The first plate of food is always brought out within the first 10 minutes. The servers are somewhat hard to catch if you need refills or your cheque. \nCONS: \nAt the end of my meal when I was still eating from my udon bowl, a waitress came and cleared my ENTIRE table which consisted of my napkins, my chopsticks, and my little soy sauce dish which I was still using :( I didn't realize she was going to take it until it was too late.\nThen as I asked for the cheque, one of the waitresses who had WET hands handed me the machine so now my hands are wet from whatever she touched (WHAT DID SHE TOUCH?!)\n\nI paid around $60 including tip for 2 - 2 signature rolls & the seafood nabeyaki udon.\nOverall, I think Saku is alright but I'm ready to try new places for some consistency. I'm going to try their sister restaurant The Haam and other a la carte restaurants in the area.", 3], ["always enjoy their sushi \nVery creative and good quantity \nGood quality too! \nLike this cocktails too and the must-order eggplant side dish! \nWill recommend to book reservation in advance \nWaitress are all really polite and quick!\nWill go again for sure!", 5], ["I was excited to try Saku Sushi after reading all the good reviews online. However, I was not blown away by my experience. I think perhaps though it was because I went in with the wrong expectations. Saku is definitely more of a fusion sushi restaurant, and for me, was a little bit too fusion-like. For fusion sushi, I prefer the Haam.", 3], ["For the very affordable price, this is pretty good sushi. The aburi and pressed sushi seem to be really popular here in Toronto and I wanted to try them while visiting for a quick work trip. There were a number of higher end options but I wanted to stay casual and picked a more hole in the wall option. Saku is simple and easy with hip hop music, and a relaxed crowd. I sat at the sushi bar and by 6:15 on a Monday night, the place was almost at capacity. \n\nI kept it simple, glass of white wine, edamame, and the assorted aburi sushi platter. The $25 platter yields 12 individual nigiri pieces that have all been plated together and then slathered with sauce and torched. The aburi style is interesting but does completely overpower the taste of the fish. Or at least the way Saku does it overpowers. \n\nThe fish was of average quality from what I could tell and the torched flavor was nice but 12 pieces for one person was way too much. I recommend getting individual pieces or a different platter where you can mix and match aburi with classic nigiri. After the 4th piece, they all started to taste the same to me. \n\nI'm glad I was able to try the aburi but also wishing I had shot for possibly a more delicate place where the extra flavors enhance the fish, not disguise it. Service was very attentive when I first got there but slowed down once the place got busy. It took a while to flag someone down for my check (and they don't take AMEX to top it off). \n\nDefinitely a reasonably priced sushi spot for those not looking to spend a ton and still get a decent quantity but the quality is equivalent to what you pay for.", 3], ["I just went again recently and I don't feel the same anymore. The fish quality is like PROJECT:FISH now where you can't really taste the fish. I got the Assorted Aburi Sushi  ($25 for 12 pieces) and the 2 piece uni ($8). Could not taste the fish in any of the Aburi pieces and the sauces were really muted. Barely any taste in all 12 pieces. If there was a blind tasting done, I would think it's just plain rice. If I were to come back, I would not order the Aburi again. It's still a hot deal but I prefer to pay for food with taste. The uni was pretty decent but I've had really bad uni so nothing can be that bad unless it's worse than that or close to it.  Also, at $8 dollars, that's a steal! Possibly the cheapest I've ever paid for uni ever.\n\nHonestly, pretty disappointing experience because I really liked this place before and now the sushi is very meh.", 3], ["Romantic atmosphere and great presentation! A bit expensive but tasted great! Ordered:\n\nAssorted Aburi Sushi - Absolutely loved it, would recommend. Different flavours were all so rich and wholesome.\n\nUnagi Pressed Sushi - Torched taste alongside the umami in the sauce, loved this one too!\n\nSaku Special Roll - ordered because it had a name similar to the store, wasn't bad but not worth $15. Would've much rather ordered another pressed sushi set instead. \n\nOverall, great taste but a tad expensive. The meal seen below (all three) totals to a bit over $60 with tax.", 4], ["Went on a date here and the missed the rush hour which was nice. The rolls were delicious and the lions roll and ocean dream roll was amazing. Specials on wine and beer were a nice touch. The Christmas drinks were festive and packed a punch. Definitely would return. Price was great for all we had.", 5], ["Great place for sushi. I tried the Atlantic Queen and Spider roll. Both great choices but I preferred the Spider roll because of the crunch. Service was good but it did take quite some time for the food to arrive and also to get the bill at the end. Regardless I would still come back for more.", 4], ["Amazing birthday dinner! \n\nMy family and I eat a lot of sushi, but this place did not fail to blow us away!  They had many different items that we hadn't seen before, and put new touches to classic dishes.  Also, their special rolls were unlike any other!  Everything we ate just tasted so fresh and delicious.  \n\nTheir Bibimbap was amazing, as it came with a sauce giving it a lot more flavour.  Everything just worked so well in the stone bowl, and we all wished we could bring one home! \n\nThe Ocean Dream Roll was definitely a family favourite, as that cucumber garnish added a nice texture and flavour to the already amazing roll. \n\nTheir Salmon Sushi Pizza was also brilliant!   My family and I always make sure to order one, every sushi restaurant we go to so we can compare, and Saku knocked it out of the park!  I strongly recommend ordering that, along with some classic Salmon Sashimi (which is phenomenal here). \n\nLastly, for the food, I ordered a green tea cheesecake, and it just made me so happy :) .  It was so light and YUM.  Perfect way to end the meal. \n\nAnd of course, the service was so lovely!  Our waitress was so pleasant, and she told us all about the menu, answered all of our questions, and even recommended a great \"first legal drink\" for me, haha :) . \n\nI just really really wish this restaurant was down the street from my house!  I would be there all the time!", 5], ["Had a lovely dinner with family on a Sunday evening. We made reservations since it gets busy and was promptly seated the moment we walked in the door. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of items for the table and everything was fresh, delicious and well balanced in flavour. The sashimi was so fresh and sweet. My favourite roll of the night was tied between the island roll and the volcano roll. The island roll has a thin layer of dried yam on top which gave a sweet and crunchy element but did not overwhelm the taste of the scallops. The volcano roll was fun, with crispy potato bits on top that lent a crunch factor to the roll but at the same time was so well balanced in flavour that even the spicy salmon didn't overwhelm everything. \n\nThe price is on the more pricey side (a roll is easily $15) but there is real quality and thought in each dish.", 4], ["Tried the pressed sushi and wasn't impressed. I got the premium pressed sushi because it had everything I liked ie scallop, sweet shrimp, and uni. Though I regretted it once it came. I thought they were going to come sliced and layered but instead the shrimp and scallops were minced and put on top. It was like they put a very thin layer on top of a brick of rice that wasn't even soft.\n\nI'm not exactly sure why pressed sushi is popular here but it's a terrible version of sushi. Sushi rice should be fluffy and melt in your mouth with the fish.\n\nI also got the uni which was very little portion but tasted ok. The raw shrimp was good but the shrimp heads weren't fried enough. Back home the shrimp heads are fried so nicely I can eat the whole head but here I could only take one bite because it wasn't crispy just hard.", 2], ["This place went over my expectation. I was expecting more of a casual dinner when I stepped into the store around 6PM on a weekday (the restaurant already had a line out by the time we left). Good atmosphere and they seem to have a variety of cocktails with a nice bar set up.\n\nFor the food, we got\nAppetizer:\n - Fried softshell crab \n - Corokke (Fried potato balls)\n\nMain:\n - Fried shrimp roll\n - Lion King roll\n\nThe fried appetizers were delicious, especially the fried softshell crabs. They had fried potato sprinkles all over the dish, which made it aesthetically appetizing and tastefully beautiful. The rolls, especially their signature rolls such as Lion King roll we got, were MASSIVE. We thought we would need to order more, but we left satisfied and full. The tab totaled about ~60 CAD which is not a bad at all in that neighborhood. Would come back!", 5], ["I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. This is a restaurant that, unless you are looking for it, you may completely miss it.  The name Saku Sushi doesn't hit your eyes.  What made me stop was the Sake specials they had that made me wonder what the restaurant was. I was not disappointed when i walked in. \n\nClean, roomy, and a wonderful ambiance.  We were seated immediately and were brought water to start. The menu has lots of variety, from apps to rolls, rice bowls and bento boxes. \n\nWe ordered the premium sashimi platter, Atlantic Queen and the Lobster roll.  The food came quite quickly which was wonderful and the flavours were explosive. \n\nPremium Sashimi Platter:\nOrganic salmon, Uni, Scallop and Sweet Shrimp. The salmon was cut a little thick for my taste, but still very fresh.  Uni was good, not the best I've ever had, but still very satisfying. The scallops and shrimp had a certain sweetness to them that were to DIE FOR. Absolutely delicious.\n\nAtlantic Queen:\nTorched salmon on top, the sauce was beautifully paired on top.  It was a bite to eat and very satisfying. \n\nLobster Roll:\n\nThick chunks of lobster fried, throughout the roll.  It is definitely a mouthful. But just enough rice to keep everything together. \n\nAll the ingredients in the rolls were fresh. Delicious. The prices were decent, average I would say.  The service was wonderful.  The waitresses were sweet and would come by to make sure that everything was good a few times during our meal.  They cleared plates as needed and kept watch for when we needed more water without us requesting it. \n\nI would hands down come back here again. Wonderful food.", 4], ["Great staple spot for sushi downtown. It won't blow your mind away but you can't go wrong here! Try to get reservations in advance. \n\nAtmosphere: Decent prices and fun interior.

Used the checkin discount for 10% off one special roll. Would probably come back to dry other rollls too.", 4], ["The sushi here is actually pretty good. I got the half order of the chef's special and the fish was fresh. I like that its Japanese style in the sense that the sushi doesn't  have a huge block of rice.

I'd definitely order from there again... and I'm a bit of a sushi snob!", 4], ["Absolutely delicious.

Husband got kalamari and it was good. But each meal roughly $20-23 when upgrade to greek salad... And i dont think the price justified the overall quality... Wont be coming back", 3], ["Ordered delivery for dinner. Tried the chicken souvlaki.\n\nI placed the order at 6pm and it arrived just a few minutes shy of 7:30. That was really too bad for me because it was really important for me to eat by 7:30. I only had 3-4 minutes to eat. I thought that placing the order at 6 meant it would be there around 7 at the latest but I wish I had placed my order sooner. I called the restaurant after the first hour or so of waiting and he told me about circumstances beyond their control that had ended up backing up all of their delivery orders. He explained and apologized. He said mine was on the way and about 20 minutes later it arrived. The delivery driver did not apologize he just thanked me.\n\nPlacing the order, the man on the phone was nice and very efficient. He obviously takes a lot of orders and he tries to make the process fast and easy for you. \n\nI enjoyed my dinner but to be honest, it wasn't so good that I was able to look past the super delay in delivery and the lack of an apology from the driver. I'm not saying it was his fault and I know he was probably having a stressful night, but I was surprised he didn't mention anything to me after I had been waiting for so long. But I think I could have overlooked all of it and chalked it up to a bad night if the food had completely blown me away. It wasn't as good as some other Greek restaurants I have tried. So, I won't personally be a returning customer for delivery or in restaurant again. Everything was good but nothing was great- the pita was good but slightly charred/burnt (or is that how people like it?) the chicken and tzatziki was good, the salad was pretty good as were the rice and potatoes. Portions were generous. I couldn't finish the meal and I was full.\n\nI know for sure that there are better Greek restaurants, and there are better delivery experiences and I mean that in terms of taste and value as well. When I read through Yelp reviews, a lot of people were impressed with how fast it came and some people were disappointed for how slow delivery was. Too bad my first experience wasn't a great one and the food didn't quite make up for it.", 3], ["I have only ordered delivery and never eaten in the dining room, so my review is based on their take out menu. \n\nI have tried several Greek restaurants and always find myself coming back to Mykonos! Their portions (with the exception of the chicken in their Souflaki dinners) are quite generous and the quality of the food is very good. I am especially fond of their Greek fries and tsatziki. \n\nNot the cheapest but overall very good. The delivery man and restaurant staff on the phone are all very friendly. Delivery is almost always on time or faster than expected.", 4], ["Named after a beautiful Aegean island, Mykonos is a little Greek oasis west of the danforth, located near Rosedale station. \n\nI've never been inside, so I hesitate to recommend dining (based on other reviews, I'm sure you can see it's quite highly rated). However their delivery is phenomenal: fast, hot, delicious, and stuffed with fluffy extra pita and tzatziki.\n\nWe've ordered the grilled calamari, the veggie moussaka, the mezedakia trio, and the saganaki. All dishes are delicious. Here's some quick advice for takeout/delivery:\n\nFirst: they come fast, so don't be literally caught with your pants down, and get dressed as soon as you put your order in. Maybe be dressed as you make the call, I don't know, I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life!\n\nSecond: if you're tolerant of lactose, you should always get the saganaki, because theirs is incredible, and it's just as good the next day or even the day after. Watch your reheating times though: it melts quick. Definitely do NOT try to set your cheese on fire at home, kiddos - leave it to the pros.\n\nThird: The \"Kalamari Dinner\" is good, comes with a few potatoes and some veggies (which are indeed tasty), but I personally find that the calamari \"Hot Meze\" is better value. It just comes with Tzatziki, but will save you 6 dollars.\n\nFourth: The moussaka is huge and dense. Even if you're really hungry, it's a pretty full meal on it's own (You should still get the saganaki though, duh.)", 4], ["On New Years Day, I ordered a souvlaki dinner for myself and my girlfriend. Thankfully, without having to wait too long, the delivery dude showed up with my order of large souvlaki chicken dinner and my girlfriend's small pork souvlaki dinner. \n\nMy first reaction upon opening my food was \"Ooh, I think they messed up the sizes.\" Even though I had ordered the large one, my girlfriend's plate had more food (meat, rice and veg) in it. All the contents in the bowl were identical. However, we are really comparing apples and oranges, so I am not sure if the folks at Mykonos messed up or not. My review of the food in general is that it's pretty good for a delivery food. I think the plus was that they used the breast meat for the chicken, yet manage to not make it completely dry. It was pretty juicy and I think they had just enough amount of char on the outside for my liking (i.e. not a lot). The veggies and potatoes were pretty much standard affair. Veggies were nothing to write home about, and I was just glad that potatoes were not entirely bland. I liked the salad that they packed for its dressing. The salad itself looked kinda sad. Reminded me of those garden salad mixes you buy at Loblaws. I tend to like dressings with strong vinegar smell, and this one had that. I was really hungry, so I was able to finish the whole thing, but if I was not as hungry, I think I would not have been able to finish. I think the portion was generous (save for chicken), and I think over all, the food earns a solid 3.5/5\n\nMy girlfriend (a big fan of Greek food) enjoyed the food, but I think she also finds the food little shy of being comparable to other Greek food that she has had. She did not like the sourness of the potatoes, but she thought the other parts of the food were done pretty well.  She did not end up finishing her meal (because of the portions), but she was satisfied. She agrees with me that in terms of the food quality, this place would be like 3.5/5. \n\nOverall, this place gets a solid 3.5 from me. In fact, if the delivery was a bit quicker, I would have rated this place 4/5.", 3], ["I confess I order delivery much more often than I stop in to eat. I suspect they do a brisk take out business. The quality, customer service and consistently good food keeps me coming back. My parents also love this place and always suggest it when they are in town visiting.

And best of all- my dog feels at home on their patio in the summer.", 5], ["Gyros are AWESOME here. Tzaziki is tart, fresh and thick. Perfect for dipping with grilled pita bread.

They also gave us a complimentary sampler platter. One of my favourite Greek spots in Toronto.", 5], ["Very disappointing experience. I got a small chicken souvlaki dinner ($16) and a large pork souvlaki dinner ($18). Both included very little meat. The pork souvlaki, being large, did not contain any more meat than the small chicken souvlaki. The dinner also included rotten broccoli, and roots of the vegetables. The quality of the food is simply unacceptable. I strongly advise that you stay away from this place, and of course I will not be returning to this restaurant.", 1], ["First time eating here.

An embarassment to Greek food. Poor food quality. Chicken souvlaki dinner contained 3 small pieces of chicken. . Large Greek salad was extremely disappointing.

I can't believe there weren't more people here on a Saturday night but it sits sort of by itself short walk from more populated neighborhoods. The Lemon rice soup was best we've ever had! Very affordable.", 4], ["This is a hidden gem of a restaurant in an area that lacks nearby shopping and other restaurants. I have been going here for about three years now, and it is my go-to for Greek food. I have dined in, have ordered take out, and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality. It trumps the Greek restaurants on the Danforth where I find the food can often be too salty and oily.\n\nThe food is delicious and the customer service is great. My favourite dish is the village salad (big fresh chunks of peppers, cucumbers, onions, feta, and olives) topped with either grilled chicken, grilled calamari, or grilled shrimp. The grilled calamari is one of the best I have had, but you really can't go wrong with any of the three! The chicken souvlaki is also great. Even the small size is quite large, so if you order the regular size, be prepared to bring home leftovers! My friend ordered the Greek chicken wrap for take-out and it was massive - like two meals in one! I also really enjoy the complimentary grilled pita they give you as an appetizer topped with olive oil and garlic (they also provide this with all take out and delivery orders). It is especially yummy dipped in their hummus.\n\nIn addition to the quality of the food, the prices are fantastic! Especially given that within a five minute walk from the restaurant you will pay twice the price for half of the food. The owners and servers are very kind and more than willing to accommodate you and your dietary preferences (I don't like the olives or feta with my village salad). It is definitely a family-friendly restaurant and I am always impressed that they remember my favourite orders. You don't come here for the ambiance as it is more of a homestyle restaurant, but you come for the food and service!", 5], ["Pros: Large portions, delicious potatoes, Santorini chicken was flavourful and stuffed with a nice amount of feta and spinach \n\nCons: Moussaka was awful! I love moussaka but this one went straight in the garbage. It tasted like burnt veg and what I imagine wallpaper paste to taste like. So disappointing.

Of course, it was great to see them and show them around but when it came to dining out, oy. \n\nYou see, my brother-in-law is a bit of a pain in the ass, er...I mean, a bit of a picky eater. Anything I consider interesting and tasty, he wrinkles his nose at because it's too pungent/funky/different/weird. You know what I'm talkin' about; every family has that one taste bud-challenged person who puts the kibosh on Thai/ Indian/ Korean/ Vietnamese-- basically, any vibrant cuisine with dishes that are hard to pronounce.\n\nSo when my sister said \"they\" (read: \"he\") found this restaurant near their hotel that they liked, I lowered my expectations and was prepared to be underwhelmed.\n\nMaybe that's why I was so impressed by their choice in Mykonos. It's an attractive neighborhood restaurant with huge portions of fresh Greek food at beyond reasonable prices, served by what is possibly the Nicest Waitress in All of Canada.\n\nWe started with the Mezedakia Platter ($16) for the table: five homemade dips (tyrokafteri, melizanosalata, hummus, tzaziki, and taramosalata) served with olives and pita. Garlicky, bursting with flavor, just AMAZING. (And no, the brother-in-law did not partake in any of it. Too many Zs, Ks and vowels, I suppose.)\n\nNext, we had heaping portions of super-fresh salads ($7), grilled calamari ($11), mussels ($10), salmon($16), souvlaki ($17). Delicious, but none of us was able to finish the mounds of food on our plates. (Except the B-I-L who stuck to a nice, safe Caesar salad.) \n\nMykonos wasn't crowded that night so the Nicest Waitress in All of Canada was able to dote on my niece and nephew, and make them laugh with the restaurant's 3-foot-long pepper mill. Heck, she made me laugh, too.\n\nThey have a crazy cheap wine list and their homemade desserts are a steal at $4 a pop. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to dine at Mykonos but if I'm in the vicinity, I would definitely go back for the dips, grilled calamari, the NWiAoC, and the smug satisfaction that I can eat something more adventurous than a Caesar salad.", 4], ["I tried this place for the first time by placing an order for delivery on justeat.ca.

I would visit more frequently if their prices were a little lower, but otherwise their burrito was very good!", 4], ["This was the most normal thing I had all day at the Canadian National Exhibition, and close to the best. Su&Bu puts an Asian twist on nachos that completely turns away from the typical flavours, but makes something sweet, savoury, and new.\n\nThat being said, I don't know if I would normally like this. I was lucky since the guys who prepared mine accidentally put the far too large slices of jalape\u00f1o and the unnecessary cheese sauce at the bottom of the box. So thankfully I dodged those misguided bullets, and had an impressive meal.\n\nRegardless, I'm a fan of this dish. The wonton chips are very different from typical nacho chips, but still very satisfying. And more importantly, they're thick enough to scoop up the chunks of avocado and surprisingly fresh salmon. Everything comes together well with their sriracha aioli sauce and whatever the \"sweet sauce\" is concocted out of.", 4], ["Ordered one of the sushi burrito and it was my first sushi burrito ever! It's not bad although the $1 additional for imitation crab was a bit expensive. Also I was expecting the seaweed to be chewy since it became soft from the rice but actually it wasn't. One thing though I think the wax paper that wraps around the burrito should be changed since it smells so plastiky/toxic. Taro chips was ok. Can tell that some are fresh and some not. The seasoning on the chip is also not even. Some very salty and some very oily. \nOverall I would like to explore other poke bowl and sushi burrito places before coming back.", 3], ["Clean, fresh grub! Good quality and OMG the Sushi Nachos! For that alone I'd come back.", 5], ["What a fun spot! And the food!! My God that sushi burger....mmm\n\nI am so glad I discovered Su & Bu on instagram (thanks to local Elites @Anthony) it was love at first sight with the sushi burger. The colours and concept was so foreign - it made me curious! I mean sushi +burrito= genius! sushi never fills me up, a sushi burrito wrapped in  noori that pretty much resembles a handroll is a perfect portion to kill a craving on the go.\n\nOn the same day as landing in the 6ix, I headed here for dinner. The venue is a cute compact fast food joint that resembles the design of many Montreal resto like Red Tiger or les street monkeys. The space is shared with another small bubble tea business. \n\nRating in 5*\nI ordered the sushi burger-10$ *****(very flavourful, spicy kick- picture two sushi pizzas making the bun of the burger and the inside containing salmon, crab meat, seaweed salad filling with spicy mayo - divine! Good for one person) ; taro chips -3$ ***(tad oily, served in a large bag tasted like plantain chips) ; Pok\u00e9 nachos-11$*(DO NOT RECOMMEND - unless you order without cheese whiz, yes the yellow stuff in a jar-it's too overpowering);Sensai burrito -1/2 portion -9$**(too small for one person ; bland, needed more salt and seasoning.)\n\nFood was made relatively quickly. However, customer service was a little off-the employees looked really unhappy - Sweet Jesus!(Play on words? :D- popular dessert spot next door) despite the quality of service-I'll be back for the food !", 4], ["I was in the neighborhood and revisited SU&BU after an invitation from the owner. \n\nThe Sensei burrito was great. Salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, carrote, sweet chlli and SU&BU Sauce are a delicious combination! I adore the creaminess of avocado juxtaposed with crisp shrimp tempura!  Everything tasted fresh! \n\nI will definitely visit  SU&BU again if I am in the area!", 4], ["(Rating should be 4.5, Yelp does not allow for 0.5 stars). We visited from out of town, and my hubby bought a couple to rolls to enjoy at the hotel. I was a little skeptical at first, especially since we enjoy a lot of sashimi at home and try to be very selective about freshness. I also get a little wary of \"new kinds of Asian foods,\" so to speak. (No offense, but foods like at PF Chang's is not my thing.)\n\nI was pleasantly surprised - SO delicious and tasty! We split a Samurachi and Sensai roll so that we could both try each, and we LOVED them. Neither is a burrito nor sushi in the traditional sense, but my my they were amazing! I ate them like a burrito, as did my husband, who added a bit of wasabi and soy sauce also. \n\nMy hubby preferred the Sensai (it had shrimp tempura) while I preferred the Samurachi, as the red cabbage and chili viniagrette added an unexpected dimension of flavor! The Sensai roll had imitation crab, but shrimp tempura, tuna, and salmon were very satisfying. The fish was very fresh and flavorful, and the added items in each roll, despite being so numerous, did not overpower them, as I believe the fish should be the \"star\" of the dishes. We'll probably go again before our vacation is over!!!", 4], ["This place rocked. I wish I could have it again. I honestly had dreams about this meal afterwards. It's a pretty relaxed environment and the guys there were super nice, kinds, and willing to answer the million questions that we had. They have plenty of gluten free options and were well versed on what options they had available and prep safety. I opted for the shrimp tempura sushi burger. They make a rice patty, and then tempura they rice patties as the bun. From there they put all the fixings of the roll on to the bun as a burger. Wrap, cut, and enjoy. This was absolutely delicious. From the sauces they used on the \"bun\" to the fresh flavors of the individual parts. Everything just worked so well together to create a savory flavor explosion in your mouth. My girlfriend opted for the sushi burrito and absolutely loaded it up with goodies and and extras. She was just as please as I was with my meal. I will make it a point to go back to this place when I'm in the area. One of the best meals I had during my weekend trip to Toronto.", 5], ["Came here for lunch and had the tofu poke which I enjoyed a lot.

Earn points and enjoy a delicious sushi burrito!!\n \nWe ordered their fan favorite poke nacho bowl. Half a gringo burrito and the samurachi sushi burrito. Delicious.", 4], ["It took me a while to find a poke bowl that suits my tastebuds but I've finally found it here at SU&BU! \n\nI went with their fish poke bowl here and it was just PACKED with so many different types of ingredients. This bowl has everything in it, and it just worked. I've been wanting to eat a good premade bowl and this is it. It might be too much for some people, but if you're that type of person that likes getting everything for your subs, pizzas, and burgers, get this! There's a lot of sweet flavours in this bowl coming from all the mangoes, dragon fruit, seaweed salad, and pickled ginger. There's generous amounts of Tobiko, and avocado, and the fish was marinated nicely. There's no need for soy sauce at all, as the salt from the fish balances it out. \n\nThe downside is that their wasn't enough of this deliciousness. The portion size left you wanting more. I think while the toppings were plentiful, there definitely could have been more purple rice; I found myself eating more of the toppings, which is a weird complaint because more places tend to give your more rice than toppings. So a minor complaint here.", 4], ["Sushi burritos! I was walking up John street and was hungry so I decided to go in.  It's sandwiched between and ice cream and tea place.  \n\nI ordered a half salmon samba minus the jalape\u00f1o peppers.  Service was quite fast and I got my wrap to eat in the restaurant.  I was happy to see generous chunks of salmon sashimi in the wrap. The wrap was really stuffed so the nori sheet was busting at the seams so as I ate, the sushi burrito began falling apart. \n\nI recommend getting the takeout box along with a utensil so when it does fall apart towards the end, you have something to hold and eat it with! The flavor comes from the sesame based dressing and I liked how the taste of nori complements the purple cabbage and carrots.\n\nIt reminds me of a poke salmon bowl but in wrap format :d", 4], ["Been here twice and have not been disappointed! Both times I enjoyed the poke bowl and it was sooo fresh and delicious. A bunch of tuna and salmon accompanied by ginger, mango, dragon fruit, seaweed salad, taro chips, cucumber, fish roe on top of purple rice! The rice is glazed with a sweet soy sauce. All the ingredients alone are delicious on its own but when you mix it all together... I mean every bite is different. I am really pleased with the presentation (very Instagram-worthy) and it feels healthy. I don't feel disgusting after eating their poke bowl. \n\nDo give it a try. I am not a huge fan of their burrito since it's hard and messy to eat. the sashimi pieces are too big and when you take a bite, everything just falls apart. \n\nAnywho, give them a try. really good food and friendly staff. \n\nHappy Belly!", 5], ["Not a fan of the fish poke bowl as there's just too many weird toppings that I don't prefer in my bowl. Almost like it's trying too hard to stand out from all the other poke bowls in Toronto. This makes odd flavours stick out in ways that it shouldn't. However, I will give 2 thumbs up for the purple rice as that is much healthier than the usual white or even brown. \n\nI will say that their sushi burrito is much better and is way more simple with the usual toppings. This makes the sushi burrito taste way better as flavours are well blended. Got the Samurachi which I would recommend and order again.", 3], ["Had my first sushi burrito here.\nI'm not the biggest fan of sushi burritos because, like burritos, they get so messy and I end up eating half of it off the plate anyway. However, overall the sushi burrito was not bad. My partner loves the sushi burritos here.\n\nI also tried the nacho poke bowl. DO NOT GET THIS. It is so odd. And after a few bites, I just felt sick. So much sauce.\nI look forward to going back and trying the more traditional poke bowl next time! Overall, friendly and fast service, and decent quality ingredients!", 4], ["Shout out to SU &BU for having the worst\nPoke bowls ever. First ... They're TINY for $13 bucks and second you can't even customize and make your own. There are no sauces or options or spices. It's complete barf in a bowl. I honestly had a few bites and threw it out and went to Cali Love for another poke bowl ... I expected big things from this place and ugh so disappointed. I wish Union juice stayed here..!!!!", 1], ["Even the double is a small portion size. I was left feeling hungry.

Likely the best I have had to date. \n\nGo there now!!", 4], ["We've been here before and our experience was okay, so we decided to try again. Despite the place being empty, service was slow, especially for the bubble tea. I was already halfway through my poke bowl before I even got my drink. They didn't have tapioca OR even grass jelly so I had to change my drink order twice. Very disappointed.", 2], ["I got the fish poke without the shredded coconut. The taste was good and I liked that I got both salmon and tuna. The portions are small. \n\nThe service was very friendly which made it a great experience as well.", 4], ["I've only tried the sushi burrito here, and it was really good! There was really good rice to filling ratio (meaning they didn't skimp on the filling). Fish was fresh and flavours went well together. Service was friendly too.", 4], ["Came back 2 weeks later. Sensei roll was much fresher tasting and they now have opened up both doors! The packaging was a lot better this time and it fit perfectly inside the box compared to the first time. Nothing else to add or subtract, but they were a bit more efficient on orders than my first time there!", 4], ["My friend and I met up for lunch so I decided to give this place a try. We met at 1230 on a Thursday and I was surprised that it was not super busy. Both of us order the fish poke bowl and enjoyed their take of the dish. There were chips, mango, sashimi, avocado, seaweed salad and sauce but I did not notice the coconut.\n\nThere was one table for four and the rest were bar tops facing the window. There was the Presto tea beside but I didn't see anyone ordering from there. The bowl itself is different from other places but I think it was slightly more expensive as well.  Maybe it was due to the mango and other ingredients.  Not sure if I would return but it is an option for lunch although a bit far from my office.", 3], ["Compared to one of the other sushi burrito places I've been I'd say the fish was better, and the overall taste as well. It's a bit smaller than some of the others but the quality if there. I'd be interested to try the \"fish n chips\" on my next visit.", 4], ["Got the gringo delight. It was fresh and actually bigger than I had expected it to be. \n\nThe ingredients in the burrito blended well together, but it fell flat for me at the end of my first half because of the shrimp tempura tail that was still attached. I don't know if they forgot to cut it off or if that's how they serve it but when I'm mid meal, last thing I want to do is pull a shrimp tail out of my mouth. \n\nIn the end it was good. Relatively inexpensive. Will probably try again if I'm in the area.", 3], ["This is a completely westernized poke joint that uses the diced raw fish mixed in salad/rice.\n\nSushi Bagel ($3.99)\nThis looks bigger in pictures than in person. Thought it was cute and gave it a try. The \"bagel\" is actually a ring of marinated rice. I like how it wasn't just normal rice and its mixed in with some cooked tuna bits I think? which adds good flavor. The toppings on top of the rice are really thinly sliced, so just keep in mind this menu item is mainly for the rice.This was one of the most decently priced item on the menu.\n\nFish Poke ($11.99)\nNothing compared to traditional poke. A bowl of raw tuna, salmon, massago, avocado, mango, seaweed salad, ginger, and diced dragon fruit topped on purple rice and mixed kale salad. It says it's mixed in SU&BU sauce but I swear it tastes exactly like Teriyaki (the fast food chain) their specialty teriyaki sauce. This bowl was light and refreshing - an okay amount of protein, and not a lot of rice. Ingredients were fresh, tasty! Quite expensive for what you get imo.\n\nPoke Nachos ($9.99)\nCrispy wonton chips topped with raw salmon, raw tuna, massago, avocado, corn, green onions, cheese and drizzles of sweet sauce. I'm normally not a fan of nachos, but I liked this. Probably because it wasn't exactly nacho chips. It's supposed to be wonton chips but it felt more like shrimp chips but extra crispy - regardless, it tasted good. Love how the chips were super crunchy and with all the sauce the chips didn't get soggy at all. Decent amount of protein, and with all the ingredients the nachos were very flavorful and tasty. \n\nOverall, although this place is not authentic poke, but I would say one of the better poke bowl places. Just note that it is expensive if you want to eat enough to be full.", 4], ["My friend mentioned a sushi burrito place he liked near where he lived outside of Toronto. A few days later I was with another friend and we saw SU&BU, and since we both remembered the sushi burrito comment we figured we'd give it a try. It didn't disappoint.\n\nIt really isn't a burrito per se, just a gigantic hand roll, and thus tastes exactly how you'd imagine it would taste. That isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on how much you like hand rolls and sushi.\n\nThe fish and chips here are delicious, but also a gigantic mess. You could throw the thing in a blender and essentially it would look the same.", 4], ["They have potential for for their unique taste and style however, when it comes to sushi, we all know how important it is to have good tasting rice. The rice at SU&BU is quite soggy and mushy, that leaves the meal end off in a bad note. Tried out their poke and burrito with the same texture. \n\nHowever, I have to give credit for their Samurachi burrito as the vinegraitte in the roll is quite tasty. I had their Salmon Sambu roll last year at CNE and it was a bad experience for me as the fish wasn't the freshest. It still isn't quite up there but they definitely have potential to be better.", 3], ["One of the best poke places I've tried in Toronto. The fish poke ($12) was really fresh and the fresh fruit complimented it well. The prices are standard for poke but the rice to topping ratio is maybe 1:3 (poke bowls should be about the fish, not rice). However I do have to say that it's not filling enough for the price - one size only - as there is a spring mix salad and rice at the bottom. Would have liked more rice for that price. Comparable to North Poke in Kensington Market but not just quite.", 4], ["SU&BU was the first place that I tried a sushi burrito. I got the Gringo burrito and although tasty it was a bit hard and messy to eat.\n\nSU&BU was also the first place that I tried a Poke Bowl. Why wasn't this a thing earlier?! (It probably was, I was just never aware - excuse my ignorance for a moment.) I'm not a huge fan of raw fish, mainly because of the texture, but with all the toppings, you barely even notice it.

The burritos were quite filling and had a generous amount of fish in them. I fell in love with the Samurachi burrito, as the sauce was amazing. The presentation is really great too!

The staff is SO So SO NICE and patient, they r not busy, and even if they r busy they still take Enough time to explain a game for us until we finish two rounds of it, it's just so nice of them that we had so much fun and got to know a new great game. We had quite much experiences in snakes and latte  locations where we waited and waited and waited and no one came to help us pick a game or even get our orders, I would 100% choose A-game cafe over that !!!!!\n2.

Everything is very relaxed, and you can hang out here for as long as you like.\n\nSince we were all tabletop game newbies (having only played Monopoly and the like), one of the staff made a few recommendations with that in mind and introduced us to Ticket to Ride and Sagrada. They were both wonderful tabletop games, and he sat down with us for at least 10-20 minutes explaining every rule and walking us through the early turns for each of the games we tried. This is in contrast to other places like Snakes and Lattes where you'd be lucky for an employee to sit down at all, and when they do they would only quickly explain the basics and then leave to tend to the tons of other busy tables in the Cafe.\n\nThey also had Wong's ice cream and cones, but they only have a few flavours available each day.

The selection is pretty varied, from card games to Jenga to more intense board games where the rules mostly just go over my head.\n\nThe first time I went was pretty late at night so there were only a few people there, the second time I went in the late afternoon and it does get pretty busy and loud which is a nice atmosphere. It's not a big place so it could get full pretty quickly. \nThe food menu is limited, but they do have some good drink options! My go to is always the London fog, and it doesn't disappoint! \nThe prices are pretty reasonable, $3.5 for an hour and $7 for unlimited play, and honestly when you get into a game it's gonna be more than an hour, cause you know you need to get revenge if you lose. \n\nThe staff are also super nice, they'll make suggestions for games based on what kind of game you're interested in, or your experience with board games, and they'll take the time to actually teach you the rules of game play which i greatly appreciated! Saves a lot of time from figuring it out yourself. They also come by to check on you, make sure that you're not lost out of your mind. \n\nAll in all, it's a cute cozy little place, great staff, great game selections, would definitely come back again! \n\nAlso it's pretty cool that the artwork is actually for sale. Just a side note.", 5], ["There was absolutely no one at the cafe, and it was near lunch time. We decided to stay for only one hour, which is 3.50$. We ordered 2 iced coffees (3,50$ each). We left after about 20 minutes because we got so bored. We went to pay and he charged us 7 dollars for that amount of time we stayed, the total came to 15$ and it was supposed to be around 11$, he also didn't give us our change or a receipt. Terrible experience, would not suggest, never ever going back again.", 1], ["- love love this place, it is a bit pricier than snakes and latte but the customer service was great. There were people walking around showing you how to play so no need to spend an hour going through the instructions on the game box \n- I tried:\n    + tuna dip with crackers, the tuna was mixed with small slices of sweet peppers, pretty flavourful\n    + hot apple cider: it had strong taste of cinnamon but on a good side tho, I'm not a fan of cinnamon but really enjoyed this drink\n- Price: $5 for an hour and $7 for unlimited play \n- the place was small but I enjoyed it", 5], ["Fantastic service! Huge collection of games and the staff were very knowledgeable about all the games. They recommended a few and even taught us how to play. The ambiance is cute - lots of Harry Potter merch.

Being super accessible to subway (steps from Osgoode), its only competition in that category would be Roll Play, but A-Game has a cozier atmosphere, phenomenal staff and can't complain for the super affordable price of 3.5 per hour per person (max 7, can play all day/night!)\n\nThe selection here as others mentioned isn't as large as, say, Snakes and Lattes, but most likely they will have most games you would play (we sampled Telestrations and Catan during this visit). Also saw Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, Cards Against Humanity, Bang, King of Tokyo and so forth.\n\nThe menu is very reasonable and they're great with free water for the table. No pressure to order anything. The copies of all games are still in mint condition (amazing compared to more established places which are already showing wear/missing pieces). Owners informed us there is toonie Tuesdays ($2 flat rate all night!) and Settlers of Catan Mondays. Finally a great place to hang out with a large or small group downtown, will be back!!", 5], ["My wife and I came by here to play some games while on vacation from Philadelphia. We have been to many different board game cafes and played many different types of board games, and like to learn new ones when we have the opportunity to.\n\nWhat sets this place apart is that if you want, the owners Derek and Gary will sit down with you and teach your group a new game that you would like to try, but have never had the opportunity to play. They love gaming, and it shows. They will even join in to play if you'd like! I have never seen the staff at any board game cafe go out of their way to teach rules for games, give general strategic points, and play upon request. This is worth the price of admission alone. The prices are very reasonable as well.\n\nClean, no pressure, no minimums, no elitist gamer attitude, and super friendly. My wife and I will definitely be back when we are in town again.", 5], ["A new board game cafe in Queen West! They have opened up in the space above Ma Va Me, which was formerly a Spring Rolls.

Check it out!", 5], ["Board game Cafe.... Came here after work for a night of games but was kind of disappointed with the place as it has wooden tables and chairs.. Not a comfy setting.... The host however was very inviting and explained the games we wanted to play well.. Sat with us and ensures we understand the game would come here again.... We also got the tuna and Nutella sandwich both were good", 4], ["Another board game cafe in Toronto...and this one is great!  Went on a Friday afternoon and the owners were very attentive, picked and taught us games, and even played with us since we were the only people there.  \n\nThe board game selection is not as large as the other big game board cafes but it has the staple games you'll need.  Plus it's cheaper, much less hectic, and the service can't be beat.\n\nOverall this place is great, super awesome guys, can't wait to come back.", 5], ["Cute place to meet friends for a games night or have a date night. Good selection of games and great (!!) owners. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about every game we played.\n\nI'm definitely coming back :)", 5], ["I came here with a group for friends after dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday.

Snacks are not bad either", 5], ["Thump up for their friendly service. I have been there twice so far, both time the staff suggested board game based on group size, and taught us how to play, which saved time to read the instruction, leave us all the fun time to play.", 5], ["Far and away the best board game cafe in the city. Phenomenal owners & staff, great variety and condition of games, and most importantly an amazing community of people - fun to go alone or with a group.", 5], ["A-Game Cafe is a hidden gem in the entertainment district. My friends and I came here yesterday night for board games after we had dinner nearby. The cover charge for an hour is $3.50 and $7 for unlimited play over two hours; with no pressure to buy food or drink which I think is quite reasonable for a board game cafe. They have a good selection of games. What I particularly appreciated was the staff's friendliness and that they gave our group a reservation - not many board game places will book off tables for groups (they're usually first come, first serve/walk-in), but they did. :) We had a good experience overall - all the staff were very knowledgable about games, helpful and enthusiastic. Would recommend!", 4], ["Many board game cafes in Toronto have a great selection of games, a convenient location and a good menu, however what makes A-Game stand out is the attention and care that the owners put into every part of the guest experience. Derek & Gary's passion for games is evident in everything from the pristine condition of the games and impeccable cleanliness of the place, to the decor on the wall. You're not getting the most out of your visit to A-Game unless you chat with one or both of the brothers, and invite them to join you for a game. As the board game cafe craze continues to sweep Toronto, many venues lose sight of the fact that it's the people, not the games you play with - a quality that A-Game delivers on in spades.", 5], ["Awesome people, good selection of games, reasonable rates. Found this place through Meetup for \"Monday night Catan\" events and haven't gone anywhere else.", 5], ["A for coming back Again!\n\nWe were a party of 7 and sat comfortably at a large table. It's a sweet deal not having to line up for hours for a crowded space to play, on a Friday night. They charge $3.50 per hour or $7 for the whole night. Games are in mint condition and they've a decent selection. It was definitely a plus that they had all of our favourites - Catan, Seven Wonders, Dominion, Munchkin, Carcasonne..but the best part was the service. The owners were super friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and suggested games that we ended up loving. Our new favourites are now Machi Koro and Camel Up!  They also explained the games very well and were just fun to be around. \n\nHaving been to a few other cafes like Castle and Roll Play, I would definitely choose A-game over the others. Looking forward to my next visit!", 5], ["My friend was walking to dinner and saw a promotion for this board game cafe. So we decided that we should check it out.  I'm really glad that we did! Gary,  the main guy who helped us pick our games, taught us how to play Bang.  I lost after one round and he noticed that I was the only one that wasn't playing.  He suggested we play Monopoly Deal while my group continued Bang without me.  I thought it was a really sweet gesture! Overall I had a very great time and our group can't wait until they get their liquor license.  Would most definitely come again with other groups as well! The convenient location is also a big plus for me.", 5], ["Pretty good board game cafe. Small and cozy. Owners were very helpful in showing us the games and provided good recommendations.

Couldn't comment about the food since we only played games.", 4], ["My first time at a board game cafe and it was actually really fun! Popped in just to check it out and stayed for hours! They have a big array of games to suit anyone's preference. Staff are really great at helping you choose which games to play and will walk you through the instructions if you are new to the game. \n\nLocation is ideal, right downtown. Surprisingly good coffee as well! Make sure to try the London fog. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Toronto area.", 5], ["I was first introduced to A-Game by a friend with Groupon deal and then went again with a party of 7 with 2 groupon deals.

It made our surprise birthday party a success and we will definitely come back again!", 4], ["This is a pretty solid place I'd you want fun ice cream flavours and cute little doughnuts.\n\nI had the Cookie Monster ice cream which was basic vanilla cookies and cream with blue food colouring. The one thing I dislike was how it tinted my tongue blue for hours.\n\nAdditionally, there isn't much room to sit and enjoy your scoops.

Thankfully the place wasn't super busy the day I went!\n\nI definitely will come back the next time I'm in downtown Toronto!", 4], ["This little small dessert spot nestled in a busy Toronto area was a total gem.

The ice cream and donuts taste yucky.\n\nI came for the cookie monster ice cream but only wanted one scoop. Because I got one scoop instead of two, they would not put the little mini chocolate chip cookies on it, which is petty as fuk. If there weren't other people in the shop, I would have told him to stop being dumb and put two little cookies on the ice cream LOL \nThey also upcharged me an additional 0.99 for a small waffle cone...\n\nAside from this, the blue cookies-and-cream ice cream tasted like spoiled milk to be honest and otherwise flavourless. I threw it out. Didn't even finish it.\n\nThe donuts had this yucky vomit'y taste. They barely tasted like the flavours they professed to be even tho they had really cool options.  \nThe person I was with only had 3 bite-sized donuts and immediately felt sick.\n\nBy the way, the size of the donuts were much smaller than they appear to be. Theyre the size of Tiny Tom donuts.\n\nI DO NOT recommend this place.", 1], ["Amazing customer service and they deliver! We had 180 mini homer, Boston cream, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, s'mores, jam, and churro mini donuts for an event and they were a hit! They came delivered perfectly. Prices were the great as well.

Usually, I'm more of a soft serve person but this place definitely changed my mind. \n\nFirst time coming in, my boyfriend and I shared their signature Cookie Monster. It's a bit pricier than other desserts within the location, but the serving size is actually worth it - two big scoops of blue dyed cookies & cream ice cream topped with bite-size Chips Ahoy's on a cone. The hard serve's sweetness was just right at first, but halfway through the treat, I started to feel like it's over sweetened, which made sense. The cone itself is not really to my taste bud as the melted marshmallow (?) was too chewy and hard; however, my boyfriend really enjoyed it. Note for girls: definitely bring lipstick with you after eating as your lips and tongue will turn blue and it takes some time to fade.\n\nThe next day we passed by again (yes, my boyfriend and I do eat a lot of ice cream), we got 1 scoop each of Thai Milk Tea, Skor Brownie, and Hong Kong Milk Tea. Yum! Really enjoyed all the ice cream that we had, but my most favorite will be HK Milk Tea for its authentic flavor. \n\nHowever, since they also focus in donuts, the whole small enclosed area smells like frying oil, which will leave your clothes and hair with the same smell after 5 minutes. \n\nOverall, Fugo is a fun experience!", 4], ["Want to ruin your mood Friday right after work? Look no further than spending 40 minutes in greasey air hell at fugo desserts!\n\nToday I went and they didnt have my donut order ready.

They said their wifi was down and they couldn't get their online orders but....why dont you just keep making donuts in anticipation that you'll be seeing customers who did order online. \n\nInstead I'm waiting here when it's to be a quick pick up. My order isn't ready, they say 5-10minutes. Ugh.\n\nTime goes by I see so many boxes getting pumped out. Super annoying because none of them are mine. Even though those people aren't even here. Why do I have to wait literally 40 minutes for some  donuts that I PREORDERED online 2 hours ago. Why are they making orders for people who aren't here. Shouldn't you prioritize the person who has been waiting for so long and preordered??? \n\nI got my order after finally speaking up. Because for the second time they said my order was ready and it wasnt mines. After I told them my name. After I told them my order number. How can you keep getting it wrong?!\n\nI ask for compensation. Its been 40 minutes. I came at 4:25 and its 5:05 now. I point out those boxes behind the counter that have been sitting there for 40 minutes. Boxes of hundreds of donuts made after I came but no one picked up. They should have made mines first because I was standing there and came on time. (4:30 pickup). Might I add. Afterwards a lady came and stayed she ordered for picked up 4:45 and her order was ready! So what sequence were they really being made in? \n\nThey said they cant issue any refund to me because of their pos system...okay there. \n\nSo you think it's ok to have people wait 40 minutes for an order that they made online. And you think it's ok to make orders for people who aren't at your store yet while their orders sit for 40 minutes you could have satisfied at least one person by fulfilling their one measly order.\n\nTheir oil... always rancid smelling...ugh. you would think the smell filling the entire restaurant would be an indication that the oil is perhaps past it's time. But no. Everytime I'm here its reeks! And the taste goes in the donuts too.  And after I was forced to wait for 40 grueling minutes I left smelling like grease.\n\nI've never seen such an incompetent group of staff and managers ever. Manager cant issue a refund? I dont believe it. They fail to speak to me while there and only after putting them on blast on Instagram they call me back. Just a bunch of kids trying to be grown ups running a business. They dont have any sense of customer service, responsibility or ownership of mistakes. \n\nNow. I'm finally getting to my party. Late. Like the donuts I'm smelling like grease in my LBD and Charlotte Olympia flats. Thanks Fugo.", 1], ["Usually visit Fugo with friends when my sweet tooth kicks in. Let me start by saying that the ice cream here is more picturesque than a hillside sunset. Find a brick wall with some added saturation and you'll have a hit Insta pic on your hands.\n\nThe ice cream itself is a bit heavy. Not sure if it's the milk they use or the added ingredients but one cookie monster ice cream will be enough to fill you up for the entire day. If I have this after dinner I would usually feel way too full to function. \n\nThe store itself is pretty cute with lots of colorful walls.

The cool thing is that they make the donuts with their counter-top donut fryer on the spot so you know they're fresh.\n\nAs for flavor, they're all lightly flavored due to their small size.  They're best eaten within an hour or so but the bacon one ideally right away cause the bacon crumbs will get cold.  \n\nI liked the cookies'n cream and the lemon meringue.

The best way to describe is probably an \"extreme\" version of Marble Slab. . .I must say that if you are into Instagram, this is probably a must visit spot because all of their ice creams look ridiculously photogenic.\n\nThe portions are massive, so if you are a normal person you should consider visiting a) on an empty stomach or b) with a friend that will help you get through the monster.\n\nI think the only BIG downside of Fugo is the price. . .I ended up spending $9.32 for an ice cream and I found that to be a little ridiculous.

I got the London Fog (top scoop) and the HK milktea (bottom scoop). Even though i asked for a cup they upgraded me to a cone so ayy. It was 6.75 plus tax. \n\nThe london fog flavour was almost peppery, not sure why. I prefer Richmond Station's version better. The HK milktea flavour was alright, not too sweet which is good depending on what your cravings are. As the waffle cone was already sweet, the lightness of the icecream complimented it rather nicely. \n\nThe shop is ran by two asian guys who look very friendly, lol.
